 kicking around on a piece of ground in your
 waiting for someone or something to show you the
 tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the
 you are young and life is long and there is time to kill
 and then one day you find ten years have got behind
 no one told you when to run you missed the starting
 and you run and you run to catch up with the sun but its
 racing around to come up behind you
 the sun is the same in a relative way but youre
 shorter of breath and one day closer to
 every year is getting shorter never seem to find the
 plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled
 hanging on in quiet desperation is the English

 if as has happened to many local labels Rjam were liquidated to satisfy creditors these would be the pieces But there are stores of value in the converted garage beyond the reach of the auctioneers gavel Schoolly D the original Signifying Rapper looms irresistibly from the pages of rap fanzines HipHop and The Source and Rjams prime unauctionable asset is the consuming ambition of the artists in its stable to be the next Schoolly D Or the next Ice T or Kool Moe Dee or L L Cool J or whoevers the special hero of the kid cutting the demo On this particular morning the dream is to be the next MC Lytea hardrapping woman known for jams like MC Lyte vs Vanna Whyte and 10 Dissince today is TamTams day and TamTam is at 16 a tough girl in the MC Lyte mold who like MC Lyte can dance look good and tell men to beat it all at
 or so claims TamTams producer promoter and dutch uncle Gary Smith who opened RJam on Martin Luther Kings birthday 89 with his older brother Nate Nate the elder statesman is 25 Gary 22 runs the company while Nate travels with his boyhoodfriendturnedboss quadrupleplatinum Princederived rappersinger Bobby Brown RJam was founded in part with an investment from the 23yearold multimillionaire Brown a native of Roxbury Brown now lives in Los
 nate and Gary Smith turn a healthy profit making demos at 500tape but the brothers arent in the health business Their aim to follow in the corporate footsteps of Def Jam a once similarly tiny production company run from a basement in Hollis Queens which since its basement days has given America Public Enemy L L Cool J the Beastie Boys and much of the rest of that culturequake called rap Gary Smith doesnt compare RJam to Def Jam and unlike Def Jams Russell Simmons Gary produces pop soul and RB as well as straight rap and actually prefers RB But how many sophomores at nearby Jeremiah Burke can afford to dream in RB to front music lessons and 500 for an nthhand sound setup find three friends to learn drums bass and keyboards and then raise another 500 to make a demo at RJam Anybody with a larynx can rap however and Rjams brisk business in rap demos pays the taxman Boston Edison and the Chevrolet Motor Credit
 twenty minutes farther south on the Fitzgerald Expressway across the Neponset River and into the pricey suburbs is the scene of John Cheevers boyhood more recently celebrated as Massachusetts Miracle country where technology ventures are started at the rate of five per week four of which will fail within 12 months RJams Gary Smith is secret brother to the men of the suburban Chambers of Commerce sharing their worries about cash flow overhead and the enforceability of his contracts but Garys world and theirs are as far apart as those of Ward and Eldridge Cleaver Worriers in suburbia fear that ballooning property values will hike taxes on computer executives seaside homes In Garys neighborhood property values are actually
 waiting less than patiently for TamTam Gary honks twice A tall grave girl with an angels heartshaped face crosses the ghetto street and climbs into the back seat of RJAM1 She has apparently at least two voices the cynical sexy rant heard on tape this morning telling Pebbles men aint worth it and the whisper in which she now says
 as RJAM1 recrosses North Dorchester heading back to the soundproof studios to get the days work started Gary and DJ Reese hash out production details TamTams a dignified island in the back seat and a shiver accompanies the thought that this could be the Motor City in 63 with Berry Gordy and an eightypound teenage Diana Ross just voted Best Dressed at Cass Technical High School driving crosstown to record a little number called Where Did Our Love
 ask TamTam about Diana Ross and she gives a beatific smile Shes 16 she can remember only with difficulty the first rap she ever listened to when rap was new and she was 8 RunDMC or somebody she mumbles in response to what suddenly seems a foolish question about her influences Like most of raps black audience as distinct from raps white audience which is usually a decade older TamTam has no firsthand recollection of James Brown except as a source for rap She is too young to have attended segregated schools She was in diapers during the violent first few months of desegregation in Boston and cant remember the awful day in 74 when proneighborhood marchers from Irish South Boston came upon a black pedestrian at City Hall and beat him with polemounted American
 tamtam has star presence and like many who do she seems to see very little of what goes on around her the price of the stars intense focus on self She reminds you of Senator Gary Hart He too had star presence In front of a crowd Hart was riveting in the elevator riding up to the auditorium he was barely there Being barely there in the neighborhood TamTam calls home is probably not such a bad thing and perhaps her drive to be star someday is an elaborate way to wall out the now and here Ambition is finally a form of hope a scarce commodity in North
 back in Rjams control booth Dj Reese and producer Ralph Stacey are programming the rhythm track for what will be Ho Youre Guilty Drum parts are taken from a Roland TR909 Rhythm Composer a synth which electronically reproduces programmed beats on the users choice of drummatrix The TR909s keys on a console designed to resemble vaguely the familiar piano are named after the sound each createsbass snare midtom hitomand the sounds are named after the actual drums which until the TR909 were required to make those sounds The TR909 even sports a key named HAND CLAP making it possible for the first time ever to clap hands with a single finger rendering obsolete the Zen koan about the sound of one hand clapping The finished Ho Youre Guilty will sound lush with percussion melody and instrumental breaks Not one human musician will be employed in the recording
 each percussion line is programmed onto the mixing board as a separate track a snare track a bass track a clap track etc Reese has been studying the classics lately too viz James Browns Dead on the Heavy Funk from 75ish including the ageless groove Funky President in which James announces his thirdparty candidacy Some of Bobby Byrds Dead guitar and a holy moment when James exhales rhythmically have been isolated from a storebought cassette of Dead rerecorded on clean tape then rererecorded onto a computerreadable memory diskette from which the sample is retrieved and altered by Ralph Stacey using a Roland D50 linear synth The guitar and the exhalation then go as altered from the synth to yet another of the 24 tracks on the big mixing board Reese the DJ will weave a seamless rhythm track out of these 24
 as Reese and Ralph Stacey mix the 24 tracks onto one master tape TamTam sips lemonade in the corner of the booth You ask her if she is interested someday in learning about the obscure digital technology the two men manipulate on her behalf She doesnt seem to register the question The other career besides rap Id like to pursue is modelling she says Im fiveseven Thats the perfect height for a
 mixing takes the rest of the day Producer Ralph Stacey at one late point corners you with a flinty stare and an uncomfortable question Why do you want to write about rap anyway It is lucky that at that minute Reese is done mixing Tomorrow the RJam staff will tape TamTams vocal track and lay this over Reeses rhythm track Then the sound will be fattened with stacks of horns guitar hooks bells canned applause and whatever else they decide to take from other tapes or work up on the Rolands The final demo tape of Ho Youre Guilty will then be shopped to the 20 major minor and tiny labels who might release the demo as a 12inch
 everyones ready to call it a day Gary Smiths already huddled with some new wannabe stars in RJams reception area Reese plays the mixed rhythm track once through over the big speakers in the control booth and TamTam immediately stands modelling forgotten utterly alert Reese gestures to her with maestro hands She raps at an absent Antoinette in the hard sexy voice you havent heard since this morning extemporaneous but on

 our point of departure essaywise was always less what we know than what we felt listening less what we liked than why For this attempt at an outside sampler we plunked down and listened to thousands of hours of rap trying to summon a kind of objective critical purely aesthetic passion that the music itself made impossible For outsiders raps easy to move to hard to dissect The more we listened and thought and drank beers and argued the more we felt that the stuffs appeal for two highbrow upscale whites was just plain incongruous Because serious rap has right from the start presented itself as a closed show Usually critical questions of culture context background and audience reduce quickly to vexed questions about prepositions Not here No question that serious rap is and is very selfconsciously music by urban blacks about same to and for same To mainstream whites its a tight cohesion that cant but look from outside the cultural window like occlusion clannishness sic and inbreeding a kind of reverse snobbery about whats def and fresh and intheScene that eerily recalls the exclusionary codes of college Societies and WASPonly country clubs Serious rap is a musical movement that seems to revile whites as a group or Establishment and simply to ignore their possibility as distinct individualsthe Great White Male is raps Grand Inquisitor its idiot questionerits Alien Other no less than Reds were for McCarthy The musics paranoia together with its hermetic racial context helps explain why from the outside it appears to us just as vibrant and impassioned as it does alien and
 other incongruities Rap is a music essentially without melody built instead around a digitally synthesized drum and backbeat often about as complex as five idle fingers on a waitingroom table enhanced by sampled pirated krush grooves licks or repetitive chordseries conceived and recorded by prerap rock icons the whole affair characterized by a distinctive spare noisy clattering style whose obsessive if limited thematics revolve with the speed of lowI amperage around the performative circuit of the MCrapper and his recordscratching soundmixing Sancho Panza the

 the masks are many too many for anything really but direct aural inspection rap personae can change frequently even within single albums the rapper delivering Hard violent Black Nationalist communique on one cut dubbing against Trinidadian steel drums on another basking in big label eclat on a third cracking a head and then defly outwitting someone muscled and dumb cooing to his bitch and then on the flip side threatening to go get his gun again if she cant learn whos boss Though any crew naturally wants its own distinctive game and face the quintessential rap group is unquintessential chameleonesque This is either by weird design or its a symptom and symbol of 80s facelessnessor most likely its just a good old venerable synecdoche of raps genre itself one thats now moving so fast it cant quite fix on its own identity much less hold still for anything like cool critical classification or assessment from
 the MCs Alice Toklasesque DJ hovers ever nearby over his buffet of connected turntables and the black Germanness of a whole lot of digital editing playback equipment His responsibility is the song behind and around the rap the backbeat krush groove and the sound carpet ie a kind of electric aural environment a chaos behind the rappers rhymed order a digitalized blend of snippets squeaks screams sirens snatches from pop media all mixed and splattered so that the listener cannot really listen but only feel the resultant mash of samples that results The most recognizable of these samples range from staccato recordscratches to James Brown and Funkadelic licks to MLKs public Dream to quotidian pop pap like The Theme from Shaft Brady Bunch dialogue and 50s detergent

 what makes this stuff so much more disturbing more real to outsiders than the Punk Rock even those of us who remember it could never quite take seriously Maybe even a closed music has to have some kind of detente with received custom I always found it tough to listen straightfaced to a nihilist lecture from someone with a chartreuse mohawk and an earring in his eyelid who punctuates his delivery with vomit and spit All doctrine and pronouncement exclusively anti this Punk of a decade past afforded even willing mainstream listeners no easement across cultural void nothing human to grab onto I have no idea what a Punk performer thinks feels is daytoday in fact I always suspected he had no day but just retreated to his plush coffin at cockcrow Can you imagine a Punk with fourfoot hair and spiked jacket and nosering say eating a bologna sandwich Replacing a light bulb Putting a quarter in a meter Not me boy And even Barnum who knew fear sells also knew that freakshows arent frightening when the freakishness supplants all resemblance 0 affinity 0 empathy And fear requires empathy as much as it does menace or

 our opinion then from a distance not only is a serious rap serious poetry but in terms of the size of its audience its potency in the Great 80s Market its power to spur and to authorize the artistic endeavor of a discouraged and malschooled young urban culture weve been encouraged sadly to write off6 its quite possibly the most important stuff happening in American poetry today Real viz academic US poetry a world no less insular than rap no less strange or stringent about vocab manner and the contexts it works off has today become so inbred and against its professed wishes inaccessible that it just doesnt get to share its creative products with more than a couple thousand fanatical sandalshod readers doesnt get to move or inform more than a fraction of that readership most of the moved being poets themselves doesnt generate revenue for much of anyone save the universities to whom the best PhDpoets rent their names and time and especially does not inspire a whole cultures youth to try to follow in their Connecticutcatalogue brogans prints Because of raps meteoric rise though youve got poor kids tough kids underachievers a lost generation more young peopleostensibly forever turned off language by TV video games and low USDE budgetsmore of these kids hunched over notebooks on their own time trying to put words together in striking and creative ways than the USA has probably ever had at one time That few of these will become stars matters far less than the grim stats about say the tiny percentage of playground basketball phenoms who actually ride sports out and up from subclass status the same verbal skills and enthusiasms rap values and values enough to let rapdissing stand symbolically for fighting or killing can obviously be applied in mainstreamapproved productive waysGEDs college Standard Written English perhaps someday even

 never pack bags and trash you left it kinda sucks that sometimes we have to end

 im feelin all the rhythm you can tell that I am into this voice is more powerful than a million
 suddenly lyrics go demon like its somebody else people want me to grow because of

 im emerging out with a new profession Ima do the best with my new
 and Im doin it Im moving onto this future

 improvin it Im improvin it I got my brain and Im usin
 and Ima make it out alive when Im playin and takin and makin this cash that Im tearing these tools to
 youre clueless ninety percent of yall

 seeming so close I can picture it now success in my drink and Im sippin it
 envisioning deeper ambitions and now Ima get to it that is what livings
 uh 
 uh 
 my voice is gone already
 ayy ayy
 think Ive got a consensus bein lost in the
 adolescent lessons expressin Gods job is to tempt
 makin it hard to stay alive its so easy to
 makin you hang your head low but say Reach for the
 life is a walkin contradiction I see through its
 im just tryna tell the stories Ive seen through its
 i feel Im forcing and feeding of off reasons to
 with all this fake deep bullshit Im too eager to
 yeah everybody sendin blessings in need of
 tryna sell their own tears for they bleedin they
 fuck your demons inside Im in need of the
 so I can summarize my life through my breathing and
 like oh well I can say that I
 hopped into life and then I stayed for the
 so many beautiful faces but they vacant
 and Im just patiently waiting for the day I decide
 this reminds me of days when I drive in
 im screamin Hi to the sky up with a smile on my
 now Im hidin my face I keep tryin to
 all of the steps that I had taken to findin my
 swept out to oceans so lonely waves feel like an
 and now Im lookin at my mic like its sent as a
 i used to be an atheist but that turned me
 recently Ive been wondering if Ive fuckin lost
 see my friends from kindergarten go to
 thats the type of shit that makes you think
 to simpler times blissfully ignorant
 before reality could ground us we would live in the
 and as a and as a kid I never thought Id be bein like this
 man as a kid I never thought this would even
 i felt elusive intangible just steam in the
 and now Im wakin up feelin I aint even this
 you only look at what you got once you see that its
 and lifes too gradual for me to believe in my
 dont understand rappers braggin I got that paper on
 man I got kids in schools who doin presentations on
 so what the fuck you really value tryin to take that from
 to me Ill take that over Rollies and makin some
 rain or sunny Ima do this every day I
 and write these lyrics till my brain is fuzzy
 like Tyler Creator tweets I just
 these Romans tally up my hits with the capital
 this is a natural
 i see it comin from afar Im still actin surprised but I aint mastered the
 i wrote this album so much passion I actually
 they say cause I was never trappin my rap is a
 they think cause Im a awkward kid Im
 as DJ Khaleds son receivin a platinum plaque for bein
 throughout half of my album it wasnt good
 shit I mean it still isnt good
 im like an active volcano I know I could
 but I guess I am not full enough
 i swear the higher you get thats the lower you
 man thats more shit you gotta do or you wont get a
 man thats more shit you gotta prove so they know that its
 thirty seconds of listenin thinkin you know how I
 yeah said this a motherfucking thesis
 yeah came a long way I cannot be
 every day I wake up stressed I have to be the
 and if not then thats a day I truly feel Ive
 most of the pressure on my shoulders is comin from
 so when I die I know I left us with something to
 so when I wake up in the morning with something to
 yeah I got so much shit that Im wantin to
 benny Ben Benjamin Selena Gomez has
 if you ready come get it then everyone is
 many want to get friends with them just in case he is
 got iPhone camera lenses to get the Instagram
 yeah I know Im way too
 but Im workin Im figurin it all
 so when people say you cant that makes you wanna get
 thats benefit of the
 ive been on the top of this never droppin the
 its opposite from the positives got them from talkin
 and Im locked in a pocket of all my thoughts and they keep turnin
 always stoppin my songs cause they keep burnin the sound Im
 yeah this is freedom of
 tryna murder all the people who be keepin the
 sacrifice your whole life cause you need a
 opportunity in front of you you need to achieve Im
 nah Im just tryna find some
 apparently it all has to do with
 there will be obstacles primarily people blinded
 what is carefully being prepared to
 sometimes youll have hilarity parody and
 im askin Hillary Clinton to marry me powerful at the very
 giving you all of my money but never see legacy every day that Im meant to
 everyone here is impaired it is so scary and menacing but I know
 cause I go uh walking away hopping block and whats often the
 shot in the face gun locked and loaded been off at the race droppin the
 off of the place brought in a way predict what I will probably
 and at the end of the day you still talking to me so obviously let the audience
 so let me explain this to those who came in looking at the
 seeing a white kid thinking hes
 when they dont understand that I take risks and I make hits from basic playlist to the
 entertaining the nation be patient whilst waiting for me to break
 reenergize got lyrics to
 start an enterprise of better guys who cannot be successful and never
 thats my dream job bein lazy just
 with the TV on they say that Im bright like
 but I aint takin responsibility pay me for
 limited ability with little
 but whatever Im doin it seems to be killin
 im unwillingly artistically fittin into this
 tryna show you why Im better but none of you believe
 tryna win this gold and try hard good game
 you beat me and now you see me in 3D but you cant feel
 showin up on your device
 consider myself elite measure myself in
 i be talkin way more chill so you can reach
 instead of pretendin you understand what I am talkin
 im the exhibit you kinda scared for like a haunted
 tryna show you something instead of just sittin on the
 ill be honest now I rarely end up walkin
 into reality in normality actually
 found myself doin nothing and you dont laugh at me
 cause ideally you would do the same
 nothing cause for a brain that is
 not complainin but the best part of life is not even livin
 love sleepin and just usin the
 but my time is limited and I better figure
 before Im slippin this opportunity out my
 and let me just tell you what I have came to
 tryna show you I can rap as fast as Im able
 tryna show you I can hop in here like a
 and say some stupid metaphors and leave after Im breakin
 and if a major record label is looking at
 im a nice guy with bad teeth got a nice eye for bad
 i can rap fast and rap
 i may make mistakes but everyone has
 im like MJ back when he had the
 also Im not black so maybe
 but before everyone gets angry
 im that person then people naturally hate me
 all the people who keep on going crazy
 cause I wont be making amazing songs in a mainstream
 a lot of prominent features Im a confident
 with some dominant
 i deserve to be starter but constantly on the
 im awfully smallachiever when Im up on the spot and
 they be fearin this every time that they hearin
 to know that my lyrics have the precision to buildin a
 so when youre nearin this please let me
 when Im standin here frozen please let it
 hear the metronome combined in the
 to unlock superstardom and move all across the
 but that is just a dream and probably a
 of a big ego and false encouragement on the way
 but when Im playin just know its all a big
 i was tryna blow up bang Have a big
 but when you think about it it is all
 what can be created from chemicals in this
 but when you look at me you lackin
 when Im crackin my neck so that I can rap to my
 has in a breath some say that its magic I
 until Im on the same stage and you have it
 but but when you think about the
 you think about how people used to sit and call you
 and you check and wonder if it will be all the
 step back into reality it all remains
 alright I just spilled water on my computer right
 on my computers breaking while Im doing this thirtythousands words
 hold on
 goddamn 
 my lyrics are not showing up on the screen you knowin just what I
 this is off the top I dont need to use no
 hold up I know I can freestyle but I cant do it
 but I am very
 okay okay Im gonna take a drink if youre watching this take a drink
 these are some shit that you can drink
 but drink water unless youre of
 you know what Im saying
 okay 
 uh 
 uh 
 ayy 
 i feel like Im way too different
 and most of humanitys made of
 i barely even get myself and you thinkin you
 you think hiding behind a screen gives you the
 please what I do is barely
 theres hope for me Im noticing people starting to notice
 but still consider me
 still consider me ready and giving out all my
 but honestly all of this is haunting me
 it is just my sense of myself wobbling
 into awfully small pieces normally all
 its tragic and not fleetin it follows me all
 its calling my name constantly makes it so hard to stay
 i close my eyes and let it go and it all fades
 yeah were just tryna find that great
 to get away from how were living life
 some people find it in a drink or in a
 or in some bling or in a drug or in the things that give us
 but all I know is that its
 and all I know is that this stuff isnt enough its way too
 im Jong and Ill like the dictator man what I gotta do to make the quick
 these kidhaters are like ten years old but still claim to be big
 that shit will make me go but Im aiming high and you aiming
 got amazing rhymes and a crazy flow and I may be but I came to
 what I can do when I get on the mic and Im keeping it moving you said Im the
 and Im seeing it through in successes inside I dont take it for granted with plans in this
 set on the wrong forgetting the right like 2 AM in my head in the
 ahead of the best of em lettin the rest of em go off to bed in the
 getting it like I be livin in first class I know that you never will
 getting the worst task for this burnt trash whenever I work
 remember the memos they sendin and sendin again and again and they never will end
 and say it is splendid but never relented and every sentence I say is
 take a deep breath cause I need

 im taking the throne and you chillin and stayin at home Im willing to make it my
 im bakin my cake and you know that Im eating it even if staying up late is the needed
 reason is stayin the same Im just fleein it leavin my life while Im seeing these seasons
 meaning these people aint feelin rich reach in the fire Im heatin
 pleasin these liars theyve they so now theyre receiving it agreeing to be a live without leading
 flows so dope I think its time that we take a
 we all make mistakes and play some hate I got 808s here to save the
 cause I am on top of it lost in my thoughts and I gotta be stoppin it rockin
 you know my flow is so dominant positive confident full of accomplishments
 all of these offers is boring as fuck though I am not a part of

 breaking it up like cartilage flow is so crazy its dope and you know
 i know that you hate to admit it but really this shit is the business rhymes keep

 compared to the big people at the Capital my name is spelt in lower
 people loved me before I made it people liked it before they watched
 im on a way too much more than I have and Im glad because now I will never stop
 man on a mission and I got a vision of talking a lot of wisdom and I gotta

 advancing I know the basics already know them theyre overrated than
 meanwhile I am not rated at all so we hoping because now I am open for
 im charged up I aint Drake but Im on the worst
 so many people they know the players dont know the game and dont know the
 dont know the fakers but who cares Im not here to cater Im here to improve and show that Im
 im here to go move and just go on the layers and bitch I am going so

 and Im on time for the wrong lines and Im not crying so lets start grinding lets
 ive been living life all on my
 all on my own people keep calling my
 wanting to know when Ill be the star of the
 but Im all my own Im all on my
 and I dont want to talk about it stop to doubt
 cause the world is awfully crowded
 the ghost of me is haunting the
 so Ill make it there all on my
 my intermission is mixing with
 and following intuition conflicting with my
 and it is more than just business cause this is for
 and it is to make it look like Im living for something
 and its sad but you know its true for most of
 appearances distracting from the goals that you should go pursue the growing
 sue a new type of thing that you can gain
 to push away the past and the places that you came
 day one for me was like six months
 oh holy
 i actually reached the end of the
 but I still have
 tenthousand more
 hold on I gotta pause
 hold on three its still
 past and the places that you came
 day one for me was like six months
 look at where we been but imagine where one can
 its not fun to know that we just livin to
 we now know how much money you can give for a
 give for a look but how much can you give for an
 whats the point of feeling shit if you just living to
 so get your ass up cause its time to make it
 always been shitty at rappin but I practice for the passion
 yeah Ive been living life all on my own
 i aint the star of the show
 i know like four people who truly respect the
 and its usually left to climb in a newly perfected
 and if time is money then free time aint really
 and sometimes I get pissed cause my own lyrics aint really
 they stemming from a branch of a wishlist on my Christmas
 i want to be whats taunting me but sorry Im a
 in the face of my full potential that is the biggest
 bigger than you bigger than anybody in
 the challenge is a challenge the fact that you got to
 to satisfy a lavish life and have a crazy magic
 and luckily Im so damn young cause man I have the
 to learn from my mistakes and grow into a
 im trying to master my craft and the problem is that Ive
 several different things to potentially make my
 i want to make the MLS and also have a mili
 and also get a mili plays and maybe make a mili

 between you and me The difference is
 you went to a private school your dad and your mom rich as

 all that Huey Newton shit you preachand you marry a white
 whats wrong
 how could a nigga that studied Hue pick the wrong
 only God judge
 you went from a ponytail to blonde hair to
 you change your image a
 you went from a Christian to Muslim now you
 you change your religion a
 you dont know what to do with your Faith like when Biggie saw her in that picture wit
 i had a different
 they lost sight of me
 lost faith in me too many nights I took a
 i saw niggas leave SMACK burn bridges fight to get back
 all over politics we dont like to get
 fans tellin me I should be higher than where Im
 i aint fallin for that Battle Rap Trap Im right Write Where I
 time 
 this the reason I took this battle so bear wit
 i owe Caffeine a lotmore than
 see life had cornered me a cell and Smack afforded me the
 im payin rent in punchlines schemin while Im
 now a Utah niggagivin em somethin to believe
 you can make it to SMACK
 anything is
 and Im tryna celebratetil I learned Twork was in that
 im hurtin wit that obstacle cause thats a bad
 best performer in our sport and he still dont have
 he got 20 million views still cant crack the
 all of that exposure and they say he lack the
 health is wealth my kings and
 the punishment is
 i mean imagine donatin to a GoFundMe for
 rappers thats what we up on kings get paid like
 and Im not one for makin excuses I pray the truth just makes it
 progression is a must but is we vettin who we
 i say sell those fuckin NOME trailers and make sure Twork was blessed as
 but I guess the Caffeine checks is
 you know the profit is
 and now to these debacles Avocado aint
 i know the sponsors wont approve this but he started a new
 i know its right to cut him now but is it foul wit how we
 i am grateful for the
 caffeine has got me
 its just a doubleedged sword when I see the skills they
 me and Holmzie started blackin elicitin
 second round the tech went down Im like Dont tell me this is
 all the money on this matchin please dont do this
 did we truly lose the
 ek please recoup the
 in all that stressin I had a
 i know its rude to do this

 cause with that first Genesis stream wed consider that a choke
 but they takin Avos
 but they takin Avos
 are we just huntin for the
 and if the moneys all that matters can they pay to replace a
 i mean that blanket statements tough but our banking statements
 but if we chain to all that change can we refrain from changing
 and did we forget about Corona on Avocado
 gave us three months of content then followed by a
 look Im acknowledgin the truth Im knowin when in
 but how are judges judgin streams that are goin in and
 and your guess is good as
 im not throwing you a
 i approve of Caffeine we just goin through
 your presence is really needed Im knowing you aint plan
 but this is battle rap where we are holding you to
 see the golden truth is candid and Im not gonna fight

 wondering if he could ever go
