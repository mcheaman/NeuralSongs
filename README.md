#### Sample
Museum of American Rock  
In the shadow of  
The fading sun  
The sound of  
their once proud city  
But it's all being replaced  
By the new menace  

Listen to the wind blow  
By any and all  
For the soothing sound  
And Drums are the new rule  
And the peaceful rider  
Pray come and tomorrow  
For the home of the brave
