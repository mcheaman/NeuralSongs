There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
And she's buying a stairway to Heaven
When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for
Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to Heaven
There's a sign on the wall, but she wants to be sure
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven

Ooh, makes me wonder
Ooh, makes me wonder

There's a feeling I get when I look to the west
And my spirit is crying for leaving
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees
And the voices of those who stand looking

Ooh, it makes me wonder
Ooh, really makes me wonder
And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune
Then the piper will lead us to reason
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long
And the forests will echo with laughter

Oh-oh-oh-oh-woahhh

If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed, now
It's just a spring clean for the May queen
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on

And it makes me wonder
Ohh, woah

Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know
The piper's calling you to join him
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow? And did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind?

And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last
When all are one and one is all
To be a rock and not to roll

And she's buying a stairway to Heaven



Paroles de la chanson Hey Jude :
Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better
Hey Jude, don't be afraid
You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better
And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude
Refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder
Hey Jude, don't let me down
You have found her, now go and get her
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better
So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin
You're waiting for someone to perform with
And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do
The movement you need is on your shoulder
Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her under your skin
Then you'll begin to make it
Better better better better better better, oh
Na na na, na na na na, na na na na, hey Jude...
(repeat... end)



"There must be some kind of way out of here"
Said the joker to the thief
"There's too much confusion
I can't get no relief
Businessmen they drink my wine
Plowmen dig my earth
None will level on the line
Nobody offered his word"
Hey!

"No reason to get excited"
The thief, he kindly spoke
"There are many here among us
Who feel that life is but a joke
But, uh, but you and I, we've been through that
And this is not our fate
So let us stop talkin' falsely now
The hour's getting late
Hey!

Hey!
All along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants too
Well, uh, outside in the cold distance
A wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching
And the wind began to howl
Hey!

All along the watchtower
All along the watchtower



I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction
'Cause I try and I try and I try and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no

When I'm driving in my car
And that man comes on the radio
And he's telling me more and more
About some useless information
Supposed to fire my imagination
I can't get no, oh no, no, no!
Hey, hey, hey! That's what I'll say!

I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction
'Cause I try, and I try, and I try, and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no

When I'm watching my TV
And a man comes on and tells me
How white my shirts can be
Well he can't be a man 'cause he doesn't smoke
The same cigarettes as me
I can't get no, oh no, no, no
Hey, hey, hey, that's what I say
I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no girl reaction
'Cause I try, and I try, and I try, and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no

When I'm riding round the world
And I'm doing this and I'm signing that
And I'm trying to make some girl
Who tells me baby, better come back, maybe next week
'Cause you see, I'm on a losing streak
I can't get no, oh no, no, no
Hey, hey, hey! That's what I'll say!
I can't get no, I can't get no, I can't get no
I can't get no satisfaction
No satisfaction, no satisfaction, no satisfaction
I can't get no



Once upon a time you dressed so fine
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
People call, say "Beware doll, you're bound to fall"
You thought they were all a-kiddin' you
You used to laugh about
Everybody that was hangin' out
Now you don't talk so loud
Now you don't seem so proud
About having to be scrounging your next meal

How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To be without a home?
Like a complete unknown?
Like a rolling stone?

Aw, you've gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely
But ya know ya only used to get juiced in it
Nobody's ever taught ya how to live out on the street
And now you’re gonna have to get used to it
You say you never compromise
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
He's not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And say, “Do you want to make a deal?"
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To be on your own
With no direction home
A complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

Aw, you never turned around to see the frowns
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you
Never understood that it ain't no good
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you
You used to ride on a chrome horse with your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat
Ain't it hard when you discover that
He really wasn't where it's at
After he took from you everything he could steal?

How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To hang on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?
Aw, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
They're all drinkin', thinkin' that they got it made
Exchangin' all precious gifts
But you'd better take your diamond ring, ya better pawn it, babe
You used to be so amused
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used
Go to him now, he calls ya, ya can't refuse
When ya ain't got nothin', you got nothin' to lose
You're invisible now, ya got no secrets to conceal
How does it feel?
Aw, how does it feel?
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?



Wchodzę na podkład jak nóż pod żebro
Po moich zwrotkach miny gwiazd bledną
Nadszedł czas jebnąć
Siać rozpierdol
Pokazać czym jest flow
Pokazać rap tym mendom
Niosę blask splendor
Ty możesz ssać berło
W potopie tandety jestem perłą
Twój rap śmieszny jak kabarety może ssać mi berło
Mój jak te z kasety najczystszy jakby go wyprał Perwoll
Marnej elicie MC czas minął bo zaczął się mój skurwiela z Monte Cassino co scenę rozpieprzy
Znów majk w mej ręce lat przybyło już nie gnój teraz jak wino starszy i lepszy
Skurwysyny chcieli być jak Jackowski chuj im dało to jasnowidzenie myśleli że skończę po 2 trackach
A ja dalej piszę zwrotki zarywając nocki reprezentuję podziemie i tak już 4 lata
Robię na tracku sieczkę jak z mózgu media
Łaków gaszę jak świeczkę mam więcej słów tu niż encyklopedia
Rymy tłuste jak Wini twoje chude jak szczapa
Za poziom rapu nie mnie winić mój najlepszej jakości jak bitmapa
Na pierwszym miejscu jak kiedyś „Another brick in the wall” #Pink_Floyd
Zasób wierszy tekstów ogromny jak King Kong
Malines najlepszy jest tu ty możesz o tym śnić ziom
Sunę po bitach jak surfer na fali
To gorący track że aż serwer się pali
Twój track w którym masz głos damski dobry na skit
Nie jestem łak dlatego nie noszę maski bo mam skill
Elukubracja tworzy ją co druga postać na scenie
Z dala od niej jakbym był na wakacjach moc ma tylko podziemie
To na tracku lata dziewięćdziesiąte w Stanach tylko że w Polsce
Ty łaku skończ ten dramat pośmiewisko oszczędź
Bo się ze śmiechu poszczę
Malines wraca za ster
Ten kawałek to blockbuster
W zapale nie gasnę przejmuję kontrolę nad miastem
Skurwysynów miażdżę jak szczękę kastet
Armią rymów nokautuję jak Miguel Vázquez
Nie brak mi stylu przemysł może cmoknąć mnie w laskę



We'll be fighting in the streets
With our children at our feet
And the morals that they worship will be gone
And the men who spurred us on
Sit in judgment of all wrong
They decide and the shotgun sings the song

I'll tip my hat to the new constitution
Take a bow for the new revolution
Smile and grin at the change all around
Pick up my guitar and play
Just like yesterday
Then I'll get on my knees and pray
We don't get fooled again

Change it had to come
We knew it all along
We were liberated from the fold that's all
And the world looks just the same
And history ain't changed
Cause the banners, they all flown in the last war
I'll tip my hat to the new constitution
Take a vow for the new revolution
Smile and grin at the change all around
Pick up my guitar and play
Just like yesterday
Then I'll get on my knees and pray
We don't get fooled again
No, no!

I'll move myself and my family aside
If we happen to be left half alive
I'll get all my papers and smile at the sky
For I know that the hypnotized never lie
Do ya?

Yeah!
There's nothing in the street
Looks any different to me
And the slogans are replaced, by-the-bye
And the parting on the left
Is now the parting on the right
And the beards have all grown longer overnight
I'll tip my hat to the new constitution
Take a bow for the new revolution
Smile and grin at the change all around
Pick up my guitar and play
Just like yesterday
Then I'll get on my knees and pray
We don't get fooled again
Don't get fooled again
No, no!


YEAAAAAAAAAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Meet the new boss
Same as the old boss



On a dark desert highway
Cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas
Rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance
I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night
There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself
"This could be Heaven or this could be Hell"
Then she lit up a candle
And she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say

"Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year (Any time of year)
You can find it here"
Her mind is Tiffany-twisted
She got the Mercedes Bends, uh
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys
That she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard
Sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember
Some dance to forget
So I called up the Captain
"Please bring me my wine"
He said, "We haven't had that spirit here since 1969"
And still those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say

"Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
They living it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise (What a nice surprise)
Bring your alibis"

Mirrors on the ceiling
The pink champagne on ice
And she said: "We are all just prisoners here
Of our own device"
And in the master's chambers
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast
Last thing I remember, I was
Running for the door
I had to find the passage back
To the place I was before
"Relax," said the night man
"We are programmed to receive
You can check out any time you like
But you can never leave!"



What'll you do when you get lonely
And nobody's waiting by your side
You've been running and hiding much too long
You know it's just your foolish pride

Layla, you've got me on my knees
Layla, I'm begging, darling please
Layla, darling won't you ease my worried mind

I tried to give you consolation
When your old man had let you down
Like a fool, I fell in love with you
Turned my whole world upside down

Layla, you've got me on my knees
Layla, I'm begging, darling please
Layla, darling won't you ease my worried mind

Let's make the best of the situation
Before I finally go insane
Please don't say we'll never find a way
And tell me all my love's in vain
Layla, you've got me on my knees
Layla, I'm begging, darling please
Layla, darling won't you ease my worried mind



One, two, three
Turn it up

Big wheels keep on turnin'
Carry me home to see my kin
Singin' songs about the southland
I miss Alabamy once again
And I think it's a sin, yes

Well I heard Mr Young sing about her (Southern man)
Well, I heard ol' Neil put her down
Well, I hope Neil Young will remember
A Southern man don't need him around, anyhow

Sweet home Alabama
Where the skies are so blue
Sweet home Alabama
Lord, I'm coming home to you

In Birmingham they love the governor (Boo! Boo! Boo!)
Now we all did what we could do
Now Watergate does not bother me
Does your conscience bother you?
Tell the truth
Sweet home Alabama
Where the skies are so blue
Sweet home Alabama
Lord, I'm coming home to you
Here I come, Alabama


(Ah-ah-ah, Alabama
Ah-ah-ah, Alabama
Ah-ah-ah, Alabama
Ah-ah-ah, Alabama)

Now Muscle Shoals has got the Swampers
And they've been known to pick a song or two (Yes, they do)
Lord, they get me off so much
They pick me up when I'm feeling blue
Now how 'bout you?

Sweet home Alabama
Where the skies are so blue
Sweet home Alabama
Lord, I'm coming home to you
Sweet home Alabama (Oh, sweet home, baby)
Where the skies are so blue (And the governor's true)
Sweet home Alabama (Lordy)
Lord, I'm coming home to you (Yeah, yeah)

Mont... Montgomery's got the answer



Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me

Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh (Any way the wind blows)
I don't wanna die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightening me
(Galileo) Galileo, (Galileo) Galileo, Galileo Figaro magnifico
But I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go
(Let him go) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let him go) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Never, never, never, never let me go) Ah
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Oh, mamma mia, mamma mia) Mamma mia, let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me!

So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby!
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here
(Ooh)
(Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah)
Nothing really matters, anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me
Any way the wind blows



Riders on the storm
Riders on the storm
Into this house we're born
Into this world we're thrown
Like a dog without a bone, an actor out on loan
Riders on the storm

There's a killer on the road
His brain is squirmin' like a toad
Take a long holiday
Let your children play
If you give this man a ride, sweet family will die
Killer on the road

Girl you gotta love your man
Girl you gotta love your man
Take him by the hand
Make him understand
The world on you depends, our life will never end
Gotta love your man

Riders on the storm
Riders on the storm
Into this house we're born
Into this world we're thrown
Like a dog without a bone, an actor out on loan
Riders on the storm
Riders on the storm
Riders on the storm
Riders on the storm
Riders on the storm



It's been a long time since I rock and rolled
It's been a long time since I did the Stroll
Ooh, let me get it back, let me get it back
Let me get it back, baby, where I come from

It's been a long time, been a long time
Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time
Yes, it has

It's been a long time since The Book of Love
I can't count the tears of a life with no love
Carry me back, carry me back
Carry me back, baby, where I come from
Whoa, whoa, oh

It's been a long time, been a long time
Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time


Oh! Seems so long since we walked in the moonlight
Making vows that just can't work right
Oh yeah, open your arms, opens your arms
Open your arms, baby, let my love come running in!
Yeah!
It's been a long time, been a long time
Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
It's been a long time, been a long time
Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time



So this ain't the end, I saw you again today
I had to turn my heart away
Smile like the sun, kisses for everyone
And tales, it never fails!

You lying so low into the weeds
I bet you gonna ambush me
You'd have me down, down, down, down on my knees
Now won't you, Barracuda?

Back over time, we were all trying for free
You met the porpoise and me
No right, no wrong, you're selling a song, a name
Whisper game

And if the real thing don't do the trick
You better make up something quick
You gonna burn, burn, burn, burn, burn to the wick
Ooh, Barracuda
"Sell me sell you" the porpoise said
Dive down deep to save my head
I think that you got the blues, too
All that night and all the next
Swam without looking back
Made for the western pools, silly, silly fools!

If the real thing don't do the trick, no
You better make up something quick
You gonna burn, burn, burn, burn, burn it to the wick
Oh, Bara-Barracuda



Rumor spreadin' 'round in that Texas town
About that shack outside La Grange
And you know what I'm talkin' about
Just let me know if you wanna go
To that home out on the range
They gotta lotta nice girls
Have mercy
A-haw haw haw-haw
Heh, a-haw haw haw

Well, I hear it's fine if you got the time
And the ten to get yourself in
A hmm, hmm
And I hear it's tight most every night
But now I might be mistaken
Hmm, hmm, hmm
Have mercy



Every time​ that I look in the mirror
All these lines on my face getting clearer
The past is gone
It went by like dusk to dawn
Isn't that the way?
Everybody's got their dues in life to pay, yeah

I know nobody knows
Where it comes and where it goes
I know it's everybody's sin
You got to lose to know how to win

Half my life's in books' written pages
Lived and learned from fools and from sages
You know it's true
All the things come back to you

Sing with me, sing for the year
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear
Sing with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

Sing with me, sing for the year
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear
Sing with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

Dream on, dream on, dream on
Dream until your dreams come true
Dream on, dream on, dream on
Dream until your dreams come true
Dream on, dream on
Dream on, dream on
Dream on, dream on
Dream on
Aaaaaah!

Sing with me, sing for the year
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear
Sing with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

Sing with me, sing for the year
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear
Sing with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

I looked out this morning and the sun was gone
Turned on some music to start my day
I lost myself in a familiar song
I closed my eyes and I slipped away

It's more than a feeling (more than a feeling)
When I hear that old song they used to play (more than a feeling)
I begin dreaming (more than a feeling)
'Till I see Marianne walk away
I see my Marianne walkin' away

So many people have come and gone
Their faces fade as the years go by
Yet I still recall as I wander on
As clear as the sun in the summer sky

It's more than a feeling (more than a feeling)
When I hear that old song they used to play (more than a feeling)
I begin dreaming (more than a feeling)
'Till I see Marianne walk away
I see my Marianne walkin' away

When I'm tired and thinking cold
I hide in my music, forget the day
And dream of a girl I used to know
I closed my eyes and she slipped away
She slipped away

It's more than a feeling (more than a feeling)
When I hear that old song they used to play (more than a feeling)
I begin dreaming (more than a feeling)
'Till I see Marianne walk away



You get a shiver in the dark
It's raining in the park, but meantime
South of the river
You stop and you hold everything
A band is blowing Dixie
Double four time
You feel alright
When you hear the music ring

Well, now you step inside
But you don't see too many faces
Coming in out of the rain to hear the Jazz go down
Competition in other places
Ah, but the horns, they blowin' that sound
Way on down south
Way on down south, London town

Check out guitar George
He knows all the chords
Mind, it's strictly rhythm
He doesn't want to make it cry or sing
Yes and an old guitar is all he can afford
When he gets up under the lights to play his thing
And Harry doesn't mind if he doesn't make the scene
He's got a daytime job – he's doing alright
He can play the Honky Tonk like anything
Saving it up for Friday night
With the Sultans
With the Sultans of Swing

And a crowd of young boys
They're fooling around in the corner
Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies
And their platform soles
They don't give a damn
About any trumpet playing band
It ain't what they call Rock and Roll
And the Sultans
Yeah, the Sultans, they play Creole
Creole


And then the man
He steps right up to the microphone
And says at last
Just as the time bell rings
"Goodnight, now it's time to go home"
Then he makes it fast
With one more thing
"We are the Sultans –
We are the Sultans of Swing"



She was a fast machine, she kept her motor clean
She was the best damn woman that I ever seen
She had the sightless eyes, telling me no lies
Knocking me out with those American thighs
Taking more than her share, had me fighting for air
She told me to come, but I was already there
'Cause the walls start shaking, the Earth was quaking
My mind was aching, and we were making it

And you shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me all night long

Working double-time on the seduction line
She's one of a kind, she's just a-mine all mine
Wanted no applause, just another course
Made a meal outta me, and come back for more
Had to cool me down to take another round
Now, I'm back in the ring to take another swing
That the walls were shaking, the Earth was quaking
My mind was aching, and we were making it

And you shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me all night long
It knocked me out that
You shook me all night long
It had me shaking
And you shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me
Well, you took me

You really took me and
You shook me all night long
Ah, you shook me all night long
Yeah, yeah, you shook me all night long
You really got me and you, shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me
Yeah, you shook me
All night long



Oh, let the sun beat down upon my face
With stars to fill my dreams
I am a traveler of both time and space
To be where I have been
Sit with elders of the gentle race
This world has seldom seen
Talk of days for which they sit and wait
All will be revealed

Talk and song from tongues of lilting grace
Whose sounds caress my ear
But not a word I heard could I relate
The story was quite clear
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

Ooh, baby, I been flying
No yeah, mama, there ain't no denying
Oh, ooh, yeah I've been flying
Mama, mama, ain't no denying, no denying
Oh, all I see turns to brown
As the sun burns the ground
And my eyes fill with sand
As I scan this wasted land
Trying to find, trying to find, where I've been

Oh, pilot of the storm who leaves no trace
Like thoughts inside a dream
Here is the path that led me to that place
Yellow desert stream
My Shangri-La beneath the summer moon
I will return again
Sure as the dust that floats high in June
When movin' through Kashmir

Oh, father of the four winds, fill my sails
Across the sea of years
With no provision but an open face
Along the straits of fear
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

Ooooh
Oh, when I'm on, when I'm on my way, yeah
When I see, when I see the way, you stay-yeah
Ooh, yeah-yeah, ooh, yeah-yeah, when I'm down
Ooh, yeah-yeah, ooh, yeah-yeah, but I'm down, so down
Ooh, my baby, ooh, my baby, let me take you there
Oh..Come on, oh, let me take you there...let me take you there
Ooh, yeah-yeah, ooh, yeah-yeah, let me take you there...let me take you there



I met her in a club down in old Soho
Where you drink champagne and it tastes just like Coca-Cola
C-O-L-A, Cola
She walked up to me and she asked me to dance
I asked her her name and in a dark brown voice she said, "Lola"
L-O-L-A, Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola

Well, I'm not the world's most physical guy
But when she squeezed me tight, she nearly broke my spine
Oh, my Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola
Well, I'm not dumb, but I can't understand
Why she walks like a woman and talks like a man
Oh, my Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola

Well, we drank champagne and danced all night
Under electric candlelight
She picked me up and sat me on her knee
She said, "Little boy, won't you come home with me?"
Well, I'm not the world's most passionate guy
But when I looked in her eyes, well, I almost fell for my Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola

Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola

I pushed her away
I walked to the door
I fell to the floor
I got down on my knees
Well, I looked at her, and she at me

Well, that's the way that I want it to stay
And I always want it to be that way for my Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola
Girls will be boys and boys will be girls
It's a mixed up, muddled up, shook up world
Except for Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola
Well, I'd left home just a week before
And I'd never, ever kissed a woman before
Lola smiled and took me by the hand
She said, "Little boy, gonna make you a man"
Well I'm not the world's most masculine man
But I know what I am and I'm glad I'm a man
And so is Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola

Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola
Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola
Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola
Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola
Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola
Lola



Carry on, my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more

Once I rose above the noise and confusion
Just to get a glimpse beyond this illusion
I was soaring ever higher
But I flew too high
Though my eyes could see, I still was a blind man
Though my mind could think, I still was a mad man
I hear the voices when I'm dreaming
I can hear them say

Carry on, my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more

Masquerading as a man with a reason
My charade is the event of the season
And if I claim to be a wise man, well
It surely means that I don't know
On a stormy sea of moving emotion
Tossed about I'm like a ship on the ocean
I set a course for winds of fortune
But I hear the voices say
Carry on, my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more, no


Carry on, you will always remember
Carry on, nothing equals the splendor
Now your life's no longer empty
But surely heaven waits for you

Carry on, my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry, don't you cry no more

No more



Blue jean baby, L.A. lady
Seamstress for the band
Pretty-eyed, pirate smile
You'll marry a music man
Ballerina, you must've seen her
Dancing in the sand
And now she's in me, always with me
Tiny dancer in my hand

Jesus freaks out in the street
Handing tickets out for God
Turning back, she just laughs
The boulevard is not that bad
Piano man, he makes his stand
In the auditorium
Looking on, she sings the songs
The words she knows, the tune she hums

But, oh, how it feels so real
Lying here with no one near
Only you, and you can hear me
When I say softly, slowly
Hold me closer, tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today
Hold me closer, tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today

Blue jean baby, L.A. lady
Seamstress for the band
Pretty-eyed, pirate smile
You'll marry a music man
Ballerina, you must've seen her
Dancing in the sand
And now she's in me, always with me
Tiny dancer in my hand

Oh, how it feels so real
Lying here with no one near
Only you, and you can hear me
When I say softly, slowly
Hold me closer, tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today
Hold me closer, tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today



In the shuffling madness
Of the locomotive breath
Runs the all-time loser
Headlong to his death
He feels the piston scraping
Steam breaking on his brow

Old Charlie stole the handle
And the train it won't stop going
No way to slow down
Oh-oh

He sees his children jumping off
At the stations - one by one
His woman and his best friend
In bed and having fun
He's crawling down the corridor
On his hands and knees

Old Charlie stole the handle and
The train it won't stop going
No way to slow down
Hey-hey

He hears the silence howling
Catches angels as they fall
And the all-time winner
Has got him by the balls
Oh, he picks up Gideon's Bible
Open at page one

I said, God, he stole the handle and
The train it won't stop goin'
No way to slow down
No way to slow down
No way to slow down
No way to slow down
No way to slow down
No way to slow down



I have climbed the highest mountains
I have run through the fields
Only to be with you
Only to be with you
I have run, I have crawled
I have scaled these city walls
These city walls
Only to be with you

But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for

I have kissed honey lips
Felt the healing in her fingertips
It burned like fire
This burning desire
I have spoke with the tongue of angels
I have held the hand of a devil
It was warm in the night
I was cold as a stone
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for


I believe in the Kingdom Come
Then all the colours will bleed into one
Bleed into one
But yes, I'm still running
You broke the bonds and you loosed the chains
Carried the cross of my shame
Of my shame
You know I believe it

But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for



{Instrumental}
I like to dream, yes, yes
Right between the sound machine
On a cloud of sound I drift in the night
Any place it goes is right
Goes far, flies near
To the stars away from here
Well, you don't know what we can find
Why don't you come with me, little girl
On a magic carpet ride
You don't know what we can see
Why don't you tell your dreams to me
Fantasy will set you free

Close your eyes, girl
Look inside, girl
Let the sound take you away
{Instrumental}
Last night I hold Aladdin's lamp
And so I wished that I could stay
Before the thing could answer me
Well, someone came and took the lamp away
I looked around, a lousy candle's all I found
Well, you don't know what we can find
Why don't you come with me, little girl
On a magic carpet ride
Well, you don't know what we can see
Why don't you tell your dreams to me
Fantasy will set you free

Close your eyes, girl
Look inside girl
Let the sound
Take you away
{Instrumental}
You don't know what we can find
Why don't you come with me, little girl
On a magic carpet ride...
Well, you don't know what we can see
Why don't you tell your dreams to me
Fantasy will set you free...



If I leave here tomorrow
Would you still remember me?
For I must be traveling on, now
'Cause there's too many places I've got to see

But if I stay here with you, girl
Things just couldn't be the same

'Cause I'm as free as a bird now
And this bird you cannot change
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
And the bird you cannot change
And this bird you cannot change
Lord knows, I can't change

Bye, bye, baby, it's been a sweet love, yeah yeah
Though this feeling I can't change
But please don't take it so badly
'Cause Lord knows I'm to blame
But, if I stay here with you, girl
Things just couldn't be the same

'Cause I'm as free as a bird now
And this bird you'll never change
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
And the bird you cannot change
And this bird you cannot change
Lord knows, I can't change
Lord help me, I can't change

Lord, I can't change
Won't you fly high, free bird, yeah



Purple haze all in my brain
Lately things, they don't seem the same
Acting funny, but I don't know why
'Scuse me while I kiss the sky

Purple haze all around
Don't know if I'm coming up or down
Am I happy or in misery?
Whatever it is, that girl put a spell on me
Help me! Help me!
Ah no, no

Yeah! Purple haze all in my eyes
Don't know if it's day or night
You got me blowing, blowing my mind
Is it tomorrow, or just the end of time?
No, help me
No, yeah purple haze
Oh no, no
Oh, help me
Tell me, tell me
Can't go on like this
You make me blow my mind
No, no, no
No, no, purple haze



A modern-day warrior
Mean, mean stride
Today's Tom Sawyer
Mean, mean pride

Though his mind is not for rent
Don't put him down as arrogant
His reserve a quiet defense
Riding out the day's events
The river

What you say about his company
Is what you say about society
Catch the mist
Catch the myth
Catch the mystery
Catch the drift

The world is, the world is
Love and life are deep
Maybe as his skies are wide
Today's Tom Sawyer, he gets high on you
And the space he invades, he gets by on you

No, his mind is not for rent
To any god or government
Always hopeful, yet discontent
He knows changes aren't permanent
But change is

And what you say about his company
Is what you say about society
Catch the witness
Catch the wit
Catch the spirit
Catch the spit

The world is, the world is
Love and life are deep
Maybe as his eyes are wide

Exit the warrior
Today's Tom Sawyer
He gets high on you
And the energy you trade
He gets right on to
The friction of the day



When I find myself in times of trouble, Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, "Let it be"
And in my hour of darkness, she is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, "Let it be"

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

And when the brokenhearted people living in the world agree
There will be an answer, let it be
For though they may be parted, there is still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Yeah, there will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
And when the night is cloudy, there is still a light that shines on me
Shine on 'til tomorrow, let it be
I wake up to the sound of music, Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, "Let it be"

Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be
Oh there will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be
Oh there will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be



Out here in the fields, I fight for my meals
I get my back into my living
I don't need to fight to prove I'm right
I don't need to be forgiven, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ye-ah

Don't cry, don't raise your eye
It's only teenage wasteland

Sally, take my hand, we'll travel south 'cross land
Put out the fire and don't look past my shoulder
The exodus is here, the happy ones are near
Let's get together before we get much older

Teenage wasteland, it's only teenage wasteland
Teenage wasteland, oh, yeah
Teenage wasteland
They're all wasted!



Some people call me the space cowboy, yeah
Some call me the gangster of love
Some people call me Maurice
'Cause I speak of the pompatus of love
People talk about me, baby
Say I'm doing you wrong, doing you wrong
Well, don't you worry, baby, don't worry
'Cause I'm right here, right here, right here, right here at home

'Cause I'm a picker, I'm a grinner
I'm a lover, and I'm a sinner
I play my music in the sun
I'm a joker, I'm a smoker
I'm a midnight toker
I sure don't want to hurt no one
I'm a picker, I'm a grinner
I'm a lover, and I'm a sinner
I play my music in the sun
I'm a joker, I'm a smoker
I'm a midnight toker
I get my lovin' on the run
Whoo
Whoo
You're the cutest thing that I ever did see
I really love your peaches, wanna shake your tree
Lovey-dovey, lovey-dovey, lovey-dovey all the time
Oee, baby, I'll sure show you a good time

'Cause I'm a picker, I'm a grinner
I'm a lover, and I'm a sinner
I play my music in the sun
I'm a joker, I'm a smoker
I'm a midnight toker
I get my lovin' on the run
I'm a picker, I'm a grinner
I'm a lover, and I'm a sinner
I play my music in the sun
I'm a joker, I'm a smoker
I'm a midnight toker
I sure don't want to hurt no one
Whoo

People keep talking about me, baby
Say I'm doing you wrong
Well, don't you worry, don't worry, no, don't worry, mama
'Cause I'm right here at home
You're the cutest thing I ever did see
Really love your peaches, wanna shake your tree
Lovey-dovey, lovey-dovey, lovey-dovey all the time
C'mon baby, now I'll show you a good time



Roxanne
You don't have to put on the red light
Those days are over
You don't have to sell your body to the night
Roxanne
You don't have to wear that dress tonight
Walk the streets for money
You don't care if it's wrong or if it's right

Roxanne
You don't have to put on the red light
Roxanne
You don't have to put on the red light

(Roxanne) Put on the red light
(Roxanne) Put on the red light
(Roxanne) Put on the red light
(Roxanne) Put on the red light
(Roxanne) Put on the red light, oh

I loved you since I knew you
I wouldn't talk down to ya
I have to tell you just how I feel
I won't share you with another boy
I know my mind is made up
So put away your make up
Told you once
I won't tell you again it's a bad way
Roxanne
You don't have to put on the red light
Roxanne
You don't have to put on the red light

(Roxanne) Put on the red light



Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day
Fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your hometown
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way
Tired of lying in the sunshine, staying home to watch the rain
You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today
And then one day you find ten years have got behind you
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun

And you run, and you run to catch up with the sun, but it's sinking
Racing around to come up behind you again
The sun is the same in a relative way, but you're older
Shorter of breath, and one day closer to death
Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time
Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way
The time is gone, the song is over, thought I'd something more to say

Home, home again
I like to be here when I can
And when I come home cold and tired
It's good to warm my bones beside the fire
Far away across the field
The tolling of the iron bell
Calls the faithful to their knees
To hear the softly spoken magic spells



Paroles de la chanson It's A Long Way To The Top (ac/dc) :

Ridin' down the highway
Goin' to a show
Stop in all the by-ways
Playin' rock 'n' roll
Gettin' robbed
Gettin' stoned
Gettin' beat up
Broken boned
Gettin' had
Gettin' took
I tell you folks
It's harder than it looks
It's a long way to the top
If you wanna rock 'n' roll
It's a long way to the top
If you wanna rock 'n' roll
If you think it's easy doin' one night stands
Try playin' in a rock roll band
It's a long way to the top
If you wanna rock 'n' roll
Hotel, motel
Make you wanna cry
Lady do the hard sell
Know the reason why
Gettin' old
Gettin' grey
Gettin' ripped off
Under-paid
Gettin' sold
Second hand
That's how it goes
Playin' in a band
It's a long way to the top
If you wanna rock 'n' roll
It's a long way to the top
If you wanna rock 'n' roll
If you wanna be a star of stage and screen
Look out it's rough and mean
It's a long way to the top
If you wanna rock 'n' roll
It's a long way to the top
If you wanna rock 'n' roll
Well, it's a long way
It's a long way, (they tell me)
It's a long way, such a long way, (bagpipe)

There's something happening here
But what it is ain't exactly clear
There's a man with a gun over there
A-telling me I got to beware

I think it's time we stop
Children, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's going down

There's battle lines being drawn
And nobody's right if everybody's wrong
Young people speaking their minds
Are gettin' so much resistance from behind

It's time we stop
Hey, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's going down

What a field day for the heat (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
A thousand people in the street (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Singing songs and a-carryin' signs (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Mostly say, "Hooray for our side" (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
It's time we stopped
Hey, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's going down

Paranoia strikes deep
Into your life, it will creep
It starts when you're always afraid
Step out of line, the man come and take you away

We better stop
Hey, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's going
We better stop
Hey, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's going
We better stop
Now, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's going
We better stop
Children, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's going down



Got a black magic woman
Got a black magic woman
I got a black magic woman
Got me so blind I can't see
That she's a black magic woman
She's tryin' to make a devil out of me
Don't turn your back on me baby
Don't turn your back on me baby
Yes, don't turn your back on me baby
Stop messin' 'round with your tricks
Don't turn your back on me baby
You just might pick up my magic sticks
Ah!
Got your spell on me baby
Got your spell on me baby
Yes, you got your spell on me baby
Turning my heart into stone
I need you so bad, magic woman
I can't leave you alone



Nights in white satin, never reaching the end
Letters I've written, never meaning to send
Beauty I'd always missed, with these eyes before
Just what the truth is, I can't say anymore

'Cause I love you
Yes, I love you
Oh, I love you

Gazing at people, some hand in hand
Just what I'm going through, they can't understand
Some try to tell me thoughts they cannot defend
Just what you want to be, you will be in the end

And I love you
Yes, I love you
Ah, how I love you
Ah, how I love you


Nights in white satin, never reaching the end
Letters I've written, never meaning to send
Beauty I've always missed, with these eyes before
Just what the truth is, I can't say anymore
'Cause I love you
Yes, I love you
Oh, how I love you
Oh, how I love you
'Cause I love you
Yes, I love you
Oh, how I love you
Oh, how I love you

Breathe deep the gathering gloom
Watch lights fade from every room
Bedsitter people look back and lament
Another day's useless energy spent
Impassioned lovers wrestle as one
Lonely man cries for love and has none
New mother picks up and suckles her son
Senior citizens wish they were young
Cold hearted orb that rules the night
Removes the colours from our sight
Red is grey and yellow white
But we decide which is right
And which is an illusion?



I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
I look at the floor, and I see it needs sweeping
Still my guitar gently weeps

I don't know why nobody told you
How to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you

I look at the world, and I notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps
With every mistake, we must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps


I don't know how you were diverted
You were perverted too
I don't know how you were inverted
No one alerted you
I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
(I look) Look at you all
Still my guitar gently weeps

Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, ooh



Oooooh
Oooooh
Oooooh

Ooh, a storm is threat'ning
My very life today
If I don't get some shelter
Ooh yeah, I'm gonna fade away

War, children
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
War, children
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away

Ooh, see the fire is sweeping
Our very street today
Burns like a red coal carpet
Mad bull lost your way

War, children, yeah
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
War, children,yeah
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
2:03 - 2:43
Hey, hey

Rape, murder
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
Rape, murder, yeah
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
Rape, murder (Woo!)
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
Yeah

Mmm, the floods is threat'ning
My very life today
Gimme, gimme shelter
Or I'm going to fade away

War, children
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away
I tell you love, sister
It's just a kiss away, it's just a kiss away
It's just a kiss away, it's just a kiss away
It's just a kiss away, (kiss away kiss away)



Rock on, gold dust woman
Take your silver spoon, dig your grave
Heartless challenge
Pick your path and I’ll pray
Wake up in the morning
See your sunrise, loves to go down
Lousy lovers pick their prey
But they never cry out loud, cry out

Well, did she make you cry?
Make you break down?
Shatter your illusions of love
And is it over now? Do you know how?
Pick up the pieces and go home

Rock on, ancient queen
Follow those who pale in your shadow
Rulers make bad lovers
You better put your kingdom up for sale
Up for sale

Well, did she make you cry?
Make you break down?
Shatter your illusions of love
Well, is it over now? Do you know how?
Pick up the pieces and go home
Well did she make you cry?
Make you break down?
Shatter your illusions of love
And now tell me, is it over now?
Do you know how to pick up the pieces
And go home? And go home, and go home

Ooh, pale shadow of a woman
Black widow
Pale shadow of a dragon
Dust woman
Ooh, pale shadow of a woman
Ooh, black widow
Ooh, pale shadow, she’s a dragon
Gold dust woman
Woman, woman



A long, long time ago
I can still remember
How that music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while
But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step
I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
But something touched me deep inside
The day the music died

So bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye
Singin', "This'll be the day that I die"
"This'll be the day that I die"

Did you write the book of love
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Now do you believe in rock 'n roll
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?
Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues
I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died
I started singin', "Bye-bye, Miss American Pie"
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye
And singin', "This'll be the day that I die"
"This'll be the day that I die"

Now, for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rollin' stone
But that's not how it used to be
When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me
Oh, and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned
And while Lennin read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died

We were singin', "Bye-bye, Miss American Pie"
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye
And singin', "This'll be the day that I die"
"This'll be the day that I die"
Helter skelter in a summer swelter
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and fallin' fast
It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast
Now, the half-time air was sweet perfume
While the sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance
'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?

We started singin', "Bye-bye, Miss American Pie"
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye
And singin', "This'll be the day that I die"
"This'll be the day that I die"

Oh, and there we were, all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again
So come on, Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the devil's only friend
Oh, and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in hell
Could break that Satan's spell
And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died
We were singin', "Bye-bye Miss American Pie"
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye
And singin', "This'll be the day that I die"
"This'll be the day that I die..."

I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away
I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play
And in the streets, the children screamed
The lovers cried and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken
And the three men I admire most
The father, son, and the holy ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died
And there I stood alone and afraid
I dropped to my knees and there I prayed
And I promised Him everything I could give
If only He would make the music live
And He promised it would live once more
But this time one would equal four
And in five years four had come to mourn
And the music was reborn

And they were singin', "Bye-bye Miss American Pie"
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye
Singin', "This'll be the day that I die"
"This'll be the day that I die"

They were singin', "Bye-bye Miss American Pie"
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye
Singin', "This'll be the day that I die..."



Mmm

Company, always on the run
Destiny, mmm, is a rising sun
Oh, I was born six-gun in my hand
Behind a gun, I make my final stand, hey
It's why they call me

Bad company and I can't deny
Bad company 'til the day I die
Oh, 'til the day I die
'Til the day I die

Rebel souls, deserters we are called
Chose a gun and threw away the song
Now these towns, they all know our name
Six-gun sound is our claim to fame
I can hear them say

Bad company and I won't deny
Bad, bad company 'til the day I die
Ha, ha, oh yeah
'Til the day I die, ooh
Oh

Hey, hey, hey
Bad company, I can't deny
Bad company 'til the day I die
What'd I say now?
Is bad company
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Bad company 'til the day I die
Whoa yes

Said I'm young and I'm free
Oh, but I'm-a bad company
That's the way I play, yeah
Dirty for dirty, heh
Oh, somebody double-cross me
Double-cross for double-cross
Yeah, we're bad company
Oh, the cold wind blowing, ah
Mmm yeah



Hey lady, you got the love I need
Maybe more than enough
Oh darling, darling, darling; walk a while with me
Oh, you've got so much, so much, so much
Many have I loved, and many times been bitten
Many times I've gazed along the open road
Many times I've lied, and many times I've listened
Many times I've wondered how much there is to know
Many dreams come true, and some have silver linings
I live for my dream and a pocketful of gold

Mellow is the man who knows what he's been missing
Many, many men can't see the open road
Many is a word that only leaves you guessing
Guessing 'bout a thing you really ought to know, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Really ought to know (oh, oh, oh)
I really ought to know
Oh, you know I should, you know I should
You know I should've known



​
Move yourself
You always live your life
Never thinking of the future
Prove yourself
You are the move you make
Take your chances, win or loser
See yourself
You are the steps you take
You and you, and that's the only way
Shake, shake yourself
You're every move you make
So the story goes

Owner of a lonely heart
Owner of a lonely heart
(Much better than a)
Owner of a broken heart
Owner of a lonely heart
I know (x3)
Maybe there's another way to do this
{​Music Video - Break}​

Say - you don't want to chance it
You've been hurt so before
Watch it now
The eagle in the sky
How he dancin' one and only
You, lose yourself
No not for pity's sake
There's no real reason to be lonely
Be yourself
Give your free will a chance
You've got to want to succeed

Owner of a lonely heart
Owner of a lonely heart
(Much better than a)
Owner of a broken heart
Owner of a lonely heart
Owner of a lonely heart

After my own indecision
They confused me so
Owner of a lonely heart
My love said never question your will at all
In the end you've got to go
Look before you leap
Owner of a lonely heart
And don't you hesitate at all - no no
Yow!
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah!
{​Instrumental}​

Owner of a lonely heart
Owner of a lonely heart
(Much better than a)
Owner of a broken heart
Owner of a lonely heart
Owner of a lonely heart
Owner of a lonely heart
(Much better than a)
Owner of a broken heart
Owner of a lonely heart
Owner of a lonely heart

Sooner or later each conclusion
Will decide the lonely heart
Owner of a lonely heart
It will excite, it will delight
It will give a better start
Owner of a lonely heart
Don't deceive your free will at all
Don't deceive your free will at all
Owner of a lonely heart
Don't deceive your free will at all
Just receive it
Just receive it
(Owner of a lonely heart)



When I was young, it seemed that life was so wonderful
A miracle, oh, it was beautiful, magical
And all the birds in the trees, well, they'd be singing so happily
Oh, joyfully, oh, playfully watching me
But then they sent me away to teach me how to be sensible
Logical, oh, responsible, practical
And then they showed me a world where I could be so dependable
Oh, clinical, oh, intellectual, cynical

There are times when all the world's asleep
The questions run too deep
For such a simple man
Won't you please, please tell me what we've learned?
I know it sounds absurd
Please tell me who I am

I said, watch what you say or they'll be calling you a radical
A liberal, oh, fanatical, criminal
Oh, won't you sign up your name? We'd like to feel you're acceptable
Respectable, oh, presentable, a vegetable
Oh, take, take, take it, yeah

But at night, when all the world's asleep
The questions run so deep
For such a simple man
Won't you please (Won't you tell me)
Please tell me what we've learned?
(Can you hear me?) I know it sounds absurd
(Won't you help me?) But please, tell me who I am
Who I am
Who I am
Who I am
Yeah!
Oh!
Ooo!
Hey!

'Cause I was feeling so illogical
D-d-d-d-d-d-digital
Yeah, one, two, three, five
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Ooh, it's getting unbelievable
Yeah
B-b-bloody marvelous



I read the news today—oh, boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well, I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords

I saw a film today, oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book

I'd love to turn you on
*alarm clock rings*
Woke up, fell out of bed
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up I noticed I was late
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream
Ahh-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, Ah-ah-ahh

I read the news today—oh, boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall

I'd love to turn you on



Sweet emotion
Sweet emotion

Talk about things that nobody cares
Wearing other things that nobody wears
You're calling my name but I got to make clear
I can't say baby where I'll be in a year


Some sweat hog mama with a face like a gent
Said my get up and go, musta got up and went
Well I got good news, she's a real good liar
'Cause the backstage boogie set your pants on fire

Sweet emotion
Sweet emotion

I pulled into town in a police car
Your daddy said I took it just a little too far
You're telling me things but your girlfriend lied
You can't catch me because the rabbit done died, yes it did

You stand in the front just a shaking your ass
I'll take you backstage you can drink from my glass
I'll talk about something you're sure to understand
'Cause a month on the road and I'll be eating from your hand



Early in the evenin' just about supper time
Over by the courthouse they're starting to unwind
Four kids on the corner trying to bring you up
Willy picks a tune out and he blows it on the harp
Down on the corner, out in the street
Willy and the poorboys are playin'
Bring a nickel, tap your feet
Rooster hits the washboard and people just got to smile
Blinky, thumps the gut bass and solos for a while
Poorboy twangs the rhythm out on his kalamazoo
Willy goes into a dance and doubles on kazoo
Down on the corner, out in the street
Willy and the Poorboys are playin'
Bring a nickel, tap your feet
Down on the corner, out in the street
Willy and the poorboys are playin'
Bring a nickel, tap your feet
You don't need a penny just to hang around
But if you've got a nickel, won't you lay your money down?
Over on the corner there's a happy noise
People come from all around to watch the magic boy
Down on the corner, out in the street
Willy and the poorboys are playin'
Bring a nickel, tap your feet
Down on the corner, out in the street
Willy and the poorboys are playin'
Bring a nickel, tap your feet

Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven’s door

I don't mind you comin' here
And wastin' all my time
'Cause when you're standin' oh so near
I kinda lose my mind

It's not the perfume that you wear
It's not the ribbons in your hair
And I don't mind you comin' here
And wastin' all my time

I don't mind you hangin' out
And talkin' in your sleep
It doesn't matter where you've been
As long as it was deep, yeah

You always knew to wear it well and
You look so fancy I can tell
And I don't mind you hangin' out
And talkin' in your sleep
I guess you're just what I needed
(Just what I needed)
I needed someone to feed
I guess you're just what I needed
(Just what I needed)
I needed someone to bleed

I don't mind you comin' here
And wastin' all my time, time
'Cause when you're standin' oh so near
I kinda lose my mind, yeah

It's not the perfume that you wear
It's not the ribbons in your hair
And I don't mind you comin' here
And wastin' all my time

I guess you're just what I needed

All our times have come
Here, but now they're gone
Seasons don't fear the reaper
Nor do the wind, the sun or the rain

(We can be like they are) Come on, baby
(Don't fear the Reaper) Baby, take my hand
(Don't fear the Reaper) We'll be able to fly
(Don't fear the Reaper) Baby, I'm your man
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la

Valentine is done
Here, but now they're gone
Romeo and Juliet
Are together in eternity (Romeo and Juliet)
40,000 men and women everyday (Like Romeo and Juliet)
40,000 men and women everyday (Redefine happiness)
Another 40,000 coming everyday
(We can be like they are) Come on, baby
(Don't fear the Reaper) Baby, take my hand
(Don't fear the Reaper) We'll be able to fly
(Don't fear the Reaper) Baby, I'm your man
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la

Love of two is one
Here, but now they're gone
Came the last night of sadness
And it was clear she couldn't go on
The door was open and the wind appeared
The candles blew and then disappeared
The curtains flew and then he appeared

(Saying, "don't be afraid") Come on, baby
(And she had no fear) And she ran to him
(Then she started to fly) They looked backward and said goodbye
(She had become like they are) She had taken his hand
(She had become like they are) Come on, baby
(Don't fear the Reaper)



No one knows what it's like
To be the bad man, to be the sad man
Behind blue eyes
No one knows what it's like
To be hated, to be fated
To telling only lies

But my dreams, they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance that's never free

No one knows what it's like
To feel these feelings like I do
And I blame you
No one bites back as hard
On their anger, none of my pain and woe
Can show through

But my dreams, they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance that's never free
When my fist clenches, crack it open
Before I use it and lose my cool
When I smile, tell me some bad news
Before I laugh and act like a fool
And if I swallow anything evil
Put your finger down my throat
And if I shiver, please give me a blanket
Keep me warm, let me wear your coat

No one knows what it's like
To be the bad man, to be the sad man
Behind blue eyes



In the mornin you go gunnin'
For the man who stole your water
And you fire till he is done in
But they catch you at the border
And the mourners are all sangin'
As they drag you by your feet
But the hangman isn't hangin'
And they put you on the street

Yeah, you go back, Jack, do it again
Wheel turnin' 'round and 'round
You go back, Jack, do it again

When you know she's no high climber
Then you find your only friend
In a room with your two timer
And you're sure you're near the end
Then you love a little wild one
And she brings you only sorrow
All the time you know she's smilin'
You'll be on your knees tomorrow
Yeah, you go back, Jack, do it again
Wheel turnin' 'round and 'round
You go back, Jack, do it again


Now you swear and kick and beg us
That you're not a gambling man
Then you find you're back in Vegas
With a handle in your hand
Your black cards can make you money
So you hide them when you're able
In the land of milk and honey
You must put them on the table

Yeah, you go back, Jack, do it again
Wheel turnin' 'round and 'round
You go back, Jack, do it again



I walked forty-seven miles of barbed wire
I got a cobra snake for a necktie
A brand new house on the road side
And it's a-made out of rattlesnake hide
Got a band new chimney put on top
And it's a-made out of human skull
Come on take a little walk with me baby
And tell me who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Around the town I use a rattlesnake whip
Take it easy baby don't you give me no lip
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
I've got a tombstone hand and a graveyard mind
I'm just twenty-two and I don't mind dying
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Now Arlene took a-me by my hand
She said "Lonesome George you don't understand
Who do you love? "
The night were dark and the sky were blue
Down the alleyway a house wagon flew
Hit a bump and somebody screamed
You should've heard what I'd seen
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Yeah, I've got a tombstone hand in a graveyard mine
Just twenty-two baby I don't mind dying
Snake skin shoes baby put them on your feet
Got the goodtime music and the Bo Diddley beat
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
I walked forty-seven miles of barbed wire
I got a cobra snake for a necktie
A brand new house on the road side
And it's made out of rattlesnake hide
Got a band new chimney put on top
And it's made out of human skull
Come on take a little walk with me child
Tell me who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?



The leaves are falling all around, time I was on my way
Thanks to you, I'm much obliged for such a pleasant stay
But now it's time for me to go, the autumn moon lights my way
For now I smell the rain, and with it pain, and it's headed my way
Ah, sometimes I grow so tired
But I know I've got one thing I got to do

Ramble on, and now's the time, the time is now
To sing my song, I'm going 'round the world, I gotta find my girl
On my way, I've been this way ten years to the day
Ramble on, gotta find the queen of all my dreams

Got no time to for spreading roots
The time has come to be gone
And though "Our health" we drank a thousand times
It's time to ramble on

Ramble on, and now the time, the time is now
To sing my song, I'm going 'round the world, I gotta find my girl
On my way, I've been this way ten years to the day
I gotta ramble on, I gotta find the queen of all my dreams
I tell you no lie

Mine's a tale that can't be told, my freedom I hold dear
How years ago in days of old, when magic filled the air
'Twas in the darkest depths of Mordor, I met a girl so fair
But Gollum, and the evil one crept up and slipped away with her
Her, her, yeah
Ah, there's nothing I can do now
I guess I'll keep on

Ramblin', I'm gonna shake (Sing my song)
I gotta find my baby
I'm gonna ramble on, sing my song
Gonna work my way, going 'round the world
Baby, baby (Ramble on)
Do do do do do do do do, my baby
I can't stop this feeling in my heart
Every time I think about my baby I think "we gots to part"
Gotta keep on searching for my baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
I gotta keep on searching for my baby
My, my, my, my, my, my, baby
I can't find my bluebird!
I listened to what my bluebird said, but I, I can't find my bluebird!
I keep rambling, baby



Everywhere is
Freaks and hairies
Dykes and fairies
Tell me, where is sanity?

Tax the rich
Feed the poor
Till there are no
Rich no more

I'd love to change the world
But I don't know what to do
So I'll leave it up to you

Population
Keeps on breeding
Nation bleeding
Still more feeding, economy

Life is funny
Skies are sunny
Bees make honey
Who needs money? No, not poor me
I'd love to change the world
But I don't know what to do
So I'll leave it up to you

Oh yeah!

World pollution
Is no solution
Institution
Electrocution
Spread them wide
Rich or poor
Them and us
Stop the war

I'd love to change the world
But I don't know what to do
So I'll leave it up to you



It's been such a long time
I think I should be goin', yeah
And time doesn't wait for me
It keeps on rollin'

Sail on, on a distant highway, yeah
I've got to keep on chasin' a dream
I've gotta be on my way
Wish there was something I could say

Well, I'm takin' my time, I'm just movin' along
You'll forget about me after I've been gone
And I take what I find, I don't want no more
It's just outside of your front door

Ah yeah yeah yeah
It's been such a long time
It's been such a long time
Hey
Well I get so lonely
When I am without you-ooo
But in my mind, deep in my mind
I can't forget about you, ohh

Now good times
And faces that remind me, yeah
I'm tryin' to forget your name
And leave it all behind me
You're comin' back to find me

Well, I'm takin' my time, I'm just movin' along
You'll forget about me after I've been gone
And I take what I find, I don't want no more
It's just outside of your front door

Yeah yeah yeah, hey
It's been such a long time
It's been such a long time

Yeah, It's been such a long time
I think I should be goin', yeah
And time doesn't wait for me
It keeps on rollin'

There's a long road
I've gotta stay in time with, yeah
I've got to keep on chasin' that dream
Though I may never find it
I'm always just behind it, oo ooo

Well, I'm takin' my time, I'm just movin' along

Takin' my time (oh just takin' my time)
Takin' my time (just outside-a your front door)
Takin' my time



Hey, where did we go?
Days when the rains came
Down in the hollow
Playin' a new game
Laughing and a running, hey, hey
Skipping and a jumping
In the misty morning fog with
Our hearts a thumpin' and you
My brown-eyed girl
You, my brown-eyed girl

Whatever happened
To Tuesday and so slow?
Going down the old mine
With a transistor radio
Standing in the sunlight laughing
Hiding behind a rainbow's wall
Slipping and sliding
All along the waterfall, with you
My brown-eyed girl
You, my brown-eyed girl

Do you remember when we used to sing
Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da
Just like that
Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da la te da
So hard to find my way
Now that I'm all on my own
I saw you just the other day
My, how you have grown
Cast my memory back there, Lord
Sometimes I'm overcome thinking 'bout
Making love in the green grass
Behind the stadium with you
My brown-eyed girl
You, my brown-eyed girl

Do you remember when we used to sing
Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da
Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da la te da
Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da la te da



Back in black, I hit the sack
I've been too long, I'm glad to be back
Yes, I'm let loose from the noose
That's kept me hanging about
I'm just looking at the sky 'cause it's getting me high
Forget the hearse, 'cause I'll never die
I got nine lives, cat's eyes
Abusing every one of them and running wild

'Cause I'm back, yes I'm back
Well, I'm back, yes I'm back
Well, I'm back, back
Well, I'm back in black
Yes, I'm back in black

Back in the back of a Cadillac
Number one with a bullet, I'm a power pack
Yes, I'm in a bang with a gang
They've got to catch me if they want me to hang
'Cause I'm back on the track and I'm beatin' the flack
Nobody's gonna get me on another rap
So, look at me now, I'm just making my play
Don't try to push your luck, just get out of my way
'Cause I'm back, yes I'm back
Well, I'm back, yes I'm back
Well, I'm back, back
Well, I'm back in black
Yes, I'm back in black


Well, I'm back, yes I'm back

Well, I'm running down the road tryin' to loosen my load
I've got seven women on my mind
Four that wanna own me, two that wanna stone me
One says she's a friend of mine

Take It easy, take it easy
Don't let the sound of your own wheels drive you crazy
Lighten up while you still can
Don't even try to understand
Just find a place to make your stand and take it easy

Well, I'm a standing on a corner in Winslow, Arizona
And such a fine sight to see
It's a girl, my Lord, in a flatbed Ford
Slowin' down to take a look at me

Come on, baby, don't say maybe
I gotta know if your sweet love is gonna save me
We may lose, and we may win
Though we will never be here again
So open up, I'm climbin' in
So take it easy
Well I'm running down the road trying to loosen my load
Got a world of trouble on my mind
Lookin' for a lover who won't blow my cover
She's so hard to find

Take it easy, take it easy
Don't let the sound of your own wheels make you crazy
Come on baby, don't say maybe
I gotta know if your sweet love is gonna save me, oh oh oh
Oh we got it easy
We oughta take it easy



Billy Shears!

What would you think if I sang out of tune?
Would you stand up and walk out on me?
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song
And I'll try not to sing out of key

Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends
Mm, I get high with a little help from my friends
Mm, gonna try with a little help from my friends
What do I do when my love is away?
Does it worry you to be alone?
How do I feel by the end of the day?
Are you sad because you're on your own?

No, I get by with a little help from my friends
Mm, get high with a little help from my friends
Mm, I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends
Do you need anybody?
I need somebody to love
Could it be anybody?
I want somebody to love
Would you believe in a love at first sight?
Yes, I'm certain that it happens all the time
What do you see when you turn out the light?
I can't tell you, but I know it's mine

Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends
Mm, get high with a little help from my friends
Oh, I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends
Do you need anybody?

Could it be anybody?

Dancing days are here again
As the summer evenings grow
I got my flower, I got my power
I got a woman who knows

I said it's alright, you know it's alright
I guess it's all in my heart
You'll be my only, my one and only
Is that the way it should start?

Crazy ways are evident
By the way you wearing your clothes
Sipping booze is precedent
As the evening starts to glow

You know it's alright, I said it's alright
You know it's all in my heart
You'll be my only, my one and only
Is that the way it should start?
Dig

You told your mama I'd get you home
But you didn't say that I got no car
I saw a lion, he was standing alone
With a tadpole in a jar
You know it's alright
I said it's alright
I guess it's all in my heart, heart, heart, heart
You'll be my only
My one and only
Is that the way it should start?

So dancing days are here again
As the summer evenings grow
You are my flower, you are my power
You are my woman who knows

I said it's alright
You know it's alright
You know it's all in my heart
You'll be my only, yes
My one and only, yes
Is that the way it should start?
I know it is, yeah!



On a long and lonesome highway, east of Omaha
You can listen to the engine moanin' out his one note song
You can think about the woman or the girl you knew the night before
But your thoughts will soon be wanderin' the way they always do
When you're ridin' sixteen hours and there's nothin' there to do
And you don't feel much like ridin', you just wish the trip was through

Here I am
On the road again
There I am
On the stage
Here I go
Playin' star again
There I go
Turn the page

Well you walk into a restaurant all strung out from the road
And you feel the eyes upon you as you're shakin' off the cold
You pretend it doesn't bother you but you just want to explode
Most times you can't hear 'em talk, other times you can
All the same old cliches, "Is it woman, is it man?"
And you always seem outnumbered so you don't dare make a stand
Oh, here I am
On the road again
There I am
On the stage, yeah
Here I go
Playin' star again
There I go
Turn the page

Out there in the spotlight you're a million miles away
Every ounce of energy you try to give away
As the sweat pours out your body like the music that you play
Later in the evening as you lie awake in bed
With the echoes from the amplifiers ringin' in your head
You smoke the day's last cigarette, rememberin' what she said

Here I am
On the road again
There I am
Up on the stage
Ah, here I go
Playin' star again
There I go
Turn the page
Here I am
On the road again
There I am
On the stage, yeah
Here I go
Playin' star again
There I go
There I go



Oh, whoa, whoa
Ow
Mm!
There she stood in the street
Smiling from her head to her feet
I said-ah, hey, what is this?
Now baby, maybe, maybe she's in need of a kiss
I said-ah, "Hey, what's your name baby?
Maybe we can see things the same
Now don't you wait or hesitate
Let's move before they raise the parking rate."
Ow!
All right now
Baby, it's-ah all right now
Mm!
All right now
Baby, it's-ah all right now
Whoa, ooh
Let me tell you all about it now
Mm!
I took her home to my place
Watching every move on her face
She said, "Look, what's your game, baby?
Are you tryin' to put me in shame?"
I said, "Slow, don't go so fast
Don't you think that love can last?"
She said, "Love, Lord above
Huh, now you're trying to trick me in love"
Ow!
All right now
Baby, it's-ah all right now
All right now
Baby, it's-ah all right now
Yeah, it's all right now
Yeah!
Hoo!
Oh yeah, ow!
Let me tell you all about it, now
Ow!
Yeah
Took her home, yeah, to my place
Watching every move on her face
She said, "Look, uh, what's your game?
Are you trying to put me in shame?"
"Baby," I said, "Slow, slow, don't go so fast, huh
Don't you think that love can last?"
She said, "Love, Lord above
Now he's trying to trick me in love"
Yeah!
All right now
Baby, it's-ah all right now, yeah
All right now
Baby, it's-ah all right now
All right now
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right
All right now
All right now
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right



Well, I built me a raft and she's ready for floating
Old Mississippi, she's calling my name
Catfish are jumping, that paddle wheel thumping
Black water keeps rolling on past just the same

Old black water, keep on rolling
Mississippi moon, won't you keep on shining on me?
Old black water, keep on rolling
Mississippi moon, won't you keep on shining on me?
Old black water, keep on rolling

And I ain't got no worries cause I ain't in no hurry at all
Well, if it rains, I don't care!
Don't make no difference to me
Just take that street car that's going up town
Yeah, I'd like to hear some funky Dixieland
And dance a honky tonk
And I'll be buying everybody drinks all round

Old black water, keep on rolling
Mississippi moon, won't you keep on shining on me?
Old black water, keep on rolling
Mississippi moon, won't you keep on shining on me?
Old black water, keep on rolling

Pretty mama, come and take me by the hand



I can't help about the shape I'm in
Can't sing, I ain't pretty and my legs are thin
But don't ask me what I think of you
I might not give the answer that you want me to
Oh, well

Now, when I talked to God, I knew He'd understand
He said, "Stick by my side and I'll be your guiding hand
Don't ask me what I think of you
I might not give the answer that you want me to"
Well

Oh, well, oh, well
Well, well, well, well



Busted flat in Baton Rouge, waiting for a train
When I was feeling nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down, just before it rained
And rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandana
I was playing soft while Bobby sung the blues, yeah
Windshield wipers slapping time I was holding Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew

Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose
Nothing, I mean nothing, honey if it isn't free, no no
Yeah feeling good was easy Lord, when he sang the blues
You know feeling good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee

From the Kentucky coal mines to the California sun
Yeah, Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, through everything we done
Yeah, Bobby baby kept me from the cold
One day up near Salinas, Lord, I let him slip away
He's lookin' for that home, and I hope he finds it
But I'd trade all of my tomorrows for one single yesterday
To be holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose
Nothing, and that's all that Bobby left me
Feeling good was easy Lord, when he sang the blues
You know feeling good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee

La da la la la, la da la la la da la
La da da la la la Bobby McGee yeah
La da la la la, la da la la la da la
La da da la la la Bobby McGee yeah
La da la la la, la da la la la da la
La da da la la la Bobby McGee yeah
La da la la la, la da la la la da la
La da da la la la Bobby McGee yeah

Lord, I called him my lover, I called him my man
I said called him my lover just the best I can and come on
And and a Bobby oh, and a Bobby McGee yeah
Lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo
Hey hey hey Bobby McGee, lord
La da la la la, la da la la la la la
Hey hey hey, Bobby McGee yeah



These niggas know the deal, it's easy to get killed
Wet that pussy up, see now you got the chills
Your bright idea shooting at me, the fuck yeah
Bright idea, 'til I blew out his light bulb
I'm more than a hip hop legend, I'm iconic
My sixteen is strong as fuck, I'm bionic
Apparently...you a parody of real nigga shit
Pop your forehead like a zit
I don't fuck with no snitches so I need to know who telling
And I need to know who they told on so I can fact check it
The alpha and omega, Mobb nigga I'm a fixture
Black culture, bougie niggas get they bitch took
Like bad bitches get they body shook
From Jamaica Ave. to the boulevard in Hollywood
From the projects, Nam and Oslo
Rocketman Elton John, call me P-iano

Yeah now I'm on my shit, got me on my shit
I'll hit a nigga with the clipper
And fade a nigga real quick, see
Keep me on my shit, wiling on that shit
I will ruin your life, I promise you that shit

Swedish features through the window of a Lincoln on the Bell swerving
I felt certain I was born to be the best Earthling
Felt worthless, so many Xs and circles
On my mother neck I know I serve a purpose
Smoke the same shit that turns a normal turtle to a ninja turtle
Neo-ninja doing ? on Myrtle
The motherfucker making a drug look like Urkel
Foreign shooters like Türkoğlu
740 with the curtain and set to 1020 degrees
Eyes closed switching speeds, hitting the weave
I shapeshift to a disease, attack your lung and cripple your knees
R&b chicks are twisted with ease, blitzkrieg
You still posing for your little-league pictures
I'm drinking beer straight out the pitcher
I'll put your moms in an armbar at the bar-mitzvah
Irish linen on the king
I'm guaranteed I'm gonna win another ring

I supercede that crap, now bitches want this hard shit
Niggas want this crack, them songs you got that's garbage
Paralyze your ears, stop talking, this P rapping
Been doing this for years, know money I keep racking, up
Come with it nigga, get beat the fuck, up
Next to me you're chuck meat
Yeah, we just committed suicide
With this swammi I get busy B; do or die
Big bar champion, the Henny and the rap flow
The great black shark, you just a little mackeral
My bitch appetite for power surpass yours
Now imagine my thoughts while I'm alone and you paused
That's 600 horses stomping on your neck strap
That's me, g-leaning with the pistol on my lap
Got a 3:00 your death, I could pencil you in
Ya'll niggas is chow, my gun fit to dig in



Tin soldiers and Nixon's comin'
We're finally on our own
This summer I hear the drummin'
Four dead in Ohio

Gotta get down to it
Soldiers are gunning us down

Sitting on a park bench
Eyeing little girls with bad intent
Snot running down his nose
Greasy fingers smearing shabby clothes
Hey, Aqualung
Drying in the cold sun
Watching as the frilly panties run
Hey, Aqualung
Feeling like a dead duck
Spitting out pieces of his broken luck
Whoa, Aqualung

Sun streaking cold, an old man wandering lonely
Taking time the only way he knows
Leg hurting bad as he bends to pick a dog-end
He goes down to the bog and warms his feet
Feeling alone, the army's up the road
Salvation a la mode and a cup of tea
Aqualung my friend, don't you start away uneasy
You poor old sod, you see, it's only me

Do you still remember
December's foggy freeze?
When the ice that
Clings on to your beard was
Screaming agony (Hey!)
And you snatch your rattling last breaths
With deep-sea-diver sounds
And the flowers bloom like
Madness in the spring
Sun streaking cold, an old man wandering lonely
Taking time the only way he knows
Leg hurting bad as he bends to pick a dog-end
He goes down to the bog and warms his feet
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Feeling alone, the army's up the road
Salvation a la mode and a cup of tea
Aqualung my friend, don't you start away uneasy
You poor old sod, you see, it's only me
Me-me-me-me-me
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh


Dee-dee-dee-dee
Dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee
Dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee
Dee-dee-dee-dee
Aqualung, my friend, don't you start away uneasy
You poor old sod, you see, it's only me

Sitting on a park bench
Eyeing little girls with bad intent
Snot running down his nose
Greasy fingers smearing shabby clothes
Hey, Aqualung
Drying in the cold sun
Watching as the frilly panties run
Hey, Aqualung
Feeling like a dead duck
Spitting out pieces of his broken luck
Hey, Aqualung

After all the jacks are in their boxes
And the clowns have all gone to bed
You can hear happiness staggering on down the street
Footprints dressed in red
And the wind whispers Mary

A broom is drearily sweeping
Up the broken pieces of yesterday's life
Somewhere a queen is weeping
Somewhere a king has no wife
And the wind it cries Mary

The traffic lights they turn blue tomorrow
And shine their emptiness down on my bed
The tiny island sags downstream
'Cause the life they lived is dead
And the wind screams Mary

Will the wind ever remember
The names it has blown in the past?
And with its crutch, its old age, and its wisdom
It whispers no, this will be the last
And the wind cries Mary



Home in the valley, home in the city
Home isn't pretty, ain't no home for me
Home in the darkness, home on the highway
Home isn't my way, home I'll never be

Burn out the day
Burn out the night
I can't see no reason to put up a fight
I'm livin' for givin' the devil his due

An' I'm burnin', I'm burnin', I'm burnin' for you
I'm burnin', I'm burnin', I'm burnin' for you!

Time is the essence, time is the season
Time ain't no reason, got no time to slow
Time everlasting, time to play B-sides
Time ain't on my side, time I'll never know

Burn out the day
Burn out the night
I'm not the one to tell you what's wrong and what's right
I've seen signs of what a prison their lives went through
And I'm burnin', I'm burnin', I'm burnin' for you
I'm burnin', I'm burnin', I'm burnin' for you!


Burn out the day
Burn out the night
I can't see no reason to put up a fight
I'm livin' for givin' the devil his due

An' I'm burnin', I'm burnin', I'm burnin' for you
I'm burnin', I'm burnin', I'm burnin' for you
I'm burnin', I'm burnin', I'm burnin' for you
I'm burnin', I'm burnin', I'm burnin' for you!



"The schools in a portion of Boston stretching from just south of South Boston through Roxbury and into Dorchester are districted with a similar effect: the predominantly black areas are cut away from the predominantly white areas."
Morgan v. Hennigan, U.S. District Court for Massachusetts, 1974
THE SEEK BUTTON on the Ford's radio is working. The downtown recedes. Miles of neighborhoods fill the windshield. The SEEK function locks on someplace in stereo, college FM probably. "Yeah," a new friend says, "Whas up. Whas goin on." The radio has another button, VOL, which gets jacked repeatedly while the Ford hurtles, happily, to the source of the noise. Not to the station's broadcast booth on a campus across the river, nor to its transmission towers in the suburbs, but rather to RJam Productions in North Dorchester, where black kids from Boston's now-integrated high schools-Latin, Madison Park, Jeremiah Burke, Mattapan-cut demos and dream of being bigger than even the radio's new friend, a young man named Schoolly D who right now, at speaker-damaging volume, sounds darn big. "Before we start this next record…," Schooly's saying. The record in question is called "Signifying Rapper," a brief, bloody tale of ghetto retribution from Side 2 of Schoolly's Smoke Some Kill.
The black areas are cut away from the white areas a federal judge ruled in '74, and evidence is everywhere that nothing's changed since then. On the southbound left of the Fitzgerald Expressway pass 20 blocks of grim Irish-Catholic housing projects, the western border of Belfast, complete with Sinn Fein graffiti and murals depicting a glorious United Ireland, a neighborhood where the gadfly will get his fibula busted for praising the '74 court order that bused "Them" from wherever it is "They" live-the Third World fer crissakes--into 97-percent-white South Boston. On the Expressway's right is the place the fibula-busters are talking about: the simultaneous northern border of Haiti, Jamaica and Georgia; a territory that maps of Boston call North Dorchester.
Uniting the two sides of the Expressway is just about nothing. Both neighborhoods are tough and poor. Both hate the college world across the river, which, because of Boston's rotten public schools, they will never see as freshmen. And kids from both neighborhoods can do this hating to the beat of undergraduate radio, which this fine morning features suburban kids with student debt broadcasting the art of a ghetto Philadelphian roughly their age, once much poorer than they, but now, on royalties from Smoke Some Kill, very much richer.
Not that the shared digging of black street music is news, or even new: twenty years ago, when Morgan v. Hennigan, Boston's own Brown v. Board of Education, was inching through the courts, and even dark-complected Italians were sometimes unwelcome in the Irish precincts east of the Expressway, kids in Boston's Little Belfast sang along with James Brown over the radio.
"Say it loud
I'm black and I'm proud
Say it loud
I'm black and I'm proud!"
Except that halfway through the infectious funk, the crewcuts realize what they're saying: Jesus christ, "I'm proud to be black" fer chrissakes, like when you're in the porno store, you know, and you get lost or something and you find yourself in the men's part, you know? not the part for men in the part that's about men, Jesus, and you get the hell outta there. And so they hum/mumble the suppressed parts.
"Say it loud
I'm mmm hum proud
Say it loud
Mum hum hum proud!"
But rap isn't funk, rock or jazz, and the vast crossover move, broadcasting "ghetto" music over college radios to ghettos of a different color, is no simple reenactment of past crossovers. How, for example, does the sing-along fan of Smoke Some Kill mumble his way through these lines:
"Black is beautiful
Brown is sick? slick? stiff?
Yellow's OK
But white ain't shit."
Rjam Productions, modestly headquartered in a mixed black/Hispanic Field, Corner section of North Dorchester, is as follows:
* One (1) four-car garage fitted with dubbing and remastering gear worth more than most of the rest of the real estate on the block;
* One (1) touch-tone telephone (leased);
* Two (2) Chevy Blazers, vanity-plated RJAM1 and RJAM2, each equipped with cellular phones and slick tape decks (also leased);
* One (1) VCR with Kathleen Turner's Body Heat cued up on the morning in question;
* Most importantly, eight (8) promising acts under binding contract
If, as has happened to many local labels, Rjam were liquidated to satisfy creditors, these would be the pieces. But there are stores of value in the converted garage beyond the reach of the auctioneer's gavel. Schoolly D, the original Signifying Rapper, looms irresistibly from the pages of rap "fanzines" Hip-Hop and The Source; and Rjam's prime, unauctionable asset is the consuming ambition of the artists in its stable to be the next Schoolly D. Or the next Ice T, or Kool Moe Dee, or L. L. Cool J., or whoever's the special hero of the kid cutting the demo. On this particular morning, the dream is to be the next MC Lyte--a hard-rapping woman known for jams like "MC Lyte vs. Vanna Whyte" and "10% Dis"--since today is Tam-Tam's day and Tam-Tam is, at 16, a tough girl in the MC Lyte mold who, like MC Lyte, can dance, look good, and tell men to beat it, all at once.
Or so claims Tam-Tam's producer, promoter, and dutch uncle, Gary Smith, who opened RJam on Martin Luther King's birthday, '89, with his older brother Nate. Nate, the elder statesman, is 25. Gary, 22, runs the company while Nate travels with his boyhood-friend-turned-boss, quadruple-platinum, Prince-derived rapper/singer, Bobby Brown. RJam was founded in part with an investment from the 23-year-old multi-millionaire Brown, a native of Roxbury. Brown now lives in Los Angeles.
Nate and Gary Smith turn a healthy profit making demos at $500/tape, but the brothers aren't in the health business. Their aim: to follow in the corporate footsteps of Def Jam, a once similarly tiny production company run from a basement in Hollis, Queens, which since its basement days, has given America Public Enemy, L. L. Cool J., the Beastie Boys, and much of the rest of that culture-quake called rap. Gary Smith doesn't compare RJam to Def Jam, and, unlike Def Jam's Russell Simmons, Gary produces pop, soul, and R&B as well as straight rap, and actually prefers R&B. But how many sophomores at nearby Jeremiah Burke can afford to dream in R&B, to front music lessons and $500 for an nth-hand sound set-up, find three friends to learn drums, bass and keyboards, and then raise another $500 to make a demo at RJam? Anybody with a larynx can rap, however, and Rjam's brisk business in rap demos pays the taxman, Boston Edison and the Chevrolet Motor Credit Corp.
Twenty minutes farther south on the Fitzgerald Expressway, across the Neponset River and into the pricey suburbs, is the scene of John Cheever's boyhood, more recently celebrated as Massachusetts Miracle country, where technology ventures are started at the rate of five per week, four of which will fail within 12 months. RJam's Gary Smith is secret brother to the men of the suburban Chambers of Commerce, sharing their worries about cash flow, overhead, and the enforceability of his contracts; but Gary's world and theirs are as far apart as those of Ward and Eldridge Cleaver. Worriers in suburbia fear that ballooning property values will hike taxes on computer executives' seaside homes. In Gary's neighborhood, property values are actually falling.
Waiting less than patiently for Tam-Tam, Gary honks twice. A tall, grave girl with an angel's heart-shaped face crosses the ghetto street and climbs into the back seat of RJAM1. She has, apparently, at least two voices, the cynical, sexy rant heard on tape this morning telling Pebbles men ain't worth it, and the whisper in which she now says hello.
As RJAM1 re-crosses North Dorchester, heading back to the soundproof studios to get the day's work started, Gary and DJ Reese hash out production details. Tam-Tam's a dignified island in the back seat, and a shiver accompanies the thought that this could be the Motor City in '63 with Berry Gordy and an eighty-pound teenage Diana Ross, just voted Best Dressed at Cass Technical High School, driving crosstown to record a little number called "Where Did Our Love Go."
Ask Tam-Tam about Diana Ross, and she gives a beatific smile. She's 16; she can remember only with difficulty the first rap she ever listened to, when rap was new and she was 8; Run-DMC or somebody, she mumbles in response to what suddenly seems a foolish question about her influences. Like most of rap's black audience (as distinct from rap's white audience, which is usually a decade older), Tam-Tam has no first-hand recollection of James Brown except as a source for rap. She is too young to have attended segregated schools. She was in diapers during the violent first few months of desegregation in Boston and can't remember the awful day in '74 when "pro-neighborhood" marchers from Irish South Boston came upon a black pedestrian at City Hall and beat him with pole-mounted American flags.
Tam-Tam has star presence, and like many who do, she seems to see very little of what goes on around her, the price of the star's intense focus on self. She reminds you of Senator Gary Hart. He, too, had star presence. In front of a crowd, Hart was riveting; in the elevator riding up to the auditorium, he was barely there. Being barely there in the neighborhood Tam-Tam calls home is probably not such a bad thing, and perhaps her drive to be star someday is an elaborate way to wall out the now and here. Ambition is, finally, a form of hope, a scarce commodity in North Dorchester.
Back in Rjam's control booth, Dj Reese and producer Ralph Stacey are programming the rhythm track for what will be "Ho, You're Guilty." Drum parts are taken from a Roland TR-909 Rhythm Composer, a synth which electronically reproduces programmed beats on the user's choice of drum-matrix. The TR-909's keys, on a console designed to resemble, vaguely, the familiar piano, are named after the sound each creates-bass, snare, mid-tom, hi-tom--and the sounds are named after the actual drums which, until the TR-909, were required to make those sounds. The TR-909 even sports a key named HAND CLAP, making it possible for the first time ever to clap hands with a single finger, rendering obsolete the Zen koan about the sound of one hand clapping. The finished "Ho, You're Guilty" will sound lush with percussion, melody, and instrumental breaks. Not one human musician will be employed in the recording process.
Each percussion line is programmed onto the mixing board as a separate track: a snare track, a bass track, a clap track, etc. Reese has been studying the classics lately, too, viz: James Brown's Dead on the Heavy Funk from '75ish, including the ageless groove, "Funky President," in which James announces his third-party candidacy. Some of Bobby Byrd's Dead guitar, and a holy moment when James exhales rhythmically, have been isolated from a store-bought cassette of Dead, re-recorded on clean tape, then re-re-recorded onto a computer-readable memory diskette from which the sample is retrieved and altered by Ralph Stacey using a Roland D-50 linear synth. The guitar and the exhalation then go, as altered, from the synth to yet another of the 24 tracks on the big mixing board. Reese, the DJ, will weave a seamless rhythm track out of these 24 strands.
As Reese and Ralph Stacey mix the 24 tracks onto one master tape, Tam-Tam sips lemonade in the corner of the booth. You ask her if she is interested someday in learning about the obscure digital technology the two men manipulate on her behalf. She doesn't seem to register the question. "The other career besides rap I'd like to pursue is modelling," she says. "I'm five-seven. That's the perfect height for a model."
Mixing takes the rest of the day. Producer Ralph Stacey at one late point corners you with a flinty stare and an uncomfortable question: "Why do you want to write about rap, anyway?" It is lucky that at that minute Reese is done mixing. Tomorrow the RJam staff will tape Tam-Tam's vocal track and lay this over Reese's rhythm track. Then the sound will be "fattened" with stacks of horns, guitar hooks, bells, canned applause, and whatever else they decide to take from other tapes or work up on the Rolands. The final demo tape of "Ho, You're Guilty" will then be shopped to the 20 major, minor, and tiny labels who might release the demo as a 12-inch single.
Everyone's ready to call it a day. Gary Smith's already huddled with some new wanna-be stars in RJam's reception area. Reese plays the mixed rhythm track once through over the big speakers in the control booth, and Tam-Tam immediately stands, modelling forgotten, utterly alert. Reese gestures to her with maestro hands. She raps at an absent Antoinette in the hard, sexy voice you haven't heard since this morning, extemporaneous but on beat:
"I'm a female
You're just a fairytale."
The small-w we here are two white Boston males: one native, one oft-transplanted; both residing in Somerbridge, a dim, ethnic-Portuguese neighborhood whose gentrification we abet. M. is an attorney with a taste for jazz, Blues, funk; D. a grad student and would-be drifter who watches TV instead of sleeping. Our cultural tastes and interests are day and night. They converged only lately, when D's stereo arrived UPS and we discovered we shared an uncomfortable, somewhat furtive, and distinctively white enthusiasm for a certain music called rap/hip-hop.* About our passions and discomforts we could determine only that they were vague & distinct contexts and cathexes brought to bear across the same ethnic distance on the same thing. For instance, we agreed that real or serious rap is not JJ FAD or Tone Loc or Beasties, Egyptian Lover or Fat Boys, not experiments or freakshows or current commercial crossover slush. "Serious" rap--a unique U.S. inner-city fusion of funk, technified reggae, teen-to-teen "hardcore" rock, and the early 70s "poetry of the black experience" of Nikki Giavonni, the Last Poets, etc.--has, since its late-70s delivery at the record-scratching hands of Afrika Bambaataa and his Zulu Nation, Sugarhill Gang, Kool Herc and his automated Herculords, and Grandmaster Flash, always had its real roots in the Neighborhood, the black gang-banger Underground. Black music, of and for blacks.
We concurred as to the wheres and whens of rap's begetting--mid-to-late 70s' South Bronx house parties; then, by decade's end, block parties, with municipal electric lights tapped for a power source, literal dancing in the streets; by '82, regular rap-houses and then "floating clubs"--the Roxy every Sunday, The Bronx's Disco Fever TWTh--everybody Breaking to a new musical antimusic being fashioned from records and turntables and an amateur DJs ad-lib banter; a very heavy reggae influence at the beginning; the more rhythmic pure rap an offshoot, its brisker, sparer, backbeat designed for Breakdance, and the smooth-rapping partygoer who just didn't want to shut up when others' music was on. We agreed, too, on rough chronology: amateur house-partiers giving way to professional DJs, pioneers; they, too, then overshadowed by new art-entrepreneurs, former Breakers, failed singers, gag-majorettes; then the rise of "Indies," the tiny independent labels that keep most new music on life-support--Sugar Hill, Jive, Tommy Boy, Wild Pitch, Profile Records, Enjoy--then, after King Tim III's "Personality Jock" and Sugarhill Gang's "Rapper's Delight," an entree into urban black radio; then to underground "Mix" radio; then corporate levels, digital technology, very big money, the early-80s talent that became an early Scene's cream--Spoonie G. and Sequence, Eric Fresh, Unknown DJ, Egyptian Lover and Run-DMC. Then, Spring '84, the extraordinary Midas touch of Rick Rubin and Russell Simmons' Def Jam label (now under contract to CBS) from which sprang a mid-80s stable of true stars, in the Underground--Public Enemy, L. L. Cool J, Slick Rick, the still-unparalleled Eric B. and Rakim--and L.A.'s alternatives: Kool Moe Dee, L.A. Dream Team, and others. And now, at decade's end, an absolute explosion of rap-as-pop, big business, MTV, special fashions, posters, merchandise, with only a few big, new, cutting-edge acts--L.A.'s N.W.A., Philadelphia's Schoolly D, Miami's 2 Live Crew, De La Soul's House-blend of rap/funk/jazz--remaining too esoteric or threatening or downright obscene to cross all the way over and cash in with big labels. By '89 rap is finally proving as "important" (read also lucrative) to an anemic shock-and rebellion-music industry as Punk was an exact decade ago. This was all just data. We agreed on it, and on how it was curious that we both had such strange, distant facts down cold.
Our point of departure, essay-wise, was always less what we know than what we felt, listening: less what we liked than why. For this attempt at an outside sampler we plunked down and listened to thousands of hours of rap, trying to summon a kind of objective, critical, purely "aesthetic" passion that the music itself made impossible. For outsiders, rap's easy to move to, hard to dissect. The more we listened and thought and drank beers and argued, the more we felt that the stuff's appeal for two highbrow, upscale whites was just plain incongruous. Because serious rap has, right from the start, presented itself as a closed show. Usually critical questions of culture, context, background and audience reduce quickly to vexed questions about prepositions. Not here. No question that serious rap is, and is very self-consciously, music by urban blacks about same to and for same. To mainstream whites it's a tight cohesion that can't but look, from outside the cultural window, like occlusion, clannishness (sic) and inbreeding, a kind of reverse snobbery about what's "def" and "fresh" and in-the-Scene that eerily recalls the exclusionary codes of college Societies and WASP-only country clubs. Serious rap is a musical movement that seems to revile whites as a group or Establishment, and simply to ignore their possibility as distinct individuals--the Great White Male is rap's Grand Inquisitor, its idiot questioner--its Alien Other no less than Reds were for McCarthy. The music's paranoia, together with its hermetic racial context, helps explain why from the outside it appears to us just as vibrant and impassioned as it does alien and scary.
Other incongruities. Rap is a "music" essentially without melody, built instead around a digitally synthesized drum- and back-beat often about as complex as five idle fingers on a waiting-room table, enhanced by "sampled" (pirated) "krush grooves" (licks or repetitive chord-series) conceived and recorded by pre-rap rock icons, the whole affair characterized by a distinctive, spare, noisy, clattering "style" whose obsessive if limited thematics revolve with the speed of low-I amperage around the performative circuit of the MC/rapper and his record-scratching, sound-mixing Sancho Panza, the DJ.
The rapper (the guy in the cameo cut or Kangol hat, pricey warm-up, unlaced Adidas, extra thick gold chain or oversized medallion) offers lyrics that are spoken or bellowed in straight, stressed, rhymed verse, the verse's syntax and meter often tortured for rhythmic gain or the kind of limboing-for-rhyme we tend to associate with doggerel about men from Nantucket. The lyrics, nearly always self-referential, tend to be variations on about half a dozen basic themes, themes that at first listen can seem less alien or shocking than downright dull. Eg: just how bad/cool/fresh/def the rapper and his lyrics are; just how equally un-all-these his music rivals are; how troublesome, vacuous and acquisitive women are; how wonderful it is to be "paid in full" for rapping instead of stealing or dealing; how gangs are really families, 'caine's constant bad news. And, in particular, how sex and violence and yuppie toys represent perfectly the urban black lifedrive to late-80s American glory.
The masks are many, too many for anything really but direct aural inspection: rap personae can change frequently even within single albums, the rapper delivering Hard, violent Black Nationalist communique on one cut, dubbing against Trinidadian steel drums on another, basking in big label eclat on a third, cracking a head and then defly outwitting someone muscled and dumb, cooing to his "bitch" and then on the flip side, threatening to go get his gun again if she can't learn who's boss. Though any crew naturally wants its own distinctive game and face, the quintessential rap group is unquintessential, chameleonesque. This is either by weird design, or it's a symptom and symbol of 80s facelessness…or most likely, it's just a good old venerable synecdoche of rap's genre itself, one that's now moving so fast it can't quite fix on its own identity -- much less hold still for anything like cool, critical classification or assessment, from outside.
The MC's Alice Toklas-esque DJ hovers ever nearby over his buffet of connected turntables and the black Germanness of a whole lot of digital editing & playback equipment. His responsibility is the song behind and around the rap -- the backbeat, krush groove, and the "sound carpet," i.e. a kind of electric aural environment, a chaos behind the rapper's rhymed order, a digitalized blend of snippets, squeaks, screams, sirens, snatches from pop media, all mixed and splattered so that the listener cannot really listen but only feel the resultant mash of "samples" that results. The most recognizable of these samples range from staccato record-scratches to James Brown and Funkadelic licks, to M.L.K.'s public Dream, to quotidian pop pap like "The Theme from Shaft," Brady Bunch dialogue, and '50s detergent commercials.
We have now read every review and essay to do with serious underground hip-hop available in every single on-line periodical ... xcept for one or two underground newsletters (viz. The City Sun, Fresh-Est) circulated in parts of the Bronx demimonde where learning about rap is as hard for white outsiders as scoring fine China White or AKs. From the kind of sedulous bibliomaniacal research to be expected of conscientious lawyers and PhDs, the following has become clear. Outside England, where the Punk-weaned audience has developed a taste for spectacle-through-windows, for vicarious Rage and Protest against circumstances that have exactly 0% to do with them, most of what Rolling Stone calls "devoted rock consumers" (meaning we post-baby-boomers), plus almost all established rock critics, tend to regard non-crossover rap as essentially boring and simplistic, or swaggering and bellicose and dangerous--at all events, basically vapid and empty because of its obsessive self-referentiality…in short, as closed to them, to us, as a music. Unrecognizable as what we've been trained and adverted to buy as pop.... Great to dance to, of course, but then what might the white audience for today's mainstream expect? Rap, whether fecund or sterile, is today's pop music's lone cutting edge, the new, the unfamiliar, the brain-resisted-while-body-boogies. And that resisted, alien, exhilarating cutting edge has always been black.
"What have you left me? what have I got?
Last night in cold blood my young brother got shot
My homey got jacked
My mother's on crack
My sister can't work cause her arms show tracks
Madness, insanity
Live in profanity
Then some punk claim that they understandin' me?
Give me a break--what world do you live in?
Death is my sex--guess my religion."**
What makes this stuff so much more disturbing, more real to outsiders than the Punk Rock even those of us who remember it could never quite take seriously? Maybe even a closed music has to have some kind of detente with received custom: I always found it tough to listen straight-faced to a nihilist lecture from someone with a chartreuse mohawk and an earring in his eyelid who punctuates his delivery with vomit and spit. All doctrine and pronouncement, exclusively anti-, this Punk of a decade past afforded even willing mainstream listeners no easement across cultural void, nothing human to grab onto. I have no idea what a Punk performer thinks, feels, is, day-to-day... in fact I always suspected he had no day, but just retreated to his plush coffin at cockcrow. Can you imagine a Punk with four-foot hair and spiked jacket and nose-ring, say, eating a bologna sandwich? Replacing a light bulb? Putting a quarter in a meter? Not me, boy. And even Barnum, who knew fear sells, also knew that freakshows aren't frightening when the freakishness supplants all resemblance. 0% affinity = 0% empathy. And fear requires empathy as much as it does menace or threat.
Public Enemy and N.W.A., Ice T and Schoolly D discomfit us, our friends, the critics we read and cornered, because the Hard rappers' lyrics are conscientious about being of/for the real lives and attitudes of recognizable, if alien, persons. Here's where it's a level up from mere spectacle: ideology in Hard rap is always informed by incident or named condition. This makes rap not only better than Punk, but way scarier. Serious Hard raps afford white listeners genuine, horse's-mouth access to the life-and-death plight and mood of an American community on the genuine edge of im-/explosion, an ugly new sub-nation we've been heretofore conditioned to avoid, remand to the margins, not even see except through certain carefully abstract, attenuating filters.
For outsiders, rap is hard to dissect, easy to move to. The command is: dance, don't understand; participate, don't manipulate. Rap is a fortress protected by the twin moats of talk and technology. The first is that nu style of speak--the "dialect drug," De La Soul calls it--that rappers fashion from jive and disseminate through record stores to all of us. Some in-words, like "fly," meaning "finelooking," have been in coin since the beginning, now venerable as Old English because they turn up on Grandmaster Flash cuts from '82. Others, like "dead presidents," rap for $$, are either coming into or going out of currency, depending on when you read this. Rap, a club language, has myriad ways to describe one's own or others' looks. "Fly" is how a man digs a woman. One would never describe oneself as "fly," even when cataloguing one's own attractions (done more in rap than anyplace except perhaps Village Voice personals). "Fresh" means irresistibly stylish, oft-modified by "funky," "crazy," or "stoopid," predominantly used to convey the fly-ness of things other than women, including oneself or one's rap, which two concepts rappers, like schizophrenics, can't always keep separate in their heads. "Dope" means "def," and "def" means crazy funky stoopid fresh. Synonyms include: the shit, the It, the cool, the thang, the word, the grooviest, the categorical imperative, die weltanschung, the that-which-Potter-Stewart-would-know-if-he-saw. A def rapper is so style-defining as to make the stylish mere copycats. To be def is to rap to the beat of a different drum machine--not seeking solitude, but rather confident that others will follow. The def rapper MC's a def rap, which rap def-ly tells of its own (and the rapper's) def-ness--so def, as MC/manager, entrepreneur Russell Rush Simmons brags, that it had to be on a label called Def Jam.
Rap celebrates power, equating strength with style, and style with the "I" in "Individuality." Rappers "dis"--dismiss--the styleless, faceless. To "ill" is to be weak or wrong; to "bite" is to thieve another's dope beat. And only the ill would bite.
Early remastered pop was the first fake music ever, since what the record buyer of '63 experienced as Aural Event on his turntable couldn't happen live. Rock began to become an Illusion of Event which technology made possible; rock became more like the movies, starting down a long road at the end of which was MTV.
Not that this kept Phil Spector up nights. The gurus of the studio had fatter fish to clean, for the new freedom to shape sound had come at a price. With each magnetic jump from live, as tape was made of tapes which were themselves tapes of tapes, the hiss and crackle of interference multiplied. Dual high-bias media with 2 units each of sonic garbage per 10,000 units of Elvis Presley, retaped on similar 2-units-per-10,000 tape, became 4 units of hiss; retaped, 8; then 16; then 32. As the sound got fuller, it decayed.
The solution was a breakthrough called multi-tracking--using recorders that could capture and play back on 2 (as in stereo), 4 (as in '67's then-ear-shattering Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band), 12, 16, and today 24 parallel tracks, eliminating the hiss of transference from one machine to the next. Rhythms, melodies, harmonies could all be captured on separate tracks, allowing the performer or producer to mix and listen and re-mix, adding vocals or lead instrument on yet another track. Rap Edisons like Kool Herc, Grandmaster Flash and Afrika Bambaataa began as party DJs, not musicians. Their wiring of twin turntables to a mixer, allowing them to "stack" the sound of two different records while rapping into a mike, was a kind of crude, extemporaneous multitracking. Technological loops like those in the NASA-esque studios of CBS and Polygram were now in the hands of the homeboys. Carter was President. The Bee Gees, with five Top-Ten hits in twelve months, were king.
Digital recording, the science dividing Rjam's Tam-Tam on tape from Tam-Tam as heard "live" is a technology that converts music to codes or "digits." The codes are "read" by a computer, one combining sophisticated sound-to-code translation hardware with a number-crunching COS and a high-response synthesizer, at speeds of 40,000 digits per second and up. The recorded sounds, reduced to numbers, can be shaped, mangled, muffled, amplified, and even canonized.*** Hardware then translates the digits, as read and altered, back into sound, which can itself be recorded on multitrack and combined with yet more sounds. The result: hiss-free reproduction on an infinity of tracks, each of which can itself be manipulated infinitely.
Digital recording, part of the 80s sea-change in how pop gets made, divides the responsibility for the final song more or less equally between the performer, the engineer at the mixing board, the producer who coordinates the multi-tracking and mixing process, and the electronic hardware that actually "makes" the music we buy. The latest synthesizers**** produce notes from pure electric current instead of electronically amplified vibrations, with voltage-meters rather than hands or feet determining everything from key to pitch to timbre to "attack-delay envelope" (another non-rap term, denoting the microtimed, counterpoised quality of a note's duration, how a note's sound/quaver-structure as it builds is different from its sound and structure as it fades--the manipulation of a piano's foot-pedals, for example, affects the delay component of each note and chord's envelope). The Kurzweil 250, a state-of-the-art system, is a 1-?track/12,018-note synthesizer linked by software to an Apple MacIntosh Plus, which serves as an exhaustive library of digitized sound. The Kurzweil could put all of culture in a blender--take Janet Leigh's Cremora-curdling scream from Psycho, store it in the Mac, program the synth such that an F# will be reproduced as Janet Leigh's F# scream, then play "We Shall Overcome" as if screamed by Janet Leigh; store this; treat similarly Bach's St. Matthew's Passion, except with vast choruses of screaming Janet Leighs, then "Mary Had a Little Lamb," then "Twist and Shout" (by the Isleys, not the Beatles), all as screams; then replay the four as one horrific jumble, or select amidst the jumble; and then whatever you came up with in the final, painstakingly re-mixed mix you could play backwards. And call that "finished." Or never finish. It's like holding music at gunpoint. You can make it do--or do to you --whatever you can think of. Whim is the only limit.
Basically we decided we were into rap because, even media-hype aside, this music had some kind of hard edge to it. Date of composition here is July '89. Think back. This last has been a fiscal year in which Madonna's "back on top," in which covers of classic covers of classic tunes are themselves covered and then climb corporate charts, in which Rod Stewart's out of cryogenics and back on top.... MTV's ceased to be anything but a long commercial for itself and the interests of corporate labels; Bobby McFerrin makes a platinum mint and then several commercial jingles out of a burbled synth-reggae invitation to "Be Happy," a song that has the same verbal-pre-packaging feel as "Where's the Beef?"
This last year heavy metal's fake-Satanist male models accounted for 1/2 of total U.S. record sales; U2 filmed a $20,000,000 homage to their own self-righteousness and Bono's ever more ill-disguised megalomania. A year when even good old REM finally went corporate-pop with Green, when good old Springsteen trashed his bride, when as modest and nascent a talent as Tracy Chapman earned cymbal-crashing critical raves for her competent, updated frappe of Baez and Armatrading, so desperate were pop critics and consumers for any voice at once comprehensible and even remotely fresh. Just not a notable pop year at all. Except in rap. Rap appears in the famished late 80s as potentially a genuine musical Scene the way early jazz, rock, the Summer of Love, folk/protest, god even the way New Wave and Punk were "Scenes"--the S-word here simultaneously meaning: something new to look at; something loud and upsetting ("Oh please, Veronica, let's not have a Scene!"); and, best, an identifiable set of places in time where large forces meet, marry and beget. Whether by virtue or default, rap is pretty much what there is to like right now, if you want to regard today's pop as anything more than covert jingles in 4/4-time. In our opinion.
But so the point is we enjoy it. Plus we've developed some theses about why serious rap is important, both as art-for-own-sake and as a kind of metaphor-with-larynx for a subbed-culture unique in its distillation of the energy and horror of the American present.
Rap is expanding gas-like through the 80s' dry time, growing from house party schtick, gang anthem, a small-label fad with the sort of pop lifespan you measure with eggtimers--then somehow, when we weren't looking, into Scene, movement, On The Air--finally, in the last 24 months, assuming the fecund role of genuine Genre. Exploding into subspecies now faster than you can track. There's now Dub's mix of rap and reggae, House's mix of rap and 70s-, huge-afro'd funk, Acid House's psychedelic hip-hop. There is black rap for white mass-consumption (Tone Loc, Run?DMC), black rap for local set and -house consumption (countless local stars and wanna-be's in every large city), ultra-black rap superstars for the whole marginal Nation inside (Heavy D, Public Enemy, Big Daddy Kane), white rap for white masses (the execrable Beastie Boys). There is Hispanic, Salsa-influenced rap out of different West Coast barrios, rap fused with West Indian or Islamic traditional music in Digital Underground, Eric B. and Rakim, and others, or fused with oh-so-danceable R&B in the new "jack swing" offshoot (Bobby Brown, MC Hammer); even gay and bohemian young urban Bs have their trendsetters in Teddy Riley and Guy, De La Soul, Kwabe. Etc. etc.***** A major impediment to sampling this Scene is the kaleidoscopic fury with which the Scene itself is changing. If you're reading this in print it's already dated.
And the rap world's vitality is one of replacement as well as variety, allowing the genre to remain fresh, as band after band is seduced into the "real" music biz. This Scene is hydra-like. Almost the moment a rap artist like Run-DMC or L. L. Cool J "breaks through" into major-market mix appeal, MTV's land of corporate bankability, certain reactions within the urban underground that spawned them can almost always be observed. The breakthrough band's B-boys themselves are without qualms about the pop bigtime: after all, they've been rapping all along about their entitlement to money and status, about the inevitable rewards of their freshness and unbiteable voice. Their postbreakthrough raps tend all often to become celebrations of their new wealth and fame, of the now-enhanced authority of their "Message"--though it's hard to feature Public Enemy rapping about a Black-Militant renaissance, about revolution and American apocalypse, while lily-white CBS Records pays them millions for the distribution rights to just such exhortations to cut corporate throats.
Nevertheless, back in the underground Scene, the breakthrough band's tight set of original fans tends to hang loyal, to await feverishly "their" crew's spots on the same music TV they love to dis. In short, there are comparatively few of the accusations of selling out that accompanied a similarly oxymoronic coopting phenomenon in late-60s protest rock. Which if you think about it, is passing strange. The white mainstream Other against which serious rap aligns and defines itself makes the 60s "Establishment" too look downright benign.
Our opinion, then, from a distance: not only is a serious rap serious poetry, but, in terms of the size of its audience, its potency in the Great 80s Market, its power to spur and to authorize the artistic endeavor of a discouraged and malschooled young urban culture we've been encouraged sadly to write off,6 it's quite possibly the most important stuff happening in American poetry today. "Real" (viz. academic) U.S. poetry, a world no less insular than rap, no less strange or stringent about vocab, manner, and the contexts it works off, has today become so inbred and (against its professed wishes) inaccessible that it just doesn't get to share its creative products with more than a couple thousand fanatical, sandal-shod readers, doesn't get to move or inform more than a fraction of that readership (most of the moved being poets themselves), doesn't generate revenue for much of anyone save the universities to whom the best PhD-poets rent their names and time ... and especially does not inspire a whole culture's youth to try to follow in their Connecticut-catalogue brogans' prints. Because of rap's meteoric rise, though, you've got poor kids, tough kids, "underachievers," a "lost generation"... more young people--ostensibly forever turned off "language" by TV, video games and low U.S.D.E. budgets--more of these kids hunched over notebooks on their own time, trying to put words together in striking and creative ways, than the U.S.A. has probably ever had at one time. That few of these will become "stars" matters far less than the grim stats about, say, the tiny percentage of playground basketball phenoms who actually ride sports out and up from subclass status: the same verbal skills and enthusiasms rap values (and values enough to let rap-dissing stand symbolically for fighting or killing) can obviously be applied in mainstream-approved, "productive" ways--G.E.D.'s college, Standard Written English ...perhaps someday even ad-copywriting!
But is this wildfire of urban rap ambition raging around converted four-car garages like North Dorchester's RJam's in spite of the genre's near-disciplinary prosodic restrictions, or because of them? Can't really tell. Probably doesn't matter. The fact remains that, were "important poetry" presently defined in terms of what makes important art important in a Supply-Side democracy (popularity, effect, the separation of fan from his cash), staid journals like Poetry and American Poetry Review would be featuring some number of fade-cut, multiple-earring'd authors' photos in each issue; and highbrow public readings would always carry their back row fraction of bangers ready to "listen rude" to Wilbur and Levertov and Ashbery, just as e.g Rimbaud and Pound did to their own contemporaries ... to the delight and invigoration of a time's poetry...
... And even just the prospected fantasy of seeing Public Enemy's be-clocked Flavor Fav and like a Jorie Graham or Amy Clampitt sitting down over beer and Celestial Seasonings to hash out the debate over line-breaks in dactylic pentameter, a very serious young homeboy in Italian silk and pentagonal shades serving as interpreter is enough to make us hereby officially lobby for the admission of rhyme's renaissance--at least under the stringent rhythmic demands rap has forced on rhyme-as-form--to the cold corridors of Serious Appreciation.
Unlike the mostly docile poetry and fiction of the late 80s, though, rap's own quality, the def freshness of the MC's bit, is set up to be judged primarily in the context of what it is against. In case you thought we forgot, rap is first of all a movement in rock music, and thus the time-honored requirement is that the rap Scene set itself very consciously athwart those circumstances and forces whose enormity is required by all rock 'n roll to justify one of its essential roles, rebellion-against. Except now watch the objects of the rebellion alter, spread, grow in urgency--from the 50s' parents and principals, homework, hot rods, the sweet hurt of teen love, to the urban 80s, police, violent death, homelessness, the lure of ecstatic drugs that dehumanize weaponry, fatherlessness, the animal emptiness of sex w/o love, the almost Trilaterally sinister White Establishment ("THE GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSIBLE THE GOVERNMENT'S. . . "), Everyone Else: life as a series of interruptions from an angry slumber about what the electric voices say you must have and the human voices say you may not, about the betrayal of the past, of the promises exacted by Carmichael, X, and the now-formal martyrdom of King.
Segregation may affect their hearts and minds, Earl Warren warned, as Malcolm X and Louis Farrakhan, both alumni of Boston's old separate-but-awful schools, bear loud witness. Now, 40 years after X disgustedly quit a racist high school and began a career as a kind of be-bop gang-banger, 35 years after Brown v. Board of Education invented integration, 15 years after Morgan v. Hennigan brought Brown to Boston, North Dorchester is worse and its schools aren't better. A former United States Secretary of Education converts to Drug Czar, symbolizing a national change of mind: now drugs, not poor schools (and certainly not the American apartheid of which segregated schools were but one facet), is our root "innercity" problem. Tam-Tam's Boston is strangely less hopeful than the notoriously segregated pre-Hennigan city, perhaps because before Hennigan reformers could promise that segregation was why things were so bad. Segregation was blame's bullseye: abolish the bullseye, and blame for the estrangement of the races flies everywhere, hitting the cops, or the courts, or the teachers, or the taught, or what's taught. There's even a rap--B.D.P.'s "Why is That?"--blaming our miseries on the failure of the schools to "teach black kids to be black."
But everything the white rock listener pays to enjoy is black-begotten. If today's Top?40 environment seems bleak or befouled, imagine the present mainstream without its sweetest sourcewaters, without the King-Waters-King Blues trinity, the Brownian soul, the backbeat, cut time, blue notes, funky French curves of sax and brass, the guitar solo, call-and-response, the Cold Medina or Lucky Powder, those lithely syncopated quintets in pomade and linen suits, the single hand in the white glove holding Pepsi aloft in the shadow of accidental flames.... Black music is American pop's breath and bread; and we, as both born audience and born salesmen, know it.
So maybe it's them. Them. Maybe we're approaching an enforced fork in the musical road where the white-run entertainment industry will have to pack up what it's taken and go seek its fortune on the backs of new minorities. Maybe, in serious rap, the extreme new insulation of the black sound is not only intentional but preplanned, part of a neo-Nationalist agenda, the hermetic new Scene's tight circle more like something large and coiled than something small and flat.
You may now be getting some hazy idea of the sorts of really quite scary possibilities with which the rap we like is replete. And, hazier, of how complicated this stuff of sampler-from-outside can be. What's remained passing strange, for use, is the vague threat's appeal. The unease and ambivalence with which the rare white at the window loves rap renders that love no less love. Whence the fear, though, is really no matter. For look at the world, at the masses we're part of. At what you look at closest. The plain 80s data is that, whereas love, devotion, passion seem only to divide, it's fear and strangeness that bind crowds, fill halls, unite Us, somehow, as audience, under the great tent.
*'Hip-hop' is an older synonym, coined by Rap pioneer, Kool Herc, to describe the heavily danceable Jamaican scatting he introduced between records at the huge South Bronx block parties he and other new-Scene celebrities, like Jazzy Five and former Black Spades leader, Afrika Bambaataa, could turn into late-70s frenzies of Breakdance (both music and dance a self-conscious reaction against the glittered unreality of downtown Disco).
**Except but now hey kids! thanks to AT&T you can now speak directly to Ice T and hear his philosophy of life by phone! 1-900-907-9111. "Chill out with Ice T," the rapper adrape in military hardware and ammunition says on MTV, "I'm just waiting on you to call me," pointing at the camera and then himself lest the audience get at all confused. "Don't forget to ask your parent's permission first" (white corporate voice-over)--$2.00 first minute, etc. etc.
***"Canon" being another non-jive rap term, meaning the division of a single sequence of sound into two or more repeating sound-sequences, like a vocal round.
**** ... themselves the heirs of a long, 20th-century evolutionary process, from the playe-?piano to the 20s Oncles Martenot and Theremin and Trautonium (crude electronic instruments big in France), to Pierre Schaeffer's musique concrete in '48, to the first Electronic Music Synthesizer invented by engineers at RCA in the 50s to the inauguration of the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center in '59, to Robert Moog's '64 development of the Moog 55, the first emitter of amplified "blurps, fwipps, simps, twings, and schlonks" to be commercially produceable. Walter/Wendy Carlos used a Moog 55 for his/her '68 Switched-On Bach, an album that did more than anything to popularize synthesized sound.
***** Note how the ecstatic force's movement extends beyond sound into dance-Chicago-based house-dancing is very different from Coast-based rap-dancing, while both are distinct from the Quaalude sway a De La Soul's lazy complexity invites--and beyond dance into urban haute couture itself. The "cameo" or "fade," that troubling cyberpunk flat-top haircut favored by Carl Lewis and Grace Jones but popularized by the group Cameo's rapping Larry Blackmon, has now become less a haircut than a sculptural statement: words, logos, slogans and complex signs razored into the rigid anvil of hair that is, according to the Voice, "the most culturally conscious unisex hairstyle since the afro." The standard 80s-rap uniform--sideways baseball cap or Kangol, ropey chains, acetate warmup and unlaced hightops--"...now symbolizes a cruder, more casual era," and is diffracting into a rap-House-gay-jackswing look replete with polka-dot ties, loose pleated twills, and expensive dance-loafers or British "moon boots," a combination Ricky Ricardo-Frank Sinatra dapper that now befits a Scene with the dignity, silliness and pull of real Genre. Plus don't forget that just one big change in street and school fashions means millions and millions in garment revenue--even more $$ once the white mainstream, as is its won't, follows in the cutting edge's media-delayed wake.
****** "We've lost a whole generation to their own culture out here," rues an LAPD Assistant Commissioner in a 14 May '89 Boston TV news special on the national Wa-?On gangs, drugs, crime, Others…



There is a house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy
And God, I know I'm one
My mother was a tailor
Sewed my new blue jeans
My father was a gamblin' man
Down in New Orleans
Now the only thing a gambler needs
Is a suitcase and a trunk
And the only time that he's satisfied
Is when he's on a drunk
Oh mother, tell your children
Not to do what I have done
Spend your lives in sin and misery
In the House of the Rising Sun
Well, I've got one foot on the platform
And the other foot on the train
I'm going back to New Orleans
To wear that ball and chain
Well, there is a house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many young poor boy
And God, I know I'm one

And like one and one don't make two
One and one make one
And I'm looking for that free ride to me
I'm looking for you


I'd gladly lose me to find you

To catch you I'm gonna run and never stop
I'd pay any price just to win you
Surrender my good life for bad

Baby, I'm amazed at the way you love me all the time
And maybe I'm afraid of the way I love you
Maybe I'm amazed at the way you pulled me out of time
You hung me on a line
Maybe I'm amazed at the way I really need you

Baby, I'm a man, maybe I'm a lonely man
Who's in the middle of something
That he doesn't really understand
Baby, I'm a man, and maybe you're the only woman
Who could ever help me
Baby, won't you help me to understand?
Ooh-ah

Hey kids, shake it loose together
The spotlight's hitting something
That's been known to change the weather
We'll kill the fatted calf tonight so stick around
You're gonna hear electric music, solid walls of sound

Say, Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet?
Ooh, but they're so spaced out
B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets
Oh, but they're weird and they're wonderful
Oh, Bennie, she's really keen

She's got electric boots, a mohair suit
You know I read it in a magazine, oh
B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets

Hey kids, plug into the faithless
Maybe they're blinded, but Bennie makes them ageless
We shall survive, let us take ourselves along
Where we fight our parents out in the streets
To find who's right and who's wrong
Say, Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet?
Ooh, but they're so spaced out
B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets
Oh, but they're weird and they're wonderful

I close my eyes, only for a moment
And the moment's gone
All my dreams pass before my eyes, a curiosity

Dust in the wind
All they are is dust in the wind

Same old song, just a drop of water
In an endless sea
All we do crumbles to the ground
Though we refuse to see

Dust in the wind
All we are is dust in the wind

Oh, ho, ho


Now, don't hang on, nothing lasts forever but the earth and sky
It slips away, and all your money won't another minute buy
Dust in the wind
All we are is dust in the wind
(All we are is dust in the wind)
Dust in the wind
(Everything is dust in the wind)
Everything is dust in the wind

The wind



If we still have time, we might still get by
Every time I think about it, I wanna cry
With bombs and the Devil
Little kids keep coming
No way to breathe easy, no time to be young

But I tell myself that I was doing all right
There's nothing left to do at night

But go crazy on you
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you, oh

My love is the evening breeze touching your skin
The gentle, sweet singing of leaves in the wind
The whisper that calls after you in the night
And kisses your ear in the early moonlight

And you don't need to wonder, you're doing fine
My love, the pleasure's mine
Let me go crazy on you
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you, oh

Wild man's world is crying in pain
What you gonna do when everybody's insane?
So afraid of one who's so afraid of you
What you gonna do?

Ah
Ooh, crazy on you
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you

I was a willow last night in my dream
I bent down over a clear running stream
I sang you the song that I heard up above
And you kept me alive with your sweet flowing love
Crazy, yeah
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you, oh
Crazy on you
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you, yeah
Ah
Crazy on you
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you, oh



Woke up this morning with a wine glass in my hand
Whose wine, what wine, where the hell did I dine?
Must have been a dream. I don't believe where I've been
Come on - let's do it again
Do you, you feel like I do?
Do you, you feel like I do?
My friend got busted just the other day
They said don't walk, don't walk, don't walk away
He drove into a taxi. Bent the boot, hit the back
Had to play some music otherwise he'd crack
Do you, you feel like I do?
Do you, you feel like I do?
Do you, you feel like I do?
Do you, you feel like I do?
Champagne for breakfast and a sherman in my hand
White top, White tails, never fails
Must have been a dream. I don't believe where I've been
Come on - let's do it again
Do you, you feel like I do?
Do you, you feel like I do?



Louie Louie, oh no, you take me where ya gotta go, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, baby

Louie Louie, oh no no no, me gotta go, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, baby

The recording is the album’s version – the long one…




Ayyo, told you before.  Now you laying close to the floor
You forgot what the black thing in the holster was for
I’m a legend in the hood like Bishop and Tommy Bunds
Like old-school shit: Stan Smiths, Tommy Gun
Two fifths cripple you, but the MAC’ll body son
And I don’t fear no nigga that breathe—not a one
Looking at me, you looking at about two mill
You looking at a nigga destined.  Every week, new wheels
If I don’t hold New York down, then, dog, who will?
My album drop, niggas break up like Dru Hill
Starting coloring their hair and shit.  Rocking thong
Underwear and shit.  That right there is bitch
How you gon’ come amongst dogs when you scared of pits?
Only time you wile out: when you recording a skit
I rewind that and ask E-Rock, “Yo, where the 9 at?”
Let’s go to these cats’ show, put a hole where their spine at
Everything realer than real on my DATs
A lot of niggas gon’ crash at the wheel for my tracks
A lot of bitches gon’ drop they drawers when I rap
‘Cause life ain’t nothing but money.  Besides that
Don’t shit count.  I buy my beats on discount
‘Cause it’s good as gold whenever my shit’s out
Every word fall on blades whenever it slips out
Seeing you at the Grammys, holding my trophy with my dick out
Million of cats is running up with their picks out
Ready to die for me.  Holler at me with your chips out
Niggas going bitch route?  Put hits out
Then we get the chicks out, ice crucifix out
Chips out, whips out, gun and clips out
Niggas scared like it’s the day Suge gets out
State your name, gangster.  Bad Seed, motherfucker
Pull your boots up.  Go tell your mother I want to fuck her
Ayyo, all y’all niggas weaker than fuck.  Don’t make me
Creep in a truck.  With the blings on, heaters is up
Because y’all niggas won’t see a thing.  We all need the cream
I’m so cheap, I’ll squeeze a quarter ‘til the Eagle scream
Angelica, Marie, Tanya, and me dropped in a V
Dropped in my seat, cocking my heat
If niggas try to front, then I’m popping my heat
With the gold Lo lenses on—eighty a piece
I’ll have my niggas put your parts in a bottle, put your
Heart to the nozzle and give it to you like Paul Castellano
I’m greedy in life, willing to bite, Phillies I like
Yeah, I like guns, but only the Israelian kind
Aim for the sky, hold my pistol, aim to the side
I want a platinum Desert with my name engraved on the side
I is the pope.  Bitches keep their eyes on the rope
Sixty inches long, so my penis slide on the floor
Ride with a whore.  All y’all niggas die on the floor
I’m not a drycleaner but I keep an iron/eye on them all
Swim with the sharks, get money or sleep in the park
The world is too big.  If you don’t get money, you’re fucked
Nigga

You could catch me on  Ave
With the baddest Spanish mami just shaking her ass
Outside, hustling icebergs, smoking the grass
Watch fiends stumble up the block.  We just kick ‘em and laugh
Got soldiers in the wastelands, crystals on the smash
Hundred-thousand-dollar cars, cold steel, and the stash
Beef, you don’t want it.  I’m old-school like MASH
Take about eight niggas to pull my foot out your ass
Brooklyn be the borough, New York be the state
Filled with grimy niggas eating off the same plate
And me and my team came to do.  You never seen before
Hundreds of gorillas kicking down the doors
Strapped with street sweepers, Calicos, and .44s
Backed by fans, groupies, pimps, and hoes
In the streets, they hold me down like the Timbs on my feet
But I’m dirty, keep my hands like my balls and my meat
You heard me?  New York
I’m a underground vet.  I get ‘nough respect
And I rep the home of The Jets and The Mets
Yo, pet, don’t do something that you might regret
‘Cause if you want drama, that’s what you gon’ get
And when you’re on the train, bumping my cassette
You nod your head so hard, people think you got Tourette’s
I’ll fuck up your brain when I cross lanes like Stephon for The Nets
I’ll drop bombs, I’ll pop chrons
It’s cold weather, god.  Very cold weather, god
I’ll freeze my enemies zero degrees with their leathers on
Causing frostbite, I sever arms.  Upper echelon
With the thoughts of a terrorist from Lebanon
I’m paid, you played like a back from Benetton
My weapon’s on.  By the second song, your neck is gone
I’ma Genghis Khan this track, break his back
I’ma go plat ‘cause your moms sell my tape for crack
Fuck that.  Yo, yo, you know my style’s iller
Yo, y-yo, yo, it skipped up
Who next?  Bad Seed, don’t trip up

Ayyo, please allow me to introduce myself
Who the best, dog?  Got to tell the truth: myself
Who the only cat I fear in the booth?  Myself
Get money, get wealth for my health—who else?
It’s Bad-to-the, Bad Seed-to-the
Smoke weed ‘til I look like a Chinese nigga
Run with straight thugs and grimiest niggas
Got beef?  Clinton Hill where you find me, nigga
Come get it if you want it, dog.  You know how to get it
Catch a two-piece with biscuits right to your fitted
Niggas look at Bad Seed like, “Damn, he shouldn’t”
Mothers lose a son every time Seed spit it
Niggas mad, want to be Bad Seed critics ‘cause they
Know their baby momma probably let Seed hit it
And, yup, Seed did it and my man Seed with it
Any plan Seed start, that’s a plan Seed finish
Nigga
Ayyo, my flow is like cocaine.  Y’all niggas is
So lame, y’all like Kurt Cobain—no brains
You need to button it up, or, your grill, yo, I’m lumping it up
OK, uh huh, what’s up?  Shut up
I don’t play that.  Y’all niggas need to save that
Or I’ma put something hot where your face at
So when you look in the mirror, nigga, you could face that
You gonna see bullet holes all in your facemask
I’m on some Friday the 13th shit—where the lake at?
I’ma strap a Mazda 626 to your waistband
And watch you sink slow.  My cuatro-cinco flow
Spits a hundred and one rounds like Dalmatians
And fuck them cars you’ve got—I’m copping a spaceship
2001 Space Odyssey without the apes in it
We went from Goodyears to Michelins to Pirellis
Half of these niggas big, half these niggas Machiavelli
Half of these niggas is menace, half of these niggas belly
Half of them keep their mouth closed, half of them telling
The fuck you doing in rap?  Y’all niggas need to be shooting
Oops, my bad.  They ain’t picked you out for the movie
You must not had the flow, the look, or the jewelry
You never had the dough, a ho, or a O-Z, nigga

Ayyo, my crew bang shit like Bloods and Crips
This the clique?  You might end up in a ditch
With holes and shit, black eyes and fat lips
Pardon me for my behavior—man, fuck that shit
I’m living my life.  Every night, I’m fucking my wife
I’m keeping it trife, dirty like used baby wipes
You think I ain’t nice?  Nigga, then you’re best to think twice
I’m holding my own.  O.B.S. controlling the throne
You’re thinking you’re grown?  One blast, niggas is gone
Out in the streets, niggas be packing the heat
You’re thinking it’s sweet?  You must not know the Meat
The Magnum P leave you with casualties
The tragedy is that you fucked with we
O.B.S.  Who you thought it was supposed to be?
I’m locing, G.  Acting like I’m not supposed to be
Come close, you’ll see how we blaze niggas accurately

I’m too nice.  Y’all niggas can’t fuck with me
The biggest thing to hit the city since Kim Fields’ titties
Y’all not ready.  I’m lined up.  My cold flows
Freezes frames and leave eyes stuck
You couldn’t beat me if I sucked.  I’ll throw
Wild pitches at emcees.  Oh, see?  Now your time’s up
Blind fuck tied up with no way to escape
I’m the rope, the gag, and the dynamite taped to your waist
You bite so much, in the winter, your mouth breeds
The shape of my face.  Nondescript rap condiment
Get put on, but ate due to lack of confidence
I'll see "The Bitch in Yoo" but no Common Sense
Your rhymes couldn’t be fat if you injected them with collagen
I’m hot like halogen.  You blow like lots of wind
Yo, y’all niggas need to start following
Yo, wack emcees I’m swallowing and gobbling
Them niggas ain’t got nothing for me.  It’s gory
Pumpkinhead flip freestyle—end of story
Niggas can’t fuck with me when I’m in a zone
I’ll break your bones, leave you home alone
Beat you in the head with my cellular phone
Yo, I’ll come through always.  Yo, I’m long like
Project hallways.  Freak it like foreplay all day
Yo, check it out.  Freestyle my forte
Yo, I’m so intelligent, my brain boxes itself
I shoot like a Glock on your shelf that you got up
Ayyo, I’m propped up.  I’m out to mop up
Leave emcees broke up.  Yo, I’ll choke up
All the dust in my lungs from the blunt that I brung
Yo, check it.  Represent O.B.S
“For the Kids” Bad Seed record.  Go get it
Straight up, yo, emcees get ate up

Bad Seed five-foot-nine, big cock
Little dude with big plans and big Glocks
Don’t get it twisted ‘cause I love hip hop
I’ll run up in your crib, pop you, bloody your flip flops
Now you was too hype—probably ‘cause you had Belly on
But you don’t belong here like little Elián
I got your moms hostage—leave your celly on
For ransom.  She don’t want to leave—she think I’m handsome
I don’t blame her, though.  My name say it all
I’m that nigga you all know with the dangerous flow
About the size of Buckshot with the power of Freddie Foxxx
Push weight and rock steady, move steady rocks
You like what I got on my neck?  Then come get it
Push you back, hand on your face, mush you, black
In front of your priest and niggas with kufi hats
My Blockbusters you can’t get movies at
And everywhere I go, a nigga leave booby traps
I’ll break you up like Polo and Kool G Rap
This for my dogs and my bitches with their doobies wrapped
Keep it street like the ground where my shoes be at
Ayyo, ayyo, ayyo, fuck that shit
Bad Seed come through with the ruck rap shit
That click-clack shit.  Niggas get flipped backwards
‘Cause off the top of my ho, ayyo, I’ll bone broads on the mattress
You know my style be the fattest
Flip the beat up, ayyo, ayyo, and speed it up
Bad Seed come through.  Ayyo, I’ll beat it up
Like some coochie.  Come through, never rock 
But you might see me chilling with a chick with a doobie
Wrapped up and flipped up, click-clacked up
I’ll come through.  Motherfuckers be getting smackedup
Tattoo on my neck, tattoo on my arm
Ayyo, yo, Flex drop bombs
On my record.  If you don’t believe me, you could check it
B.D.S. coming through.  You know how we do
My nigga J grand master plan
Ayyo, ayyo, rubber band around my hand
Uh, snap it back, flip you in your nose
You know how I come through: get in your mom’s pantyhose
Uh, ayyo, I used to have a earring in my nose
But I took it.  Ayyo, go the Brooklyn route
Hop on the Manhattan Bridge.  Ayyo, this is “For the Kids”
My style be mad ill whenever, when niggas want skids
With the, with the lottos.  Ayyo, niggas want to act ill?
Ayyo, I’ll grab the motherfucking bottle
And break it on a...  Uh.  Ayyo, it’s sped up again
Bad Seed come through.  I’m getting fed up again
Let’s go head up again.  Ayyo, he changed the beat
And I’ma pass the microphone because this shit for the streets

Everything I’m spitting is raw
Spit for the streets, spit for the morgues
Spitting with heat, spitting with bars
If the fucking cops arrest me, I’ll spit through the bars
My flow is fucking NASA—I’m spitting from Mars
Spit for the cats, spit for the dogs
Heaven or Hell, Satan or God.  My soul’ll spit ‘til I’m gone
Fuck that.  I’m setting it off, letting it off
The weapons I draw went in y’all oral, deading y’all all
Arms, legs, eyeballs, heads on the floors
Fingers, toes, earlobes, chest on the floors
And I’ma be the first nigga to make a song called “Fuck All Y’all”
Fuck the cops and fuck the law, fuck the war
Break into a fucking whorehouse and fuck a whore
Jump off the bitch, then flip and fuck the floor
Fuck them broads, fuck them raw, fuck them all
Middle fingers in the air, nigga.  Fuck all y’all
‘Cause them type of niggas that be tempting me
To walk into your studio and empty three in your MPC
Put you in ER like NBC
Bootleg your album, sell that shit on MP3
And my bullets got tracking devices, so when they hit, they exit clean
Part your back, cave your chest, and buckle your knees
See, y’all labels who want to sign me?  Give me a Benz for free
Fuck them labels who didn’t sign me, fuck MTV
‘Cause, yo, my mouth is like a fucking loaded shotgun
Some niggas bust, some niggas won’t, but everybody got one
I’m gonna smoke you and your man and wait until the cops come
Your top’s spun, nigga.  We top gun, we gung-ho
I’ll let the guns blow when the funds low
With fucking AKs longer than Mutombo
And this goes out to the best of y’all.  We stretching y’all
Middle fingers in the air, nigga.  Fuck all y’all
‘Cause when it comes to I’s shit, I spit that hot shit
I’ll verbally spit fucking toxic comments
The only problem with that shit is that, with the force I’ma drop it
There ain’t gonna be a nigga alive on the planet to watch it
I’m from Brooknam, stomp you out, bloody galoshes
To my Fort Greene ghetto grimies locked in the boxes
To my grimy, ghetto niggas in Fort Greene projects
We from BK, motherfuckers.  It’s on—we’re popping
‘Cause when I cock my heater, I’ll make motherfuckers
Hot like Easter, stop they re-ups, block their beepers
That shit they kick’s softer than topless C-cups
I got high-class motherfuckers dropping teacups
‘Cause that shit that I spit is ill.  I told y’all niggas
Word up, BK some shit you feel, nigga

Hot style like kids from Columbine
Uncontrollable when it come to dollar signs
If you want it, shit, nigga, here’s mine
‘Nough heat up in the closet that’ll melt your spine
And leak your mind.  Bright lights’ll leave you blind
Buried in the dirt ‘til the end of time
The P ain’t lying.  I spit shit to leave your fam crying
Younger sibling mad as fuck ‘cause their brother’s dying
Do I give a fuck?  Nope.  The nigga asked for it
Ain’t got no love for you like I said on Brandon’s chorus
Got niggas that’ll ride and broads that die for us
Hoes up on the track—what more you want from us?
Beats and lyrics to dance and fuck to
Get high, get drunk—however you do you
I’ma lay it down worse than calm and simple
Magnum P rather burst like whitehead pimples
And it don’t stop and we won’t quit
‘Cause we from the borough that pops ‘nough shit
We come from BK, motherfucker, all day
Represent my block, BK all the way
Clinton Hill, Fort Greene, Flatbush, Bushwick
All the motherfucking places.  Williamsburg
It’s still part of my rhyme.  And niggas heard
It’d be Brooklyn everyday, all day
I don’t give a fuck where you come from, say:
BK.  Eyes closed, snot-nosed with a red eye
Keep my shit going on like a jet in the sky
But I’ma stop ‘cause I don’t freestyle
Why not?  ‘Cause my nigga P do.  My man, Pumpkinhed
Get on the mic with your eyes mad red
Spit that shit outside with the Feds outside
This nigga.  The Feds are outside
(Oh shit.  The Feds is not outside)
Yes, yes, they are nigga, and your eyes is red
(They ain’t gonna catch me)
They got you.  They’re coming, they’re coming, they’re coming

So what?  My eyes was red.  I was smoking a blunt
There’s Feds outside.  They try to give me what they want
Maybe two to five for a bag that I had in my pants.  Damn, man
Them niggas trying to come real hard on me
‘Cause they got Castro in my damn country
What’s the deal?  Yo, we got mass appeal.  We come through
Yo, grabbing the steel.  Yo, I’m grabbing the wheel
Making the turn, making it burn.  Yo, I’m like butter
Making it churn.  Niggas need to learn
That when I spit freestyle, I’m no joke
Emcees get broke down like Legos
L’eggo my Eggo—that shit’s mine.  The mic all the time
I shine, break down emcees like enzymes
Yo, I intertwine like jungle vines.  A perfectionist
I’m coming through, wrecking this.  You disrespecting this
You catch a TEC and clip to your neck and lips
I’m not playing.  Freestyle I’m displaying
Pumpkinhead coming through.  Emcees decaying
Underground.  In the cemetery, yo, I’ll leave ‘em buried
Freestyle, yo, I’ll never worry.  I’ll come through in a flurry
Like cold snow in the winter.  Ayyo
Y’all niggas is stuck up like splinters
I’m coming through and I’ll enter like Wu
Yo.  Yo, what you gonna do?
Flip the beat on me.  One to the two
Yo, my name is Pumpkinhead.  I’m from the Brooklyn Zoo
Emcees can’t handle me.  Yo, I’m like glue
Yo, you bounce off you and stick to me
Niggas try to front on me, I’ll leave them on their knees
Yo, they breeze like a leaf.  Ayyo, I’ll come through
You can’t conceive.  I’m like a lyrical disease
Ayyo, I’ll come through and I’ll please
All the shorties, yo, with the big booties
Everything I’m rhyming ends with “-ies”/ease
Get off these.  Niggas, please.  Yo
I’ll come through.  Y’all niggas is fucking queers
Yo, y’all can’t fuck with me.  I’m like Cheers
A round of applause

Here I come again now baby
Like a dog in heat
You tell it's me by the clamor now, baby
I like to tear up the street

Now I've been smoking for so long
You know I'm here to stay
Got you in a stranglehold baby
You best get out of the way


Road I cruise is a bitch now baby
You know you can't turn me 'round
If a house gets in my way baby
You know I'll burn it down

You ran that night that you left me
You put me in my place
Got you in a stranglehold now baby
Then I crushed your face


Sometimes you gonna get higher
Sometimes you gotta start low
Some people think they gonna die someday
I got news you never got to go

Come on, come on up;
Come on come on up;
Come on come on up;

You know you can't turn me 'round
If a house gets in my way
You know I'll burn it down

You ran that night that you left me
You put me in my place
I got you in a stranglehold baby
And then I crushed your face



I'm driving in my car
I turn on the radio
I'm pulling you close
You just say no
You say you don't like it
But girl I know you're a liar
Cause when we kiss
Ooooh, Fire

Late at night
I'm takin' you home
I say I wanna stay
You say you wanna be alone
You say you don't love me
But you can't hide your desire
And when we kiss
Oh, Fire
Fire

You got a hold on me right from the start
A grip so tight, I couldn't tear it apart
My nerves all jumpin'
Actin' like a fool
Well your kisses they burn
But your heart stays cool
Romeo and Juliet
Samson and Delilah
You can bet
Their love they couldn't deny
Your words say split
But your words they lie
When we kiss
Mmmmmm, Fire
Fire

Yeah!

I been up, I been down
Take my word, my way around
I ain't asking for much
I said, Lord, take me downtown
I'm just looking for some tush

I been bad, I been good
Dallas, Texas, Hollywood
I ain't asking for much
I said, Lord, take me downtown
I'm just looking for some tush

Take me back, way back home
Not by myself, not alone
I ain't asking for much
I said, Lord, take me downtown
I'm just looking for some tush



Intro:
Baby, When I think about you
I think about love (3 voices)
Darling, Don't live without you
And your love (3 voices)
If I have
Those golden dreams
Of my yesterday (voices)
I would wrap you
In the heaven
Till I'm dying (voices)
On the way
Feel like making -- -- -- --
Feel like making love(3)
Feel like making love to you
Baby, If I think about you
I think about love
Darling, If I live without you
I live without love
And if I had
The sun and moon
And they were shining
I would give you
Both night and day
Love satisfying
Repeat chorus-
And if I had
Those golden dreams
Of my yesterdays
I would wrap you
In the heaven
Till I'm dying
On the way
Repeat chorus many times (with solo)



The sky is cryin....
Can't you see the tears roll down the street
The sky is cryin....
Can't you see the tears roll down the street
I've been lookin' for my baby
And I wonder where can she be
I saw my baby early one morning
She was walkin' on down the street
I saw my baby early this morning
She was walkin' on down the street
You know it hurt me, hurt me so bad
Made my poor heart skip a beat
I've got a real real real real bad feelin'
That my baby, she don't love me no more
I've got a real real bad feelin'
That my baby don't love me no more
Well, this guy, this guy's been cryin'
Can't you see the tears roll down my nose



I met a devil woman
She took my heart away
She said I had it coming to me
But I wanted it that way
I think that any love is good lovin'
So I took what I could get
She looked at me with big brown eyes, and said
You ain't seen nothing yet
B-B-B-Baby you just ain't seen n-n-n-nothing yet
Here's something that your never gonna forget
B-B-B-Baby you just ain't seen n-n-n-nothing yet
And now I'm feeling better
Cuz I found out for sure
She took me to her doctor
And he told me of a cure
He said that any love is good love
So I took what I could get
Yes I took what I could get
And then she looked at me with those big brown eyes and said
You ain't seen nothing yet
B-B-Baby you just ain't seen n-n-nothing yet
Here's something, here's something your never gonna f-f-forget baby
You know you know you know you just ain't seen nothing yet
Any love is good lovin
So I took what I could get
Yes I took what I could get
And then, and then, and then she looked at me with those big brown eyes and said
You ain't seen nothing yet
Baby you just ain't seen n-n-nothing yet
Here's something, here's something, here's something that your never forget baby, baby b-b-b-b-b-baby
Baby you just ain't seen nothing yet



We all came out to Montreux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
But Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground

Smoke on the water
(And fire in the sky)
Smoke on the water

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race

Smoke on the water
(And fire in the sky)
Smoke on the water

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling-truck-Stones-thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights, a few old beds
We made a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know, I know we'll never forget

Smoke on the water
(And fire in the sky)
Smoke on the water



Gonna take a freight train
Down at the station, Lord
I don't care where it goes
Gonna climb a mountain
The highest mountain
Jump off, nobody gonna know

Can't you see, whoa, can't you see
What that woman, Lord, she been doin' to me
Can't you see, can't you see
What that woman, she been doin' to me

I'm gonna find me
A hole in the wall
I'm gonna crawl inside and die
'Cause my lady, now
A mean ol' woman, Lord
Never told me goodbye

Can't you see, whoa, can't you see
What that woman, Lord, she been doin' to me
Can't you see, can't you see
What that woman, she been doin' to me
I'm gonna buy a ticket, now
As far as I can
Ain't a-never comin' back
Ride me a southbound
All the way to Georgia, now
Till the train, it run out of track

Can't you see, whoa, can't you see
What that woman, Lord, she been doin' to me
Can't you see, can't you see
What that woman, she been doin' to me
Can't you see, whoa, can't you see
What that woman, Lord, she been doin' to me
Can't you see, can't you see
What that woman, she been doin' to me


Can't you see, whoa, can't you see
What that woman, Lord, she been doin' to me
Can't you see, can't you see
What that woman, she been doin' to me
Can't you see (Oh, she's such a crazy lady), can't you see
What that woman (What that woman), she been doin' to me
Can't you see (Lord, I can't stand), can't you see
What that woman, she been doin' to me
Can't you see (I'm gonna take a freight train)
Can't you see (Down at the station, Lord)
What that woman, she been doing to me (Ain't never coming back)
Can't you see (Gonna ride me a southbound, now), can't you see (All the way to Georgia, Lord)
What that woman, she been doing to me (Till the train, it run out of track)



I was a little too tall
Could've used a few pounds
Tight pants points hardly renown
She was a black haired beauty with big dark eyes
And points all her own, sitting way up high
Way up firm and high
Out past the cornfields where the woods got heavy
Out in the back seat of my '60 Chevy
Workin' on mysteries without any clues
Workin' on our night moves
Trying' to make some front page drive-in news
Workin' on our night moves in the summertime
In the sweet summertime
We weren't in love oh no far from it
We weren't searchin’ for some pie in the sky summit
We were just young and restless and bored
Living by the sword
And we'd steal away every chance we could
To the backroom, the alley, the trusty woods
I used her she used me
But neither one cared
We were getting our share
Workin' on our night moves
Trying to lose the awkward teenage blues
Workin' on our night moves
And it was summertime
Mhm, sweet summer time, summer time
And oh the wonder
Felt the lightning
And we waited on the thunder
Waited on the thunder
I woke last night to the sound of thunder
How far off I sat and wondered
Started humming a song from 1962
Ain't it funny how the night moves
When you just don't seem to have as much to lose
Strange how the night moves
With autumn closing in
Night Moves
Night moves (night moves)
Night moves (night moves)
Yeah, Remember, night moves
Sure do remember those night moves (night moves)
Ain't it funny how you remember (night moves)
Funny how you remember the night moves
I remember, I remember, I remember, I remember night whoa, whoa
It's works, Working and practicing
Oh, on the night moves
Working and practicing....



Yeah! Come on, come on, come on, come on
Now touch me, babe
Can't you see that I am not afraid?
What was that promise that you made?
Why won't you tell me what she said?
What was that promise that you made?
Now, I'm going to love you
Till the heavens stop the rain
I'm going to love you
Till the stars fall from the sky
For you and I

Come on, come on, come on, come on
Now touch me, babe
Can't you see that I am not afraid?
What was that promise that you made?
Why won't you tell me what she said?
What was that promise that you made?

Now, I'm going to love you
Till the heavens stop the rain
I'm going to love you
Till the stars fall from the sky
For you and  I
I'm going to love you
'Til the heavens stop the rain
I'm going to love you
'Til the stars fall from the sky
For you and I

Stronger than dirt



Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ahh, yeah

I live my life like there's no tomorrow
And all I've got I had to steal
Least I don't need to beg or borrow
Yes, I'm livin' at a pace that kills
Ooh, yeah

(Runnin' with the devil)
Ah, Ah-ha yeah, whoo-hoo-ooh
(Runnin' with the devil)
I'll tell y'all about it

I found the simple life ain't so simple
When I jumped out on that road
I got no love, no love you'd call real
Ain't got nobody waitin' at home

Ahh, yeah
(Runnin' with the devil)
God damn it lady, you know I ain't lying to ya
I'm only gonna tell you one time
Aah, yeah
(Runnin' with the devil)
Yes I am
Yeah
Whoo
Whoo

You know I—
I found the simple life, weren't so simple, no
When I jumped out on that road
Got no love, no love you'd call real
Got nobody waiting at home

(Runnin' with the devil)
(Runnin' with the devil)

Woo

(Runnin' with the devil)
(Runnin' with the devil)



If you want to hang out
You've got to take her out

If you want to get down
Down on the ground

You want to kick the blues

And you wanna ride on

​
(2, 3, 4)

Ahh! Ahh!
We come from the land of the ice and snow
From the midnight sun where the hot springs flow

The hammer of the gods
Will drive our ships to new lands
To fight the horde, sing and cry
Valhalla, I am coming

On we sweep with threshing oar
Our only goal will be the western shore

Ahh! Ahh!
We come from the land of the ice and snow
From the midnight sun where the hot springs flow

How soft your fields so green
Can whisper tales of gore
Of how we calmed the tides of war
We are your overlords
On we sweep with threshing oar
Our only goal will be the western shore

So now you'd better stop
And rebuild all your ruins
For peace and trust can win the day
Despite of all your losing



Here I stand head in hand
Turn my face to the wall
If she's gone I can't go on
Feeling two-foot small
Everywhere people stare
Each and every day
I can see them laugh at me
And I hear them say

Hey, you've got to hide your love away
Hey, you've got to hide your love away

How can I even try
I can never win
Hearing them, seeing them
In the state I'm in
How could she say to me
Love will find a way
Gather round all you clowns
Let me hear you say

Hey, you've got to hide your love away
Hey, you've got to hide your love away



One two!

I was born in a crossfire hurricane
And I howled at the morning drivin' rain

But it's all right now, in fact, it's a gas
But it's all right, I'm Jumpin' Jack Flash
It's a gas, gas, gas

I was raised by a toothless, bearded hag
I was schooled with a strap right across my back

But it's all right now, in fact, it's a gas
But it's all right, I'm Jumpin' Jack Flash
It's a gas, gas, gas
Oooh!

I was drowned, I was washed up and left for dead
I fell down to my feet and I saw they bled
Yeah, yeah
I frowned at the crumbs of a crust of bread
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I was crowned with a spike right thru my head
My, my, yeah

But it's all right now, in fact, it's a gas
But it's all right, I'm Jumpin' Jack Flash
It's a gas, gas, gas

Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas
Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas
Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas
Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas
Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas
Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas



Levon bears his war wound like a crown
He calls his child Jesus
'Cause he likes the name
And he sends him to the finest school in town
Levon, Levon likes his money
He makes a lot, they say
Spends his days countin'
In a garage by the motorway

He was born a pauper to a pawn on a Christmas day
When the New York Times said "God is dead
And the War's begun"
Alvin Tostig has a son today

And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
And he shall be Levon
In tradition with the family plan
And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
He shall be Levon

Levon sells cartoon balloons in town
His family business thrives
Jesus blows up balloons all day
Sits on the porch swing, watchin' them fly
And Jesus, he wants to go to Venus
Leave Levon far behind
Take a balloon and go sailin'
While Levon, Levon slowly dies
He was born a pauper to a pawn on a Christmas day
When the New York Times said "God is dead
And the War's begun"
Alvin Tostig has a son today

And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
And he shall be Levon
In tradition with the family plan
Whoo! And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
He shall be Levon
And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
And he shall be Levon
In tradition with the family plan
Whoo! And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
He shall be Levon



Hoo hoo

This here's a story 'bout Billy Joe and Bobbie Sue
Two young lovers with nothing better to do
Than sit around the house, get high, and watch the tube
And here's what happened when they decided to cut loose
They headed down to, ooh, old El Paso
That's where they ran into a great big hassle
Billy Joe shot a man while robbing his castle
Bobbie Sue took the money and run
Hoo hoo hoo

Go on, take the money and run
Go on, take the money and run
Hoo hoo hoo
Go on, take the money and run
Go on, take the money and run
Hoo hoo hoo

Billy Mack is a detective down in Texas
You know he knows just exactly what the facts is
He ain't gonna let those two escape justice
He makes his living off of the people's taxes
Bobbie Sue, whoa, whoa, she slipped away
Billy Joe caught up to her the very next day
They got the money, hey
You know they got away
They headed down south, and they're still running today
Singing

Go on, take the money and run
Go on, take the money and run
Hoo hoo hoo
Go on, take the money and run, oh Lord
Go on, take the money and run
Hoo hoo hoo

Yeah, yeah
Go on, take the money and run (Yeah, yeah)

Wake up, Maggie
I think I got something to say to you
It's late September and
I really should be back at school

I know I keep you amused
But I feel I'm being used
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried anymore
You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone
You stole my heart and that's what really hurts

The morning sun, when it's in your face
Really shows your age
That don't worry me none
In my eyes, you're everything

I laughed at all of your jokes
My love you didn't need to coax
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried anymore
You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone
You stole my soul and that's a pain I can do without
All I needed was a friend
To lend a guiding hand
But you turned into a lover, and mother what a lover!
You wore me out

All you did was wreck my bed
And in the morning kick me in the head
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried anymore
You led me away from home
'Cause you didn't want to be alone
You stole my heart, I couldn't leave you if I tried


I suppose I could collect my books
And get on back to school
Or steal my daddy's cue
And make a living out of playing pool

Or find myself a rock & roll band
That needs a helping hand
Oh, Maggie, I wished I'd never seen your face
You made a first-class fool out of me
But I'm as blind as a fool can be
You stole my heart, but I love you anyway

Maggie, I wished I'd never seen your face
I'll get on back home one of these days, ooh, ooh, ooh



Get your motor runnin'
Head out on the highway
Looking for adventure
In whatever comes our way

Yeah, darlin', go and make it happen
Take the world in a love embrace
Fire all of your guns at once
And explode into space

I like smoke and lightnin'
Heavy metal thunder
Racing with the wind
And the feeling that I'm under

Yeah, darlin', go and make it happen
Take the world in a love embrace
Fire all of your guns at once
And explode into space

Like a true nature's child
We were born, born to be wild
We can climb so high
I never wanna die
Born to be wild
Born to be wild

Get your motor runnin'
Head out on the highway
Looking for adventure
In whatever comes our way

Yeah, darlin', go and make it happen
Take the world in a love embrace
Fire all of your guns at once
And explode into space

Like a true nature's child
We were born, born to be wild
We can climb so high
I never wanna die
Born to be wild
Born to be wild



In a white room with black curtains near the station
Black roof country, no gold pavements, tired starlings
Silver horses ran down moonbeams in your dark eyes
Dawnlight smiles on you leaving, my contentment
I'll wait in this place where the sun never shines
Wait in this place where the shadows run from themselves
You said no strings could secure you at the station
Platform ticket, restless diesels, goodbye windows
I walked into such a sad time at the station
As I walked out, felt my own need just beginning
I'll wait in the queue when the trains come back
Lie with you where the shadows run from themselves

At the party she was kindness in the hard crowd
Consolation for the old wound now forgotten
Yellow tigers crouched in jungles in her dark eyes
She's just dressing, goodbye windows, tired starlings
I'll sleep in this place with the lonely crowd;
Lie in the dark where the shadows run from themselves



Call me the breeze
I keep blowin' down the road
Well now they call me the breeze
I keep blowin' down the road
I ain't got me nobody
I don't carry me no load

Ain't no change in the weather
Ain't no changes in me
Well there ain't no change in the weather
Ain't no changes in me
And I ain't hidin' from nobody
Nobody's hidin' from me
Oh, that's the way its supposed to be


Well I got that green light baby
I got to keep movin' on
Well I got that green light baby
I got to keep movin' on
Well I might go out to California
Might go down to Georgia
I don't know

Well I dig you Georgia peaches
Makes me feel right at home
Well now I dig you Georgia peaches
Makes me feel right at home
But I don't love me no one woman
So I can't stay in Georgia long

Well now they call me the breeze
I keep blowin' down the road
Well now they call me the breeze
I keep blowin' down the road
I ain't got me nobody
I don't carry me no load

Oooh Mr. Breeze



You're always dancing down the street
With your suede blue eyes
And every new boy that you meet
He doesn't know the real surprise

(Here she comes again)
When she's dancing 'neath the starry sky, ooh
She'll make you flip
(Here she comes again)
When she's dancing 'neath the starry sky

When people keep repeating
That you'll never fall in love
When everybody keeps retreating
But you can't seem to get enough

Let my love open the door
Let my love open the door
Let my love open the door
To your heart

Let my love open the door
Let my love open the door
Let my love open the door

To your heart
Let my love open the door
Let my love open the door

Let my love open the door

I have the only key to your heart
I can stop you falling apart
Try today, you'll find this way
Come on and give me a chance to say
Let my love open the door, it's all I'm living for
Release yourself from misery
There's only one thing gonna set you free
That's my love, that's my love

Let my love open the door
Let my love open the door
Let my love open the door
Let my love open the door

When tragedy befalls you
Don't let it drag you down
Love can cure your problems
You're so lucky I'm around
Let my love open the door
Let my love open the door
Let my love open the door
To your heart

Take a look at my girlfriend
She's the only one I got
Not much of a girlfriend
I never seem to get a lot
Take a jumbo across the water
Like to see America
See the girls in California
I'm hoping it's going to come true
But there's not a lot I can do

Could we have kippers for breakfast
Mummy dear, Mummy dear?
They gotta have 'em in Texas
Cos everyone's a millionaire
I'm a winner, I'm a sinner
Do you want my autograph?
I'm a loser, what a joker
I'm playing my jokes upon you
While there's nothing better to do, hey


Don't you look at my girlfriend (Girlfriend)
She's the only one I got

Ba da da dum
Ba da da dum

The sky is burnin'
I believe my soul's on fire
You are, I'm learnin', the key to my desire
Waiting for the van to arrive
The prisoners were lined up outside
Jumped a wall, hitched a ride, and now I'm here to stay
Love you baby anyway
The sky is burnin'
I believe my soul's on fire
You are, I'm learnin', the key to my desire
Ran across the country fields in all the rain
They had guns and dogs and everything
Swam the river tryin' to lose my trail
But they caught me; under the bridge, whoa yeah!
The sky is burnin'
I believe my soul's on fire
You are, I'm learnin', the key to my desire, oh yeah
Oh, yeah
The sky is burnin'
I believe my soul's on fire
You are, I'm learnin', the key to my desire
The judge said this man's a danger to humanity
We're gonna lock him up and throw away the key
Now baby, your love has sent me to jail
But I'd rather die than see you with another man
Yeah it's burnin', baby
Mmm mmmm
I believe my soul's on fire
I believe my soul's on fire
Working on the railroad every day
But they can't keep me here
And I'm not gonna stay
I got to get outta this place
Out to see you, baby
Yeah it's burnin'
Yeah, burnin'
I believe my soul's on fire
Oh, burnin'
Ah, yeah, ah oh ...



Long distance runaround
Long time waiting to feel the sound
I still remember the dream there
I still remember the time you said goodbye
Did we really tell lies?
Letting in the sunshine
Did we really count to one hundred?
Cold summer listening
Hot colour melting the anger to stone
I still remember the dream there
I still remember the time you said goodbye
Did we really tell lies?
Letting in the sunshine
Did we really count to one hundred?
Long distance runaround
Long time waiting to feel the sound
I still remember the dream there
I still remember the time you said goodbye
Cold summer listening
Hot colour melting the anger to stone
I still remember the dream there
I still remember the time you said goodbye
Did we really tell lies?
Letting in the sunshine
Did we really count to one hundred?
Looking for the sunshine



Welcome to the Grand illusion
Come on in and see what's happening
Pay the price, get your tickets for the show
The stage is set, the band starts playing
Suddenly your heart is pounding
Wishing secretly you were a star
But don't be fooled by the radio
The TV or the magazines
They show you photographs of how your life should be
But they're just someone else's fantasy
So if you think your life is complete confusion
Because you never win the game
Just remember that it's a Grand illusion
'Cause deep inside we're all the same
We're all the same...
So if you think your life is complete confusion
Because your neighbors got it made
Just remember that it's a Grand illusion
And deep inside we're all the same
America spells competition
Join us in our blind ambition
Get yourself a brand new motor car
Someday soon we'll stop to ponder
What on Earth's this spell we're under
We made the grade and still we wonder
Who the hell we are



Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real, and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever

Living is easy with eyes closed
Misunderstanding all you see
It's getting hard to be someone, but it all works out
It doesn't matter much to me
Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real, and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever
No one I think is in my tree
I mean it must be high or low
That is you can't, you know, tune in, but it's all right
That is I think it's not too bad

Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real, and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever
Always, no, sometimes think it's me
But you know I know when it's a dream
I think I know, I mean, er, yes, but it's all wrong
That is I think I disagree

Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real, and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever
Strawberry Fields forever
Strawberry Fields forever

When are you gonna come down?
When are you going to land?
I should have stayed on the farm
I should have listened to my old man
You know you can't hold me forever
I didn't sign up with you
I'm not a present for your friends to open
This boy's too young to be singing the blues

Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah

So goodbye yellow brick road
Where the dogs of society howl
You can't plant me in your penthouse
I'm going back to my plough
Back to the howling old owl in the woods
Hunting the horny-back toad
Oh, I've finally decided my future lies
Beyond the yellow brick road

Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah
What do you think you'll do, then?
I bet they'll shoot down the plane
It'll take you a couple of vodka and tonics
To set you on your feet again
Maybe you'll get a replacement
There's plenty like me to be found
Mongrels who ain't got a penny
Sniffing for tidbits like you on the ground

Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah

So goodbye yellow brick road
Where the dogs of society howl
You can't plant me in your penthouse
I'm going back to my plough
Back to the howling old owl in the woods
Hunting the horny-back toad
Oh, I've finally decided my future lies
Beyond the yellow brick road

Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah



1955 in Boston down at St.Elizabeth's
My momma took me home
To the three decker
Across from the playground
Where the townies slept
Their wives were kept
In the Whiskey Point part of town
My old man was a fire-fighter
Station house #4
In 69 our close friend Joe
Drowned on a dare
Swimmin' across the reservoir
Everybody sit out on the
Schoolyard steps
Dealin' Jacks or Better
While the older cooler guys
Survived high school
Went to war in Vietnam
I could have been a mystery writer
A singer in a rock-n-roll band
Floored you for a ten count
Like a prize figher
Take it deep in Fenway for a grand-slam
Oh no! I'm just a simple man
The Simple man finds a simple girl
They do the right thing
Down at the V.F.W Hall
And everyone dances till midnight
My Uncle Walter starts the first fight
When its all done and over
Down to St.Vincent's to confess
That Whiskey Point hangover
Good for ten Hail Mary's I guess
Stick to the game plan
Im just a simple man
All roads down Harvard Street
Lead over High Street Hill
Little Stevie takes your action
At Foley's Bar and Grill
He'd look you in the eye
Said always understand boy
You were born to carry on
You're just a simple man
I could have been a mystery writer
A singer in a rock-n-roll band
Floored you for a ten count
Like a prize fighter
Take it deep in Fenway
For a grand slam
Oh No! Im just a simple man



It was a beautiful day, the sun beat down
I had the radio on, I was drivin'
Trees went by, me and Del were singin' little Runaway
I was flyin'

Yeah, runnin' down a dream that never would come to me
Workin' on a mystery, goin' wherever it leads
Runnin' down a dream

I felt so good, like anything was possible
Hit cruise control and rubbed my eyes
The last three days the rain was unstoppable
It was always cold, no sunshine

Yeah, runnin' down a dream that never would come to me
Workin' on a mystery, goin' wherever it leads
Runnin' down a dream

I rolled on, the sky grew dark
I put the pedal down to make some time
There's something good waitin' down this road
I'm pickin' up whatever's mine
I'm runnin' down a dream that never would've come to me
Workin' on a mystery, goin' wherever it leads
Runnin' down a dream
Yeah, I'm runnin' down a dream that never would've come to me
Workin' on a mystery, goin' wherever it leads
I'm runnin' down a dream



Dear Mister Fantasy, play us a tune
Something to make us all happy
Do anything, take us out of this gloom
Sing a song, play guitar, make it snappy
You are the one who can make us all laugh
But doing that, you break out in tears
Please don't be sad if it was a straight mind you had
We wouldn't have known you all these years


Dear Mister Fantasy, play us a tune
Something to make us all happy
Do anything, take us out of this gloom
Sing a song, play guitar, make it snappy (yeah)


Dear Mister Fantasy, play us a tune
Something to make us all happy

Sing a song, play guitar, make it snappy
You are the one who can make us all laugh
But doing that, you break out in tears
Please don't be sad if it was a straight mind you had
We wouldn't have known you all these years



Now here you go again, you say you want your freedom
Well, who am I to keep you down?
It's only right that you should play the way you feel it
But listen carefully to the sound of your loneliness

Like a heartbeat drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering what you had
And what you lost
And what you had
And what you lost

Oh, thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Say, women, they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know
You'll know

Now here I go again, I see the crystal visions
I keep my visions to myself
It's only me who wants to wrap around your dreams
And have you any dreams you'd like to sell?
Dreams of loneliness
Like a heartbeat drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering what you had
And what you lost
And what you had
Oh, what you lost

Thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Women, they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know

Oh, thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Say, women, they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know

You'll know
You will know
Oh, you'll know

And disciplinary remains mercifully
Yes and um, I’m with you Derek, this star nonsense
Yes, yes, now which is it?
I am sure of it

So, so you think you can tell
Heaven from Hell? Blue skies from pain?
Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil? Do you think you can tell?
Did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees? Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change? Did you exchange
A walk-on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?


How I wish, how I wish you were here
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fishbowl year after year
Running over the same old ground, what have we found?
The same old fears, wish you were here



The sun don't shine
The moon don't move the tides
To wash me clean
Sun don't shine
The moon don't move the tides
To wash me clean
Why so unforgiving and why so cold?
Been a long time crossing bridge of sighs
Cold wind blows
The Gods look down in anger
On this poor child
Cold wind blows
And Gods look down in anger
On this poor child
Why so unforgiving and why so cold?
Been a long time crossing bridge of sighs



Backstroking lover, always hiding 'neath the covers
'Til I talked to my daddy, he say
He said, "You ain't seen nothing 'til you're down on a muffin
Then you're sure to be a-changing your ways."
I met a cheerleader, was a real young bleeder
All the times I could reminisce
'Cause the best things of loving with her sister and her cousin
Only started with a little kiss, like this


See-saw swinging with the boys in the school
With your feet flying up in the air
Singing "Hey, diddle-diddle with your kitty in the middle
Of the swing like I didn't care."
So I took a big chance at the high school dance
With a missy who was ready to play
Wasn't me she was fooling 'cause she knew what she was doing
And I knew love was here to stay when she told me to

"Walk this way, talk this way"
"Walk this way, walk this way"
"Walk this way, walk this way"
"Walk this way, talk this way"
Ah, just give me a kiss
Like this

Schoolgirl sweetie with the classy kinda sassy
Little skirt's climbing way up her knee
There was three young ladies in the school gym locker
When I noticed they was looking at me
I was a high school loser, never made it with a lady
'Til the boys told me something I missed
Then my next door neighbor with a daughter had a favor
So I gave her just a little kiss, like this


See-saw swinging with the boys in the school
With your feet flying up in the air
Singing "Hey, diddle-diddle with your kitty in the middle
Of the swing like I didn't care."
So I took a big chance at the high school dance
With a missy who was ready to play
Wasn't me she was fooling 'cause she knew what she was doing
And I knew love was here to stay when she told me to

"Walk this way, talk this way"
"Walk this way, walk this way"
"Walk this way, walk this way"
"Walk this way, talk this way"
Just give me a kiss
Like this



There are places I'll remember
All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain

All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends, I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new

Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I love you more

Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I love you more

In my life, I love you more



Let the good times roll
Let them knock you around
Let the good times roll
Let them make you a clown

Let them leave you up in the air
Let them brush your rock and roll hair
Let the good times roll
Let the good times roll, oh
Let the good times roll

Let the stories be told
Let them say what they want
Let the photos be old
Let them show what they want

Let them leave you up in the air
Let them brush your rock and roll hair
Let the good times roll
Let the good times roll, oh
Won't you let the good times roll
Good times roll

If the illusion is real
Let them give you a ride
If they got thunder appeal
Let them be on your side

Let them leave you up in the air
Let them brush your rock and roll hair
Let the good times roll
Won't you let the good times roll, oh
Let the good times roll
Let the good times roll
Won't you let the good times roll
Well, let the good times roll
Let 'em roll
Good times roll
Let the good times roll
Let the good times roll
Ooh, let the good times roll
Let 'em roll (Good times roll)
Well, let the good times roll (Let the good times roll)
Let the good times roll (Good times roll)
(Let the good times roll)
Let the good times roll
Let 'em roll



Oh, baby
Well there's a light in your eye that keeps shining
Like a star that can't wait for the night
I hate to think I've been blinded, baby
Why can't I see you tonight?
And the warmth of your smile starts a-burning
And the thrill of your touch gives me fright
And I'm shaking so much, really yearning
Why don't you show up, make it all right?
Yeah, it's all right

And if you promised you'd love so completely
And you said you would always be true
You swore that you never would leave me, baby
What ever happened to you?
And you thought it was only in movies
As you wish all your dreams would come true
It ain’t the first time believe me, baby
I'm standing here feeling blue
Yeah I'm blue

Now I will stand in the rain on the corner
I'll watch the people go shuffling downtown
Another ten minutes no longer
And then I'm turning around
The clock on the wall's moving slower
My heart it sinks to the ground
And the storm that I thought would blow over
Clouds the light of the love that I found
Light of the love that I found
Light of the love that I found
Oh, that I found
Hey, babe!
Ooh! Hands on the clock
Just don’t seem to stop when I’m thinking it over
Ooh! Tired of the light
I just don’t seem to find
Gotta get away, get away
Ooh! I see it in my dreams
But I just don’t seem to be
I’ve got to get all, gotta get it all
Gotta get it all, I’ve got to get all

Now my body is starting to quiver
And the palms of my hands getting wet
I've got no reason to doubt you, baby
It's all a terrible mess
And I'll run in the rain till I'm breathless
When I'm breathless I'll run till I drop, hey
The thoughts of a fool's kind of careless
I'm just a fool waiting on the wrong block, oh yeah

Light of the love that I found
Light of the love that I found
Light of the love that I
Light of the love that I found
Light of the, hey, eh, light of the, hey, eh
Light of the love that I found
Light of the love that I found



Aah!
You say you want a revolution
Well, you know
We all want to change the world
You tell me that it's evolution
Well, you know
We all want to change the world

But when you talk about destruction
Don't you know that you can count me out

Don't you know it's gonna be
Alright
Alright
Alright

You say you got a real solution
Well, you know
We'd all love to see the plan
You ask me for a contribution
Well, you know
We're all doing what we can
But if you want money for people with minds that hate
All I can tell you is, brother, you have to wait

Don't you know it's gonna be
Alright
Alright
Alright


You say you'll change the constitution
Well, you know
We all want to change your head
You tell me it's the institution
Well, you know
You better free your mind instead

But if you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao
You ain't going to make it with anyone anyhow

Don't you know it's gonna be
Alright
Alright
Alright
Alright, alright
Alright, alright
Alright, alright
Alright, alright!



In the day, we sweat it out on the streets
Of a runaway American dream
At night, we ride through mansions of glory
In suicide machines
Sprung from cages out on Highway 9
Chrome wheeled, fuel injected and steppin' out over the line
Oh, baby this town rips the bones from your back
It's a death trap, it's a suicide rap
We gotta get out while we're young
`Cause tramps like us, baby we were born to run
Yes, girl, we were
Wendy let me in, I wanna be your friend
I want to guard your dreams and visions
Just wrap your legs 'round these velvet rims
And strap your hands across my engines
Together we could break this trap
We'll run till we drop, baby we'll never go back
Oh, will you walk with me out on the wire?
`Cause baby I'm just a scared and lonely rider
But I gotta know how it feels
I want to know if love is wild, babe
I want to know if love is real
Oh, can you show me?

Beyond the palace, hemi-powered drones
Scream down the boulevard
The girls comb their hair in rearview mirrors
And the boys try to look so hard
The amusement park rises bold and stark
Kids are huddled on the beach in a mist
I wanna die with you, Wendy, on the streets tonight
In an everlasting kiss
(1, 2, 3, 4) The highways jammed with broken heroes
On a last chance power drive
Everybody's out on the run tonight
But there's no place left to hide
Together, Wendy, we can live with the sadness
I'll love you with all the madness in my soul
Oh, someday girl, I don't know when
We're gonna get to that place
Where we really want to go, and we'll walk in the sun
But till then, tramps like us
Baby, we were born to run
Oh honey, tramps like us
Baby, we were born to run
Come on with me, tramps like us
Baby, we were born to run



Rrr, ¡sabor!
Oye cómo va mi ritmo
Bueno pa' gozar, mulata
Oye cómo va mi ritmo
Bueno pa' gozar mulata
Oye cómo va mi ritmo
Bueno pa' gozar, mulata
Oye cómo va mi ritmo
Bueno pa' gozar mulata



Your everlasting summer
And you can see it fading fast
So you grab a piece of something
That you think is gonna last
Well, you wouldn't even know a diamond
If you held it in your hand
The things you think are precious
I can't understand

Are you reelin' in the years?
Stowin' away the time?
Are you gatherin' up the tears?
Have you had enough of mine?
Are you reelin' in the years?
Stowin' away the time?
Are you gatherin' up the tears?
Have you had enough of mine?

You been tellin' me you're a genius
Since you were seventeen
In all the time I've known you
I still don't know what you mean
The weekend at the college
Didn't turn out like you planned
The things that pass for knowledge
I can't understand
Are you reelin' in the years?
Stowin' away the time?
Are you gatherin' up the tears?
Have you had enough of mine?
Are you reelin' in the years?
Stowin' away the time?
Are you gatherin' up the tears?
Have you had enough of mine?


I spend a lot of money
And I spent a lot of time
The trip we made to Hollywood
Is etched upon my mind
After all the things we've done and seen
You find another man
The things you think are useless
I can't understand

Are you reelin' in the years?
Stowin' away the time?
Are you gatherin' up the tears?
Have you had enough of mine?
Are you reelin' in the years?
Stowin' away the time?
Are you gatherin' up the tears?
Have you had enough of mine?



Every breath you take
And every move you make
Every bond you break
Every step you take
I'll be watching you
Every single day
And every word you say
Every game you play
Every night you stay

Every move you make
And every vow you break
Every smile you fake
Every claim you stake
I'll be watching you
Since you've gone, I've been lost without a trace
I dream at night, I can only see your face
I look around, but it's you I can't replace
I feel so cold, and I long for your embrace
I keep crying baby, baby, please

Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm

Well, they'll stone you when you're tryin' to be so good
They'll stone you just like they said they would
They'll stone you when you're trying to go home
Then they'll stone you when you're there all alone

But I would not feel so all alone
Everybody must get stoned

Well, they'll stone you when you're walking on the street
They'll stone you when you're trying to keep your seat
They'll stone you when you're walking on the floor
They'll stone you when you're walking through the door

But I would not feel so all alone
Everybody must get stoned

They'll stone you when you're at the breakfast table
They'll stone you when you are young and able
They'll stone you when you're trying to make a buck
They'll stone you and then they'll say, "Good luck"
Yeah, but I would not feel so all alone
Everybody must get stoned

Well, they'll stone you and say that that's the end (Yeah)
Then they'll stone you and then they'll come back again (Yes they will)
They'll stone you when you're riding in your car
They'll stone you when you're playing your guitar

Yes, but I would not feel so all alone
Everybody must get stoned, alright

Well, they'll stone you when you are all alone (Oh, yes they will)
They'll stone you when you are walking home
They'll stone you and then say they're all brave
They'll stone you when you're sent down in your grave

But I would not feel so all alone
Everybody must get stoned



We got somethin', we both know it
We don't talk too much about it
Ain't no real big secret all the same
Somehow we get around it

Listen, it don't really matter to me, baby
You believe what you want to believe

You see, you don't have to live like a refugee
(Don't have to live like a refugee)

Somewhere, somehow, somebody
Must have kicked you around some
Tell me why you wanna lay there
And revel in your abandon

Honey, it don't make no difference to me, baby
Everybody's had to fight to be free

You see, you don't have to live like a refugee
(Don't have to live like a refugee)
No baby, you don't have to live like a refugee
(Don't have to live like a refugee)
Baby, we ain't the first
I'm sure a lot of other lovers been burned
Right now this seems real to you
But it's one of those things
You got to feel to be true

Somewhere, somehow, somebody
Must have kicked you around some
Who knows, maybe you were kidnapped
Tied up, taken away, and held for ransom

Honey, it don't really matter to me, baby
Everybody's had to fight to be free

You see, you don't have to live like a refugee
(Don't have to live like a refugee)
No, you don't have to live like a refugee
(Don't have to live like a refugee)
You don't have to live like a refugee
(Don't have to live like a refugee)



Come in here, dear boy, have a cigar, you're gonna go far
You're gonna fly high, you're never gonna die
You're gonna make it if you try, they're gonna love you
Well, I've always had a deep respect an' I mean that most sincerely
The band is just fantastic, that is really what I think
Oh, by the way, which one's Pink?
And did we tell you the name of the game, boy?
We call it riding the gravy train
We're just knocked out, we heard about the sell-out
You gotta get an album out, you owe it to the people
We're so happy we can hardly count
Everybody else is just green, have you seen the chart?
It's a hell of a start, it could be made into a monster
If we all pull together as a team
And did we tell you the name of the game, boy?
We call it riding the gravy train



Begin the day with a friendly voice
A companion unobtrusive
Plays that song that's so elusive
And the magic music makes your morning mood

Off on your way, hit the open road
There is magic at your fingers
For the spirit ever lingers
Undemanding contact in your happy solitude

Invisible airwaves crackle with life
Bright antennae bristle with the energy
Emotional feedback on a timeless wavelength
Bearing a gift beyond price, almost free

All this machinery making modern music
Can still be open-hearted
Not so coldly charted
It's really just a question of your honesty
Yeah, your honesty
One likes to believe in the freedom of music
But glittering prizes
And endless compromises
Shatter the illusion of integrity, yeah
Invisible airwaves crackle with life
Bright antennae bristle with the energy
Emotional feedback on a timeless wavelength
Bearing a gift beyond price, almost free


For the words of the profits
Were written on the studio wall
Concert hall
And echoes with the sound
Of salesmen
Of salesmen
Of salesmen!



Spent my days with a woman unkind
Smoked my stuff and drank, all my wine
Made up my mind to make a new start
Going to California with an aching, in my heart
Someone told me there's a girl out there
With love in her eyes and flowers, in her hair

Took my chances on a big jet plane
Never let 'em tell you that they're all the same
The sea was red and the sky was grey
Wondered how tomorrow, could ever follow today
The mountains and the canyons start to tremble and shake
As the children of the sun began to awake (watch out)

Seems that the wrath of the gods
Got a punch on the nose, and it started to flow
I think I might be sinking
Throw me a line, if I reach it in time
I'll meet you up there where the path runs straight and high

To find a queen without a king
They say she plays guitar and cries and sings... La la la la
Ride a white mare in the footsteps of dawn
Tryin' to find a woman who's never, never, never been born
Standing on a hill in my mountain of dreams
Telling myself it's not as hard, hard, hard as it seems...
Ah, ah, ah, ah



Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?
It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

So hello from the other side (Other side)
I must've called a thousand times (Thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside (outside)
At least, I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
Ooh, anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
Ooh, anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
Ooh, anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
Anymore

Hello from the other side (Other side)
I must've called a thousand times (Thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside (outside)
At least, I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore



Loving you isn't the right thing to do
How can I ever change things that I feel?
If I could, maybe I'd give you my world
How can I when you won't take it from me?
You can go your own way, go your own way
You can call it another lonely day
You can go your own way, go your own way
Tell me why everything turned around
Packing up, shacking up's all you wanna do
If I could, baby, I'd give you my world
Open up, everything's waiting for you

You can go your own way, go your own way
You can call it another lonely day
You can go your own way, go your own way

You can go your own way, go your own way
You can call it another lonely day, another lonely day
You can go your own way, go your own way
You can call it another lonely day

You can go your own way
You can call it another lonely day
You can go your own way



Now if you're feelin' kinda low 'bout the dues you've been payin'
Future's comin' much too slow
And you wanna run but somehow you just keep on stayin'
Can't decide on which way to go
I understand about indecision
But I don't care if I get behind
People living in competition
All I want is to have my peace of mind
Now you're climbing to the top of the company ladder
Hope it doesn't take too long
Can't you see there'll come a day when it won't matter
Come a day when you'll be gone

I understand about indecision
But I don't care if I get behind
People living in competition
All I want is to have my peace of mind
Take a look ahead
Take a look ahead
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Well everybody's got advice they just keep on givin'
Doesn't mean too much to me
Lots of people have to make believe they're livin'
Can't decide who they should be

I understand about indecision
But I don't care if I get behind
People living in competition
All I want is to have my peace of mind
Take a look ahead
Take a look ahead
Look ahead!



One pill makes you larger
And one pill makes you small
And the ones that mother gives you
Don't do anything at all
Go ask Alice
When she's ten feet tall

And if you go chasing rabbits
And you know you're going to fall
Tell 'em a hookah smoking caterpillar
Has given you the call...
Call Alice
When she was just small

When the men on the chessboard
Get up and tell you where to go
And you've just had some kind of mushroom
And your mind is moving low
Go ask Alice
I think she'll know

When logic and proportion
Have fallen sloppy dead
And the White Knight is talking backwards
And the Red Queen's off with her head
Remember what the Dormouse said
Feed your head
Feed your head



I've been driving all night
My hands wet on the wheel
There's a voice in my head that drives my heel
It's my baby calling
Says "I need you here"
And it's half past four and I'm shifting gear

When she's lonely and the longing gets too much
She sends a cable coming in from above
Don't need no phone at all
We've got a thing that's called Radar Love
We've got a wave in the air
Radar Love

The radio's playing some forgotten song
Brenda Lee's "Coming on Strong"
The road has got me hypnotized
And I'm speeding into a new sunrise

When I get lonely and I'm sure I've had enough
She sends her comfort coming in from above
Don't need no letter at all
We've got a thing that's called Radar Love
We've got a line in the sky
Radar Love
No more speed I'm almost there
Gotta keep cool now gotta take care
Last car to pass here I go
And the line of cars drove down real slow
And the radio played that forgotten song
Brenda Lee's "Coming on Strong"
And the newsman sang his same song
One more radar love is gone

When I get lonely and I'm sure I've had enough
She sends her comfort coming in from above
Don't need no letter at all
We've got a thing that's called Radar Love
We've got a line in the sky
Radar Love

We've got a thing that's called Radar Love
We've got a thing that's called Radar Love



Did you see any action?
Did you make any friends?
Would you like some affection
Before I leave again?
I've been walking behind you
Since you've been able to see
There's never been any reason
For you to think about me
Did you have any bad dreams?
Did you break any glass?
Would you be my companion?
Is there even a chance?
You've been talking in circles
Since I've been able to cry
There's never been any reason
For ever telling me why, yeah, yeah
Save my life, I'm going down for the last time
Woman with the sweet lovin', better than a white line
Bring a good feeling ain't had in such a long time
Save my life, I'm going down for the last time
Have you ever been lonely? Do you have any fun?
Do you ever think of me? I'm just no one, yeah
You never give me no answer, you never tell me the truth
There's never been any reason
For me to think about you
There's never been any reason
There's never been any reason, yeah
There's never been any reason
Save my life, I'm going down for the last time
Woman with the sweet lovin', better than a white line
Don't you know she could bring a good feeling
Ain't had in such a long time?
Save my life, I'm going down for the last time
Whoa
Save my life, I'm going down for the last time
Save my life, I'm going down for the last time
Save my life, I'm going down for the last time
Save my life, I'm going down for the last time
Save my life, I'm going down for the last time



The rain is falling through the mist
Of sorrow that surrounded me
The sun could never thaw away
The bliss that lays around me

Let it rain, let it rain
Let your love rain down on me
Let it rain, let it rain
Let it rain, rain, rain

Her life was like a desert flower
Burning in the sun
Until I found the way to love
It's harder said than done

Let it rain, let it rain
Let your love rain down on me
Let it rain, let it rain
Let it rain, rain, rain

Now I know the secret
There is nothing that I lack
If I give my love to you
You'll surely give it back
Let it rain, let it rain
Let your love rain down on me
Let it rain, let it rain
Let it rain, rain, rain
Let it rain, let it rain
Let your love rain down on me
Let it rain, let it rain
Let it rain, rain, rain
Rain, rain, rain, rain
Rain, rain, rain, rain



You're as cold as ice
You're willing to sacrifice our love
You never take advice
Some day, you'll pay the price
I know

I've seen it before, it happens all the time (Ooh-ooh)
You're closing the door, you leave the world behind
You're digging for gold, you're throwing away (Ah, ah)
A fortune in feelings but, some day, you'll pay

You're as cold as ice
You're willing to sacrifice our love
You want paradise
But some day, you'll pay the price
I know

I've seen it before, it happens all the time (Ooh-ooh)
You're closing the door, you leave the world behind
You're digging for gold, you're throwing away (Ah, ah)
A fortune in feelings but, some day, you'll pay
Cold as ice
You know that you are
Cold as ice
As cold as ice to me
Cold as ice

Ooh, ooh, ooh, cold as, cold as ice
You're as cold as ice
You're as cold as ice, cold as ice, I know
You're as cold as ice, yes I know
You're as cold as ice, cold as ice, I know
You're as cold as ice, oh, yes I know
You're as cold as ice, cold as ice, I know
You're as cold as ice, oh, yes I know
You're as cold as ice, cold as ice



Sprawling on the fringes of the city
In geometric order
An insulated border
In between the bright lights
And the far unlit unknown

Growing up it all seems so one-sided
Opinions all provided
The future pre-decided
Detached and subdivided
In the mass production zone
Nowhere is the dreamer or the misfit so alone
(Subdivisions) --
In the high school halls
In the shopping malls
Conform or be cast out
(Subdivisions) --
In the basement bars
In the backs of cars
Be cool or be cast out

Any escape might help to smooth
The unattractive truth
But the suburbs have no charms to soothe
The restless dreams of youth
Drawn like moths we drift into the city
The timeless old attraction
Cruising for the action
Lit up like a firefly
Just to feel the living night

Some will sell their dreams for small desires
Or lose the race to rats
Get caught in ticking traps
And start to dream of somewhere
To relax their restless flight
Somewhere out of a memory
Of lighted streets on quiet nights
(Subdivisions) --
Ihe high school halls
In the shopping malls
Conform or be cast out
(Subdivisions) --
Ihe basement bars
In the backs of cars
Be cool or be cast out
Any escape might help to smooth
The unattractive truth
But the suburbs have no charms to soothe
The restless dreams of youth



You may think I'm foolish
For the foolish things I do
You may wonder how come I love you
When you get on my nerves like you do
Well baby you know you bug me
There ain't no secret 'bout that
Well come on over here and hug me
Baby I'll spill the facts
Well honey it ain't your money
Cause baby I got plenty of that
I love you for your...

Pink Cadillac
Crushed velvet seats
Riding in the back
Oozing down the street
Waving to the girls
Feeling out of sight
Spending all my money
On a Saturday night
Honey I just wonder what you do there in back
Of your pink Cadillac
Pink Cadillac
Well now way back in the Bible
Temptations always come along
There's always somebody tempting
Somebody into doing something they know is wrong
Well they tempt you, man, with silver
And they tempt you, sir, with gold
And they tempt you with the pleasures
That the flesh does surely hold
They say Eve tempted Adam with an apple
But man I ain't going for that
I know it was her...


Now some folks say it's too big
And uses too much gas
Some folks say it's too old
And that it goes too fast
But my love is bigger than a Honda
It's bigger than a Subaru
Hey man there's only one thing
And one car that will do
Anyway we don't have to drive it
Honey we can park it out in back
And have a party in your...



Spent the last year Rocky Mountain way
Couldn't get much higher
Out to pasture, I think it's safe to say
Time to open fire

And we don't need the ladies crying ’cause the story's sad
‘Cause the Rocky Mountain way is better than the way we had
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Rocky mountain way, ooh

Well he's telling us this, he's telling us that, changing it everyday
Say's it doesn't matter
Bases are loaded and Casey's at bat, playing it play by play
It's time to change the batter

And we don't need the ladies crying ’cause the story's sad, uh huh
‘Cause the Rocky Mountain way is better than the way we had
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Rocky mountain way, ooh

And we don't need the ladies crying ’cause the story's sad, oh yeah
‘Cause the Rocky Mountain way is better than the way we had
It's better than the way we had
So much better
So much better
It's so much better
It's so much better
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Rocky Mountain way, ooooh



Yeah...

All is quiet on New Year's Day
A world in white gets underway
I want to be with you
Be with you night and day
Nothing changes on New Year's Day
On New Year's Day

I will be with you again
I will be with you again

Under a blood red sky
A crowd has gathered in black and white
Arms entwined, the chosen few
The newspaper says, says
Say it's true, it's true...
And we can break through
Though torn in two
We can be one

I, I will begin again
I, I will begin again

Oh
Maybe the time is right
Oh, maybe tonight

I will be with you again
I will be with you again

And so we're told this is the golden age
And gold is the reason for the wars we wage
Though I want to be with you
Be with you night and day
Nothing changes
On New Year's Day
On New Year's Day
On New Year's Day



Cold late night, so long ago
When I was not so strong, you know
A pretty man came to me
Never seen eyes so blue
You know I could not run away, it seemed
We'd seen each other in a dream
Seemed like he knew me
He looked right through me, yeah
"Come on home, girl", he said with a smile
"You don't have to love me yet, let's get high awhile
But try to understand
Try to understand
Try, try, try to understand
I'm a magic man"
Winter nights, we sang in tune
Played inside the months of moon
Never think of never
Let this spell last forever
Well, summer lover passed to fall
Tried to realize it all
Mama says she's worried
Growing up in a hurry, yeah
"Come on home, girl", Mama cried on the phone
"Too soon to lose my baby yet, my girl should be at home"
But try to understand
Try to understand
Try, try, try to understand
He's a magic man, Mama
Ah, he's a magic man
"Come on home, girl", he said with a smile
"I cast my spell of love on you, a woman from a child"
But try to understand
Try to understand
Oh, oh, oh
Try, try to understand
Try, try, try to understand
He's a magic man, oh yeah
Ooh, he got the magic hands
"Come on home, girl", he said with a smile
"You don't have to love me yet, let's get high awhile"
But try to understand
Try to understand
Try, try, try to understand
He's a magic man
Yeah, oh



Raven hair and ruby lips
Sparks fly from her fingertips
Echoed voices in the night
She's a restless spirit on an endless flight

Woo hoo, witchy woman
See how high she flies
Woo hoo, witchy woman
She got the moon in her eye

She held me spellbound in the night
Dancing shadows and firelight
Crazy laughter in another room
And she drove herself to madness with a silver spoon

Woo hoo, witchy woman
See how high she flies
Woo hoo, witchy woman
She got the moon in her eye

Ah, oh ah ah (Waahaa)
Ah, oh ah ah (Waahaa)
Well, I know you want a lover
Let me tell you brother
She's been sleeping in the devil's bed
And there's some rumors going round, someone's underground
She can rock you in the night time 'til your skin turns red

Woo hoo, witchy woman
See how high she flies
Woo hoo, witchy woman
She got the moon in her eye



Here come the jesters, 1 2 3
It's all part of my fantasy
I love the music
And I love to see the crowd
Dancing in the aisles
And singin' out loud, yeah

Here come the dancers, one by one
Your momma's callin' but you're having fun
You find your dancin' on the number 9 cloud
Put your hands together now, and sing it out loud

It's all part of my rock and roll fantasy
It's all part of my rock and roll dream
It's all part of my rock and roll fantasy
It's all part of my rock and roll dream

Put out the spotlights, one and all
And let the feelin' get down to your soul
The music's so loud, you can hear the sound
Reaching for the sky, churnin' up the ground
It's all part of my rock and roll fantasy
It's all part of my rock and roll dream
It's all part of my rock and roll fantasy
It's all part of my rock and roll dream

Fantasy, yeah, yeah, yeah...
Fantasy, yeah, yeah, yeah...

Ah, look at all the lonely people!
Ah, look at all the lonely people!
Eleanor Rigby
Picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window
Wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for?

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Father McKenzie
Writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working
Darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there
What does he care?
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Ah, look at all the lonely people!
Ah, look at all the lonely people!
Eleanor Rigby
Died in the church and was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie
Wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved

All the lonely people (Ah, look at all the lonely people!)
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people (Ah, look at all the lonely people!)
Where do they all belong?



Middle of the road
Is trying to find me
I'm standing in the middle of life with my plans behind me
But I got a smile
For everyone I meet
Long as you don't try dragging my bay
Or dropping the bomb on my street
Oh, come on, baby
Get in the road
Come on now
In the middle of the road, yeah
In the middle of the road
You see the darnedest things
Like fat cats driving 'round in jeeps through the city
Wearing big diamond rings and silk suits
Past corrugated tin shacks full up with kids
And man, I don't mean a Hampstead nursery
But when you own a big chunk of the bloody Third World
The babies just come with the scenery
Now come on, baby
Get in the road
Come on now
In the middle of the road, yeah
One
Two
Three
Four
Five
Six
The middle of the road
Is no private cul-de-sac
I can't get from the cab to the curb
Without some little jerk on my back
Don't harass me, can't you tell
I'm going home, I'm tired as hell
I'm not the cat I used to be
I've got a kid, I'm thirty-three, baby
Get in the road
Come on now
In the middle of the road



It’s getting near dawn
When lights close their tired eyes
I’ll soon be with you, my love
To give you my dawn surprise
I’ll be with you, darling, soon
I’ll be with you when the stars start falling

I’ve been waiting so long
To be where I’m going
In the sunshine of your love

I’m with you, my love
The lights shining through on you
Yes, I’m with you, my love
It’s the morning and just we two
I’ll stay with you, darling, now
I’ll stay with you 'til my seas are dried up

I’ve been waiting so long
To be where I’m going
In the sunshine of your love

I’m with you, my love
The lights shining through on you
Yes, I’m with you, my love
It’s the morning and just we two
I’ll stay with you, darling, now
I’ll stay with you 'til my seas are dried up

I’ve been waiting so long
I’ve been waiting so long
I’ve been waiting so long
To be where I’m going
In the sunshine of your love



Don't look back (ooh, a new day is breakin')
It's been too long since I felt this way
I don't mind (ooh, where I get taken)
The road is callin', today is the day
I can see, it took so long just to realize
I'm much too strong not to compromise
Now I see what I am is holding me down
I'll turn it around, oh, yes, I will
I finally see the dawn arrivin'
I see beyond the road I'm drivin'
It's a bright horizon (ooh, and I'm awakin' now)
Oh, I see myself in a brand new way
The sun is shinin' (ooh, the clouds are breakin')
'Cause I can't lose now, there's no game to play
I can tell there's no more time left to criticize
I've seen what I could not recognize
Everything in my life was leading me on
But I can be strong, oh, yes, I can
I finally see the dawn arrivin'
I see beyond the road I'm drivin'
Ooh, far away and left behind, left behind
Oh, the sun is shinin' and I'm on that road
Don't look back (ooh, a new day is breakin')
Oh, It's been so long since I felt this way
I don't mind (ooh, where I get taken)
The road is callin', today is the day
I can see, it took so long just to realize
I'm much too strong not to compromise
Now I see what I am is holding me down
I'll turn it around, oh, yes, I will
I finally see the dawn arrivin'
I see beyond the road I'm drivin'
Oh, far away and left behind
Don't look back
Don't look back
Don't look back
Don't look back



I make my livin' off the evenin' news
Just give me somethin', somethin' I can use
People love it when you lose
They love dirty laundry

Well, I coulda' been an actor, but I wound up here

Can we film the operation? Is the head dead yet?
You know, the boys in the newsroom got a running bet
Get the widow on the set!
We need dirty laundry

You don't really need to find out what's goin' on
You don't really wanna know just how far it's gone
Just leave well enough alone
Eat your dirty laundry

Kick 'em when they're up
Kick 'em when they're down

Dirty little secrets, dirty little lies
We got our dirty little fingers in everybody's pie
We love to cut you down to size

In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head he's had the pleasure to know
And all the people that come and go
Stop and say hello

On the corner is a banker with a motorcar
The little children laugh at him behind his back
And the banker never wears a mac
In the pouring rain
Very strange

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit and meanwhile back

In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen
He likes to keep his fire engine clean
It's a clean machine

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
Four of fish and finger pies
In summer, meanwhile back

Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout
A pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And though she feels as if she's in a play
She is anyway

In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer
We see the banker sitting, waiting for a trim
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain
Very strange

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
Penny Lane



She keeps Moët et Chandon
In her pretty cabinet
"Let them eat cake," she says
Just like Marie Antoinette
A built-in remedy
For Khrushchev and Kennedy (Ooh, ooh)
At anytime an invitation
You can't decline (Ooh, ooh)

Caviar and cigarettes
Well versed in etiquette
Extraordinarily nice

She's a Killer Queen
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
(Pa-pa-pa-pa) Anytime
Ooh
Recommended at the price
Insatiable an appetite
Wanna try?
To avoid complications
She never kept the same address
In conversation
She spoke just like a baroness
Met a man from China
Went down to Geisha Minah (Ooh, ooh)
(Killer, killer, she's a killer Queen)
Then again incidentally
If you're that way inclined

Perfume came naturally from Paris (Naturally)
For cars, she couldn't care less
Fastidious and precise
She's a Killer Queen
Gunpowder, gelatin
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
(Pa-pa-pa-pa)
Anytime

Drop of a hat she's as willing as
Playful as a pussy cat (Ooh)
Then momentarily out of action (Ooh)
Temporarily out of gas (Ta-taaa)
To absolutely drive you wild, wild
She's out to get you
She's a Killer Queen
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam (Pa-pa-pa-ra)
Guaranteed to blow your mind
Anytime
Ooh
Recommended at the price
Insatiable an appetite
Wanna try?
You wanna try .

Sitting on a park bench
Eyeing little girls with bad intent
Snot running down his nose
Greasy fingers smearing shabby clothes
Hey, Aqualung
Drying in the cold sun
Watching as the frilly panties run
Hey, Aqualung
Feeling like a dead duck
Spitting out pieces of his broken luck
Whoa, Aqualung

Sun streaking cold, an old man wandering lonely
Taking time the only way he knows
Leg hurting bad as he bends to pick a dog-end
He goes down to the bog and warms his feet
Feeling alone, the army's up the road
Salvation a la mode and a cup of tea
Aqualung my friend, don't you start away uneasy
You poor old sod, you see, it's only me

Do you still remember
December's foggy freeze?
When the ice that
Clings on to your beard was
Screaming agony (Hey!)
And you snatch your rattling last breaths
With deep-sea-diver sounds
And the flowers bloom like
Madness in the spring
Sun streaking cold, an old man wandering lonely
Taking time the only way he knows
Leg hurting bad as he bends to pick a dog-end
He goes down to the bog and warms his feet
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Feeling alone, the army's up the road
Salvation a la mode and a cup of tea
Aqualung my friend, don't you start away uneasy
You poor old sod, you see, it's only me
Me-me-me-me-me
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh


Dee-dee-dee-dee
Dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee
Dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee
Dee-dee-dee-dee
Aqualung, my friend, don't you start away uneasy
You poor old sod, you see, it's only me

Sitting on a park bench
Eyeing little girls with bad intent
Snot running down his nose
Greasy fingers smearing shabby clothes
Hey, Aqualung

The police in New York City
They chased a boy right through the park
And in a case of mistaken identity
They put a bullet through his heart

Heart breakers with your .44
I wanna tear your world apart
You a heart breaker with your .44
I wanna tear your world a part

A ten-year-old girl on a street corner
Sticking needles in her arm
She died in the dirt of an alleyway
Her mother said she had no chance, no chance

Heart breaker, heart breaker
She stuck the pins right in her heart
Heart breaker, a pain maker
Stole the love right out your heart

Oh yeah, oh yeah
Wanna tear your world apart
Oh yeah, oh yeah
I wanna tear your world apart
Heart breaker, heart breaker
You stole the love right out of my heart
Heart breaker, heart breaker
Wanna tear that world, wanna tear that world

Ah yeah, ah yeah
I wanna tear that world apart
Heart breaker, heart breaker
Stole the love, stole the love
(Doo doo, doo doo doo doo doo doo)
Oh yeah
(Doo doo doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo doo doo)
Oh yeah, oh yeah
(Doo doo, doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo doo doo)
She stuck the pins right in her heart
Oh yeah, you're a heart breaker
(Doo doo, doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo doo doo)
I wanna tear that world apart
(Doo doo, doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo doo doo)

I once had a girl
Or should I say she once had me
She showed me her room
Isn't it good Norwegian wood?
She asked me to stay
And she told me to sit anywhere
So I looked around
And I noticed there wasn't a chair
I sat on a rug biding my time
Drinking her wine
We talked until two and then she said
"It's time for bed"
She told me she worked
In the morning and started to laugh
I told her I didn't
And crawled off to sleep in the bath
And when I awoke I was alone
This bird had flown
So I lit a fire
Isn't it good Norwegian wood?



It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money, but, boy, if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live
If I was a sculptor, heh, but then again, no
Or a man who makes potions in a traveling show
I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song, and this one's for you

And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
Well, a few of the verses, well, they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on
So excuse me forgetting, but these things I do
You see, I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
Anyway, the thing is, what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen
And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

Money, get away
You get a good job with more pay and you're okay
Money, it's a gas
Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash
New car, caviar, four-star daydream
Think I'll buy me a football team

Money, get back
I'm alright, Jack, keep your hands off of my stack
Money, it's a hit
Ah, don't give me that do-goody-good bullshit
I'm in the high-fidelity first class travelling set
And I think I need a Lear jet



Money, it's a crime
Share it fairly, but don't take a slice of my pie
Money, so they say
Is the root of all evil today
But if you ask for a rise, it's no surprise
That they're giving none away
Away, away, away
Away, away, away
Away, ooh...
- Yeah -- (chuckles) -- I was in the right!
- Yes, absolutely in the right!
- I certainly was in the right!
- Yeah, I was definitely in the right; that geezer was cruising for a bruising...
- Yeah
- Why does anyone do anything?
- I don't know, I was really drunk at the time...
- I was just telling him it was in, he could get it in number two. He was asking why it wasn't coming up on fader eleven. After, I was yelling and screaming and telling him why it wasn't coming up on fader eleven. It came to a heavy blow, which sorted the matter out



Ground Control to Major Tom
Ground Control to Major Tom
Take your protein pills and put your helmet on
(Ten) Ground Control (Nine) to Major Tom (Eight, seven)
(Six) Commencing (Five) countdown, engines on
(Four, three, two)
Check ignition (One) and may God's love (Lift off) be with you

This is Ground Control to Major Tom
You've really made the grade
And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear
Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare
This is Major Tom to Ground Control
I'm stepping through the door
And I'm floating in a most peculiar way
And the stars look very different today

For here am I sitting in my tin can
Far above the world
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do

Though I'm past one hundred thousand miles
I'm feeling very still
And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
Tell my wife I love her very much
She knows
Ground Control to Major Tom
Your circuit's dead, there's something wrong
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you-

-Here am I floating 'round my tin can
Far above the moon
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do



Everywhere I hear the sound of marching, charging feet, boy
'Cause summer's here, and the time is right for fighting in the street, boy
Well, what can a poor boy do except to sing for a rock and roll band?

'Cause in sleepy London Town
There's just no place for street fighting man, no

Hey! Think the time is right for a palace revolution
'Cause where I live the game to play is compromise solution
Well, then what can a poor boy do except to sing for a rock and roll band?

'Cause in sleepy London Town
There's just no place for street fighting man, no
Get down

Hey! Said my name is called Disturbance
I'll shout and scream, I'll kill the king, I'll rail at all his servants
Well, then what can a poor boy do except to sing for a rock and roll band?

Because in sleepy London Town
There's just no place for street fighting man, no
Get down



Well, it’s a marvellous night for a moondance
With the stars up above in your eyes
A fantabulous  night to make romance
’Neath the cover of October skies
And all the leaves on the trees are falling
To the sound of the breezes that blow
And I’m trying to please to the calling
Of your heart-strings that play soft and low

You know the night’s magic seems to whisper and hush
You know the soft moonlight seems to shine in your blush

Can I just have one more moondance with you, my love
Can I just make some more romance with you, my love

Well, I want to make love to you tonight
I can’t wait ’til the morning has come
And I know now the time is just right
And straight into my arms you will run
And when you come my heart will be waiting
To make sure that you’re never alone
There and then all my dreams will come true, dear
There and then I will make you my own
And every time I touch you, you just tremble inside
Then I know how much you want me that you can’t hide

Can I just have one more moondance with you
My love
Can I just make some more romance with you, my love


Well, it’s a marvellous night for a moondance
With the stars up above in your eyes

And I’m trying to please to the calling
Of your heart-strings that play soft and low

You know the night’s magic
Seems to whisper and hush
You know the soft moonlight seems to shine
In your blush
Can I just have one more moondance with you, my love
Can I just make some more romance with you, my love

One more moondance with you
In the moonlight
On a magic night
La, la, la, la
In the moonlight
On a magic night
Can’t I just have one more moondance with you

Living on a lighted stage
Approaches the unreal
For those who think and feel
In touch with some reality
Beyond the gilded cage

Cast in this unlikely role
Ill-equipped to act
With insufficient tact
One must put up barriers
To keep oneself intact

Living in the limelight
The universal dream
For those who wish to seem
Those who wish to be
Must put aside the alienation
Get on with the fascination
The real relation
The underlying theme

Living in a fisheye lens
Caught in the camera eye
I have no heart to lie
I can't pretend a stranger
Is a long-awaited friend
All the world's indeed a stage
And we are merely players
Performers and portrayers
Each another's audience
Outside the gilded cage

Living in the limelight
The universal dream
For those who wish to seem
Those who wish to be
Must put aside the alienation
Get on with the fascination
The real relation
The underlying theme

Living in the limelight
The universal dream
For those who wish to seem
Those who wish to be

I'm goin' home
And when I wanna go home
I'm goin' mobile
Well, I'm gonna find a home
And we'll see how it feels
Goin' mobile
Keep me movin'

I can pull up by the curb
I can make it on the road
Goin' mobile
I can stop in any street
And talk with people that we meet
Goin' mobile
Keep me movin'

Out in the woods
Or in the city
It's all the same to me
When I'm drivin' free, the world's my home
When I'm mobile
Hee, hoo!
Beep beep!
Play the tape machine
Make the toast and tea
When I'm mobile
Well I can lay in bed
With only highway ahead
When I'm mobile
Keep me movin'

Keep me movin'
Over 50
Keep me groovin'
Just a hippie gypsy
Come on move now
Movin'
Keep me movin', yeah
Keep me movin', groovin', groovin', yeah
Movin', Yeah
Mobile, mobile, mobile, mobile, ...

I don't care about pollution
I'm an air-conditioned gypsy
That's my solution
Watch the police and the tax man miss me
I'm mobile
Oooooh, yeah, hee!
Mobile, mobile, mobile yeah



Let's Go 7x

Endow, beat the brow, getting cows like Texas
In town, it be foul, getting 12 like Christmas

And a semi automatic with the sound of thunder

If you prayed for my fall you are out of luck-a
And my stomach growl like I'm out of supper
I'm power-hungry, this power-hunger

Drink sewer water right out the gutter

Smooth as potato with an ounce of butter

All the motherfuckers
LET'S GO!

It's early morning, the sun comes out
Last night was shaking and pretty loud
My cat is purring, it scratches my skin
So what is wrong with another sin?
The bitch is hungry, she needs to tell
So give her inches and feed her well
More days to come, new places to go
I've got to leave, it's time for a show

Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane
Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane

My body is burning, it starts to shout
Desire is coming, it breaks out loud
Lust is in cages till storm breaks loose
Just have to make it with someone I choose
The night is calling, I have to go
The wolf is hungry, he runs the show
He's licking his lips, he's ready to win
On the hunt tonight for love at first sting
Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane
(Are you ready, babe?)
Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane
Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane
(Come on, come on, babe!)
Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane

Rock you like a hurricane!

STOP DRAGGING MY HEART AROUND
By Stevie Nicks
Baby you come knocking on my front door
Same old line you used to use before
Just a girl well what am I soposed to do
I didn't know what I was getting into
So you had a little trouble in town
Now you're keeping some demon down
Stop dragging my, stop dragging my
Stop dragging my heart around
It's hard to think about what you wanted
It's hard to think about what you lost
These doors don't have to be the big "get even"
These doors don't have to be anything at all
I know you really want to tell me goodbye
I know you really want to be your own girl
Baby you could never look me in the eye
Yeah you buckle with the weight of the world
Stop dragging my, stop dragging my
Stop dragging my heart around
(break)
Theres people running 'round loose in the world
Ain't got nothing better to do
Make a meal of some bright eyed kid
You need someone looking after you
I know you really want to tell me goodbye
I know you really want to be your own girl
Baby you could never look me in the eye
Yeah you buckle with the weight of the world
Stop dragging my, stop dragging my
Stop dragging my heart around
Stop dragging my heart around
Stop dragging my heart around
Stop dragging my heart around
Stop dragging my heart around

You know that it would be untrue
You know that I would be a liar
If I was to say to you
Girl, we couldn't get much higher

Come on, baby, light my fire
Come on, baby, light my fire
Try to set the night on fire

The time to hesitate is through
No time to wallow in the mire
Try, now we can only lose
And our love become a funeral pyre

Come on, baby, light my fire
Come on, baby, light my fire
Try to set the night on fire
Yeah...

Seems like yesterday, but it was long ago
Janey was lovely, she was the queen of my nights
There in darkness with the radio playin' low, and

And the secrets that we shared, the mountains that we moved
Caught like a wildfire out of control
'Til there was nothing left to burn and nothing left to prove

And I remember what she said to me
How she swore that it never would end
I remember how she held me, oh so tight
Wish I didn't know now what I didn't know then

Against the wind
We were running against the wind
We were young and strong
We were running against the wind

And the years rolled slowly past, and I found myself alone
Surrounded by strangers I thought were my friends
Found myself further and further from my home and I
I guess I lost my way, there were oh so many roads
I was livin' to run and runnin' to live
Never worried about payin' or even how much I owe

Movin' eight miles a minute for months at a time
Breakin' all of the rules that would bend
I began to find myself searchin'
Searchin' for shelter again and again

Against the wind
Little somethin' against the wind
I found myself seekin' shelter against the wind

2:36 - 3:19

Well, those drifters days are past me now
I've got so much more to think about
Deadlines and commitments
What to leave in, what to leave out

Against the wind
I'm still running against the wind
I'm older now but still running against the wind
Well, I'm older now and still running
Against the wind
(Against the wind)
(Against the wind)
I'm still running
(Against the wind)
I'm still running against the wind
(Against the wind)
I'm still running
(Against the wind)
I'm still running against the wind
(Against the wind)
Still running
(Against the wind)
Running against the wind, running against the wind
(Against the wind)
See the young man run
(Against the wind)
Watch the young man run
(Against the wind)
Watch the young man runnin'
(Against the wind)
He'll be runnin' against the wind
(Against the wind)
Let the cowboys ride
(Against the wind)
Mm
(Against the wind)
Let the cowboys ride
(Against the wind)
They'll be ridin' against the wind
(Against the wind)
Against the wind
(Against the wind)
Ridin' against the wind
(Against the wind)
(Against the wind)
Ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride
(Against the wind)
(Against the wind)



Want to tell you about the girl I love
My, she looks so fine
She's the only one that I been dreaming of
Maybe someday she will be all mine
I want to tell her that I love her so
I thrill with her every touch
I need to tell her she's the only one I really love

I got a woman, want to ball all day
I got a woman, she won't be true, no
I got a woman, stay drunk all the time
I said, I got a little woman, and she won't be true

On Sunday morning, when we go down to church
See the menfolk standing in line
Say they come to pray to the Lord
When my little girl looks so fine
In the evening, when the sun is sinking low
Everybody's with the one they love
I walk the town
Keep a-searching all around
Looking for my street corner girl
I got a woman, want to ball all day, yeah
I got a woman, she won't be true, no, no
I got a woman, stay drunk all the time
I said, I got a little woman, and she won't be true

In the bars, with the men who play guitars
Singing, drinking, and remembering the times
My little lover does a midnight shift
She followed around all of the time
I guess there's just one thing a-left for me to do
Going to pack my bags and move on my way
'Cause I got a worried mind
Sharing what I thought was mine
Going to leave her where the guitars play

I got a woman, she won't be true, no, no
I got a woman, want to ball all day, yeah, yeah, naw, naw
I got a woman, stay drunk all the time
I got a little woman, and she won't be true

Ooh
Oh yeah
Uh-huh, ah!

Jump back, what's that sound?

Hot shoe, burning down the avenue
Model citizen, zero discipline

Don't you know she's coming home to me?
You'll lose her in the turn
I'll get her, ah!

Panama
Panama
Panama
Panama

Ain't nothin' like it, her shiny machine
Got the feel for the wheel, keep the moving parts clean
Hot shoe, burning down the avenue
Out an on-ramp coming through my bedroom
Don't you know she's coming home to me?
You'll lose her in the turn
I'll get her, ah!
Uh-oh

Panama
Panama, ow
Panama, ah
Panama, oh-oh-oh-oh
Woo!


Ah
Yeah, we're running a little bit hot tonight
I can barely see the road from the heat coming off it, I say
I reach down between my legs and
Ease the seat back

She's blinding, I'm flying
Right behind in rearview mirror now
Got the fearing, power steering
Pistons popping, ain't no stopping now
Panama
Panama
Panama
Panama, oh-oh-oh-oh
Panama
Panama, oh-oh-oh-oh
Panama

So I've come here to give you a hand
And lead you into the promised land, so
Come on and take a free ride (free ride)
Come on and stand here by my side

We gotta do better, it's time to begin
You know all the answers must come from within, so
Come on and take a free ride (free ride)
Comе on and stand here by my side
Comе on and take a free ride

So let me live my life the way I want to
Yeah, sing on brother, play on drummer



Taking my time
Choosin' my line
Tryin' to decide what to do
Looks like my stop
Don't wanna get off
Got myself hung up on you

Seems to me
You don't want to talk about it
Seems to me
You just turn your pretty head and walk away

Places I've known
Things that I'm growin'
Don't taste the same without you
I got myself in
The worst mess I've been
And I find myself startin' ta doubt you

Seems to me
Talk all night, here comes the mornin'
Seems to me
You just forget what we said
And greet the day

Seems to me
You don't wanna talk about it
Seems to me
You just turn your pretty head and walk away

I've got ta cool myself down
Stompin' around
Thinkin' some words I can't name ya
Meet ya half way
Got nothin' to say
Still I don't s'pose I can blame ya

Seems to me
You don't want to talk about it
Seems to me
You just turn your pretty head and walk away

Walk away



I can't believe the news today
Oh, I can't close my eyes and make it go away

How long, how long must we sing this song?
How long? How long?
'Cause tonight, we can be as one
Tonight

Broken bottles under children's feet
Bodies strewn across the dead end street
But I won't heed the battle call
It puts my back up
Puts my back up against the wall

Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Alright, let's go!
And the battle's just begun
There's many lost, but tell me, who has won?
The trench is dug within our hearts
And mothers, children, brothers, sisters
Torn apart

Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Sunday, Bloody Sunday

How long
How long must we sing this song?
How long, how long?
'Cause tonight, we can be as one
Tonight

Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Come get some!

Wipe the tears from your eyes
Wipe your tears away
Oh, wipe your tears away
Oh, wipe your tears away
Oh, wipe your bloodshot eyes
Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Sunday, Bloody Sunday

And it's true, we are immune
When fact is fiction and TV reality
And today, the millions cry
We eat and drink while tomorrow, they die
The real battle just begun
To claim the victory Jesus won
On—

Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Sunday, Bloody Sunday



Angie, Angie
When will those clouds all disappear?
Angie, Angie
Where will it lead us from here?
With no loving in our souls
And no money in our coats
You can't say we're satisfied
But Angie, Angie
You can't say we never tried
Angie, you're beautiful, yeah
But ain't it time we said goodbye?
Angie, I still love you
Remember all those nights we cried?
All the dreams we held so close
Seemed to all go up in smoke
Let me whisper in your ear
Angie, Angie
Where will it lead us from here?

Oh, Angie, don't you weep
All your kisses still taste sweet
I hate that sadness in your eyes
But Angie, Angie
Ain't it time we said goodbye? Yeah
With no loving in our souls
And no money in our coats
You can't say were satisfied
But Angie, I still love you, baby
Everywhere I look, I see your eyes
There ain't a woman that comes close to you
Come on, baby, dry your eyes
But Angie, Angie
Ain't it good to be alive?
Angie, Angie
They can't say we never tried



Well, on a train, I met a dame
She rather handsome, we kinda looked the same
She was pretty, from New York City
I'm walking down that old fair lane
I'm in heat, I'm in love
But I just couldn't tell her so

I said, train kept a-rolling all night long
Train kept a-rolling all night long
Train kept a-rolling all night long
Train kept a-rolling all night long
With a "heave!", and a ho!
But I just couldn't tell her so, no, no, no

Well, get along, sweet little woman get along
On your way, get along, sweet little woman get along
On your way
I'm in heat, I'm in love
But I just couldn't tell her so, no, no, no

Well, on a train, I met a dame

Well, get along, sweet little woman get along
On your way, get along, sweet little woman get along
On your way
I'm in heat, I'm in love
But I just couldn't tell her so, no, no, no

Well, we made a stop in Albuquerque
She must have thought I was a real cool jerk
Got off the train, and put her hands up
Looking so good I couldn't let her go
But I just couldn't tell her so

I said, train kept a-rolling all night long
Train kept a-rolling all night long
Train kept a-rolling all night long
Train kept a-rolling all night long
I'm in heat, I'm in love
But I just couldn't tell her



Well the dawn was coming
Heard him ringing on my bell
He said, My name's the teacher
That is what I call myself
And I have a lesson
That I must impart to you
It's an old expression
But I must insist it's true
Jump up, look around
Find yourself some fun
No sense in sitting there hating everyone
No man's an island and his castle isn't home
The nest is full of nothing when the bird has flown
So I took a journey
Threw my world into the sea
With me went the teacher
Who found fun instead of me
Hey man, what's the plan, what was that you said?
Sun-tanned, drink in hand, lying there in bed
I try to socialize but I can't seem to find
What I was looking for, got something on my mind
Then the teacher told me
It had been a lot of fun
Thanked me for his ticket
And all that I had done
Hey man, what's the plan, what was that you said?
Sun-tanned, drink in hand, lying there in bed
I try to socialize but I can't seem to find
What I was looking for, got something on my mind

{Intro}
{Verse 1}
You've got to change your evil ways, baby
Before I stop lovin' you
You've got to change, baby
And every word that I say is true
{Chorus 1}
You got me runnin' and hidin' all over town
You got me sneakin' and a-peepin' and runnin' you down
This can't go on, Lord knows you got to change, baby
Baby
{Verse 2}
When I come home, baby
My house is dark and my pots are cold
You're hangin' round, baby
With Jean and Joan and-a who knows who
{Chorus 2}
I'm gettin' tired of waitin' and foolin' around
I'll find somebody who won't make me feel like a clown
This can't go on, Lord knows you got to change
{Bridge}
{Verse 2}
When I come home, baby
My house is dark and my pots are cold
You're hangin' round, baby
With Jean and Joan and-a who knows who
{Chorus 3}
I'm gettin' tired of waitin' and foolin' around
I'll find somebody who won't make me feel like a clown
This can't go on, yeh yeh yeh
{Outro}



Thinkin' 'bout the times you drove in my car
Thinkin' that I might have drove you too far
And I'm thinkin' 'bout the love that you laid on my table
I told you not to wander 'round in the dark
I told you 'bout the swans that they live in the park
Then I told you 'bout our kid, now he's married to Mabel

Yes, I told you that the light goes up and down
Don't you notice how the wheel goes 'round?
And you'd better pick yourself up from the ground
Before they bring the curtain down
Yes, before they bring the curtain down, woo-ooh
Get up, get up, get up
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Talkin' 'bout a girl that looks quite like you
She didn't have the time to wait in the queue
She cried away her life since she fell off the cradle



She saw the look in his eyes
And she knew better
He wanted her tonight, ah
And it was now or never
He made her feel so sad

Oh, whoa, whoa, Jamie's cryin'
Oh, whoa, whoa, Jamie's cryin'

Now Jamie wouldn't say alright
She knew he'd forget her
And so they said goodnight, ooh
And now he's gone forever

She wants to send him a letter, a-yeah yeah
A-just to try to make herself feel better
It said "Gimme (gimme a call sometime")
But she knows what that'll get her

Oh, whoa, whoa, Jamie's cryin'
Oh, whoa, whoa, Jamie's cryin'
Now Jamie's been in love before (ahh)
And she knows what love is for (ahh)
It should mean, a little, a little more (ahh)
Than one night stands, whoo

She wants to send him a letter, a-yeah yeah
Just to try to make herself feel better
It said "Gimme (gimme a call sometime")
But she knows what that'll get her

Oh, whoa, whoa, Jamie's cryin'

Oh, whoa, whoa, Jamie's cryin'
Oh, whoa, whoa, Jamie's cryin'
Oh, whoa, whoa, Jamie's cryin'
Oh, whoa, whoa, Jamie's cryin'



Nobody knows where you are, how near or how far
Shine on you crazy diamond
Pile on many more layers and i'll be joining you there
Shine on you crazy diamond
And we'll bask in the shadow of yesterday's triumph
And sail on the steel breeze
Come on you boy child, you winner and loser
Come on you miner for truth and delusion, and shine!



It's late in the evening, she's wondering what clothes to wear
She puts on her make-up and brushes her long blonde hair
And then she asks me, "Do I look all right?"
And I say, "Yes, you look wonderful tonight"

We go to a party and everyone turns to see
This beautiful lady that's walking around with me
And then she asks me "Do you feel all right?"
And I say, "Yes, I feel wonderful tonight"

I feel wonderful because I see
The love light in your eyes
And the wonder of it all
Is that you just don't realize how much I love you

It's time to go home now and I've got an aching head
So I give her the car keys and she helps me to bed
And then I tell her, as I turn out the light
I say, "My darling, you were wonderful tonight
Oh my darling, you were wonderful tonight"



Rhiannon rings like a bell through the night
And wouldn't you love to love her?
Takes to the sky like a bird in flight
And who will be her lover?

All your life you've never seen a woman
Taken by the wind
Would you stay if she promised you heaven?
Will you ever win?

She is like a cat in the dark
And then she is the darkness
She rules her life like a fine skylark
And when the sky is starless
Once in a million years a lady like her rises
Oh no, Rhiannon, you cry, but she's gone
Your life knows no answer, your life knows no answer

All your life you've never seen a woman
Taken by the wind
Would you stay if she promised you heaven?
Will you ever win?
Will you ever win?
Rhiannon
Rhiannon
Rhiannon
Rhiannon

She rings like a bell through the night
And wouldn't you love to love her?
She rules her life like a bird in flight
And who will be her lover?

All your life you've never seen a woman
Taken by the wind
Would you stay if she promised you heaven?
Will you ever win?
Will you ever win?

Rhiannon
Rhiannon
Rhiannon
Taken by, taken by the sky
Taken by, taken by the sky
Taken by, taken by the sky
Dreams unwind
Love's a state of mind
Dreams unwind
Love's a state of mind



Living easy, living free
Season ticket on a one way ride
Asking nothing, leave me be
Taking everythin' in my stride
Don't need reason, don't need rhyme
Ain't nothing I’d rather do
Goin' down, party time
My friends are gonna be there too, yeah

I'm on the highway to hell
On the highway to hell
Highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell

No stop signs, speed limit
Nobody's gonna slow me down
Like a wheel, gonna spin it
Nobody's gonna mess me around
Hey Satan, payin' my dues
Playing in a rocking band
Hey mama, look at me
I'm on the way to the promised land
Woo!
I'm on the highway to hell
Highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell
Highway to hell

Don't stop me
Heh, heh!


I'm on the highway to hell
On the highway to hell
Highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell
(Highway to hell) I'm on the highway to hell
(Highway to hell) Highway to hell
(Highway to hell) Highway to hell
(Highway to hell)

And I'm going down
All the way
I'm on the highway to hell



Oh, come on, come on, come on, come on

Didn't I make you feel like you were the only man? Yeah
An' didn't I give you nearly everything that a woman possibly can?
Honey, you know I did

And, and each time I tell myself that I, well I think I've had enough
But I'm gonna, gonna show you baby, that a woman can be tough
I want you to come on, come on, come on, come on and take it

Take another little piece of my heart now, baby
Oh, oh, break it
Break another little bit of my heart now, darling, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, have a
Have another little piece of my heart now, baby
Well you know you got it, if it makes you feel good
Oh, yes indeed

You're out on the streets looking good
And baby deep down in your heart I guess you know that it ain't right
Never, never, never, never, never, never hear me when I cry at night
Babe and I cry all the time
But each time I tell myself that I, well I can't stand the pain
But when you hold me in your arms, I'll sing it once again
I'll say come on, come on, come on, come on and take it

Take another little piece of my heart now, baby
Oh, oh, break it
Break another little bit of my heart now, darling, yeah
Oh, oh, have a
Have another little piece of my heart now, baby
Well you know you got it, child, if it makes you feel good
I need you to come on, come on, come on, come on and take it
Take another little piece of my heart now, baby
Oh, oh, break it
Break another little bit of my heart, now darling, yeah, c'mon now
Oh, oh, have a
Have another little piece of my heart now, baby
You know you got it -
Waaaaah!

Take it, take another little piece of my heart now, baby
Oh, oh, break it
Break another little bit of my heart, now darling, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, have a
Have another little piece of my heart now, baby, hey
You know you got it, child, if it makes you feel good



Though I've tried before to tell her
Of the feelings I have for her in my heart
Every time that I come near her
I just lose my nerve as I've done from the start

Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she does just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on

Do I have to tell the story
Of a thousand rainy days since we first met
It's a big enough umbrella
But it's always me
That ends up getting wet

Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she does just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on

I resolved to call her up
A thousand times a day
And ask her if she'll marry me
In some old fashioned way
But my silent fears have gripped me
Long before I reach the phone
Long before my tongue has tripped me
Must I always be alone?
Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she does just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on

Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she does just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on

Every little thing, every little thing
Every, every little thing
Every little, every little, every little
Every little thing she does
Every little thing she does
Every little thing she does
Every little thing she does
That she does is magic
Eee oh oh, eee oh oh
Eee oh oh, eee oh oh
Eee oh oh, eee oh oh
Eee oh oh, eee oh oh
Eee oh oh, eee oh oh
Eee oh oh, eee oh oh
Eee oh oh, eee oh oh
Eee oh oh, eee oh oh
Every little thing
Every little thing
Every little thing
She does is magic, magic, magic
Magic, magic, magic
Ey oh, yo oh
Eee oh oh oh oh oh
Do I have to tell the story
Of a thousand rainy days since we first met
It's a big enough umbrella
But it's always me
That ends up getting wet



When you wake up in the morning
And the light is hurt your head
The first thing you do
When you get up out of bed
Is hit that streets a-runnin'
And try to beat the masses
And go get yourself some cheap sunglasses
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

Spied a little thing and
I followed her all night
In a funky fine Levi's and her
Sweater's kind of tight
She had a west coast strut
That was sweet as molasses
But what really knocked
Me out was her cheap sunglasses
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

Now go out and get yourself
Some thick black frames
With the glass so dark
They won't even know your name
And the choice is up to you
Cause they come in two classes
Rhinestone shades
And cheap sunglasses
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah



Really don't mind if you sit this one out
My word's but a whisper, your deafness a shout
I may make you feel but I can't make you think
Your sperm's in the gutter, your love's in the sink
So you ride yourselves over the fields
And you make all your animal deals
And your wise men don't know how it feels

To be thick as a brick

And the sand-castle virtues are all swept away
In the tidal destruction, the moral melee
The elastic retreat rings the close of play
As the last wave uncovers the newfangled way
But your new shoes are worn at the heels
And your suntan does rapidly peel
And your wise men don't know how it feels

To be thick as a brick
And the love that I feel
Is so far away
I'm a bad dream
That I just had today
And you shake your head
And say it's a shame

Spin me back down the years
And the days of my youth
Draw the lace and black curtains
And shut out the whole truth
Spin me down the long ages
Let them sing the song
See there! A son is born
And we pronounce him fit to fight
There are black-heads on his shoulders
And he pees himself in the night
We'll make a man of him
Put him to a trade
Teach him to play Monopoly
And how to sing in the rain



The Poet and the Painter
Casting shadows on the water
As the sun plays on the infantry
Returning from the sea
The do-er and the thinker
No allowance for the other
As the failing light illuminates
The mercenary's creed
The home fire burning
The kettle almost boiling
But the master of the house
Is far away
The horses stamping
Their warm breath clouding
In the sharp and frosty morning
Of the day
And the poet lifts his pen
While the soldier sheaths his sword
And the youngest of the family
Is moving with authority
Building castles by the sea
He dares the tardy tide
To wash them all aside, oh


The cattle quietly grazing
At the grass down by the river
Where the swelling mountain water
Moves onward to the sea
The builder of the castles
Renews the age-old purpose
And contemplates the milking girl
Whose offer is his need
The young men of the household
Have all gone into service
And are not to be expected
For a year
The innocent young master
Thoughts moving ever faster
Has formed the plan
To change the man he seems
And the poet sheaths his pen
While the soldier lifts his sword

And the oldest of the family
Is moving with authority
Coming from across the sea
He challenges the son
Who puts him to the run


What do you do when the old man's gone
Do you want to be him?
And your real self sings the song
Do you want to free him?
No one to help you get up steam
And the whirlpool turns you way off-beam


I've come down from the upper class
To mend your rotten ways
My father was a man-of-power
Whom everyone obeyed

So come on all you criminals!
I've got to put you straight
Just like I did with my old man
Twenty years too late


Your bread and water's going cold
Your hair is too short and neat
I'll judge you all and make damn sure
That no-one judges me


You curl your toes in fun
As you smile at everyone
You meet the stares, you're unaware
That your doings aren't done
And you laugh most ruthlessly
As you tell us what not to be
But how are we supposed to see
Where we should run?

I see you shuffle in the courtroom with
Your rings upon your fingers
And your downy little sidies
And your silver-buckle shoes
Playing at the hard case
You follow the example
Of the comic-paper idol
Who lets you bend the rules

So, come on ye childhood heroes!
Won't you rise up from the pages
Of your comic-books, your super crooks
And show us all the way
Well! Make your will and testament
Won't you join your local government?
We'll have Superman for president
Let Robin save the day

You put your bet on number one
And it comes up every time
The other kids have all backed down
And they put you first in line
And so you finally ask yourself
Just how big you are
And you take your place in a wiser world
Of bigger motor cars
And you wonder who to call on

So! Where the hell was Biggles
When you needed him last Saturday?
And where were all the sportsmen
Who always pulled you though?
They're all resting down in Cornwall
Writing up their memoirs
For a paper-back edition
Of the Boy Scout Manual




See there! A man is born
And we pronounce him fit for peace
There's a load lifted from his shoulders
With the discovery of his disease
We'll take a child from him
Put it to the test
Teach it to be a wise man
And how to fool the rest


We will be geared to the average, rather than the exceptional
God is an overwhelming responsibility
We walked through the maternity ward
And saw 218 babies wearing nylons
It says here that cats are on the upgrade
Upgrade? Hipgrave
Oh, Mac

In the clear white circles of morning wonder
I take my place with the lord of the hills
And the blue-eyed soldiers stand slightly discoloured
In neat little rows sporting canvas frills
With their jock-straps pinching, they slouch to attention
While queuing for sarnies at the office canteen
Saying: "How's your granny?" and good old Ernie
He coughed up a tenner on a premium bond win


The legends worded in the ancient tribal hymn
Lie cradled in the seagull's call
And all the promises they made
Are ground beneath the sadist's fall

The poet and the wise man stand
Behind the gun, behind the gun
And signal for the crack of dawn
Light the sun, light the sun

Do you believe in the day?
Do you believe in the day?

The Dawn Creation of the Kings
Has begun, has begun
Soft Venus, lonely maiden brings
The ageless one, the ageless one

Do you believe in the day?
Do you believe in the day?

The fading hero has returned
To the night, to the night
And fully pregnant with the day
Wise men endorse the poet's sight

Do you believe in the day?
Do you believe in the day?



Let me tell you the tales of your life
Of your love and the cut of the knife
The tireless oppression, the wisdom instilled
The desire to kill or be killed
Well, let me sing of the losers who lie
In the street as the last bus goes by
The pavements are empty: the gutters run red
While the fool toasts his god in the sky

So come all ye young men who are building castles!
Kindly state the time of the year
And join your voices in a hellish chorus
Mark the precise nature of your fear

Let me help you pick up your dead
As the sins of the father are fed
With the blood of the fools and the thoughts of the wise and
From the pan under your bed
Well, let me make you a present of song
As the wise man breaks wind and is gone
While the fool with the hour-glass is cooking his goose
And the nursery rhyme winds along

So! Come all ye young men who are building castles!
Kindly state the time of the year
And join your voices in a hellish chorus
Mark the precise nature of your fear
See! The summer lightning casts its bolts upon you
And the hour of judgement draweth near
Would you be the fool stood in his suit of armour
Or the wiser man who rushes clear


So, come on ye childhood heroes!
Won't you rise up from the pages
Of your comic-books, your super crooks
And show us all the way
Well! Make your will and testament
Won't you join your local government?
We'll have Superman for president
Let Robin save the day

So! Where the hell was Biggles
When you needed him last Saturday?
And where were all the sportsmen
Who always pulled you though?
They're all resting down in Cornwall
Writing up their memoirs
For a paper-back edition
Of the Boy Scout Manual

So you ride yourselves over the fields
And you make all your animal deals
And your wise men don't know how it feels

To be thick as a brick



This is the end
Beautiful friend
This is the end
My only friend, the end

Of our elaborate plans, the end
Of everything that stands, the end
No safety or surprise, the end
I'll never look into your eyes again

Can you picture what will be?
So limitless and free
Desperately in need
Of some stranger's hand
In a desperate land

Lost in a Roman wilderness of pain
And all the children are insane
All the children are insane
Waiting for the summer rain, yeah
There's danger on the edge of town
Ride the King's Highway, baby
Weird scenes inside the gold mine
Ride the highway west, baby
Ride the snake, ride the snake
To the lake, the ancient lake, baby
The snake, he's long, seven miles
Ride the snake
He's old and his skin is cold
The west is the best
The west is the best
Get here and we'll do the rest
The blue bus is calling us
The blue bus is calling us
Driver, where you taking us?

The killer awoke before dawn
He put his boots on
He took a face from the ancient gallery
And he walked on down the hall
He went into the room where his sister lived, and then he
Paid a visit to his brother, and then he
He walked on down the hall, and
And he came to a door
And he looked inside
"Father?" "Yes, son?" "I want to kill you"
"Mother? I want to..."
Come on baby, take a chance with us
Come on baby, take a chance with us
Come on baby, take a chance with us
And meet me at the back of the blue bus
Doin' a blue rug, on a blue bus, doin' a
Come on yeah
Fuck, fuck-ah, yeah
Fuck, fuck
Fuck, fuck
Fuck, fuck, fuck yeah!
Come on baby, come on
Fuck me baby, fuck yeah
Woah
Fuck, fuck, fuck, yeah!
Fuck, yeah, come on baby
Fuck me baby, fuck fuck
Woah, woah, woah, yeah
Fuck yeah, do it, yeah
Come on!
Huh, huh, huh, huh, yeah
Alright
Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill

This is the end
Beautiful friend
This is the end
My only friend, the end
It hurts to set you free
But you'll never follow me
The end of laughter and soft lies
The end of nights we tried to die
This is the end



I found a picture of you, oh oh oh oh
What hijacked my world that night
To a place in the past we've been cast out of? oh oh oh oh
Now we're back in the fight

We're back on the train
Oh, back on the chain gang

A circumstance beyond our control, oh oh oh oh
The phone, the TV, and the news of the world
Got in the house like a pigeon from hell, oh oh oh oh
Threw sand in our eyes and descended like flies

Put us back on the train
Oh, back on the chain gang

The powers that be that force us to live like we do
Bring me to my knees when I see what they've done to you
But I'll die as I stand here today knowing that deep in my heart
They'll fall to ruin one day for making us part
I found a picture of you, oh oh oh oh
Those were the happiest days of my life
Like a break in the battle was your part, oh oh oh oh
In the wretched life of a lonely heart

Now we're back on the train
Oh, back on the chain gang



Lady, when you're with me I'm smiling
Give me all your love
Your hands build me up when I'm sinking
Touch me and my troubles all fade

Lady, from the moment I saw you
Standing all alone
You gave all the love that I needed
So shy, like a child who had grown

You're my lady of the morning
Love shines in your eyes
Sparkling, clear and lovely
You're my lady

Lady, turn me on when I'm lonely
Show me all your charms
Evenings when you lay down beside me
Take me gently into your arms

You're my Lady of the morning
Love shines in your eyes
Sparkling, clear and lovely
You're my lady
Lady of the morning
Love shines in your eyes
Sparkling, clear and lovely
You're my
Lady



Should I fall out of love, my fire in the light
To chase a feather in the wind
Within the glow that weaves a cloak of delight
There moves a thread that has no end

For many hours and days that pass ever soon
The tides have caused the flame to dim
At last the arm is straight, the hand to the loom
Is this to end or just begin?

All of my love, all of my love
All of my love to you, now
All of my love, all of my love
Oh, all of my love to you, now

The cup is raised, the toast is made yet again
One voice is clear above the din
Proud Arianne one word, my will to sustain
For me, the cloth once more to spin
Oh, all of my love, all of my love
Oh, all of my love for you now
All of my love, all of my love, yes
All of my love to you, child


Yours is the cloth, mine is the hand that sews time
His is the force that lies within
Ours is the fire, all the warmth we can find
He is a feather in the wind

Oh, all of my love, all of my love
Oh, all of my love to you, now
All of my love, oh yes
All of my love to you
All of my love, all of my love
All of my love!
Sometimes, sometimes
Hey hey hey hey, ooooh yeah
It's all all all
All of my love, all of my love
All of my love to you, now
All of my love, all of my love
All of my love to you, now
I get a little bit lonely
Just a little, just a little
Just a little bit lonely
Just a little bit lonely



So you think you're a Romeo
Playing a part in a picture-show
Well, take the long way home
Take the long way home

Cause you're the joke of the neighborhood
Why should you care if you're feeling good
Well, take the long way home
Take the long way home

There are times that you feel you're part of the scenery
All the greenery
Is comin' down, boy
And then your wife seems to think you're part of the furniture
Oh, it's peculiar
She used to be so nice

When lonely days turn to lonely nights
You take a trip to the city lights
And take the long way home
Take the long way home
You never see what you wanna see
Forever playing to the gallery
You take the long way home
Take the long way home

And when you're up on the stage it's so unbelievable
Oh, unforgettable
How they adore you
But then your wife seems to think you're losing your sanity
Oh, calamity
Is there no way out?
Oh yeah!


Does it feel that your life's become a catastrophe?
Oh, it has to be
For you to grow, boy
When you look through the years and see what you could have been
Oh, what you might have been
If you would had more time

So when the day comes to settle down
Who's to blame if you're not around?
You took the long way home
You took the long way home
You took the long way home
Do it again
You took the long way home
You took the long way home
Oh yah!
You took the long way home
You took the long way home
Ooh, yeah
You took the long way home
Aah aah aah aah
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Aah aah aah aah

Long way home
Long way home
Long way home
Long way home
Long way home
Long way home
Long way home



I was talking with a friend of mine
Said a woman had hurt his pride
Told him that she loved him so, and
Turned around and let him go
Then he said, "You better watch your step
Or you're gonna get hurt yourself
Someone's gonna tell you lies
Cut you down to size"

Don't do me like that
Don't do me like that
What if I love you, baby?
Don't do me like that
Don't do me like that
Don't do me like that
Someday I might need you, baby
Don't do me like that

Listen, honey, can you see?
Baby, you would bury me
If you were in the public eye
Giving someone else a try
And you know you better watch your step
Or you're gonna get hurt yourself
Someone's gonna tell you lies
Cut you down to size
Don't do me like that
Don't do me like that
What if I love you, baby?
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't do me like that
Don't do me like that
What if I need you, baby?
Don't do me like that

'Cause somewhere deep down inside
Someone is saying
"Love doesn't last that long"
I got this feeling inside
Night and day
And now I can't take it no more

Listen, honey, can you see?
Baby, you would bury me
If you were in the public eye
Giving someone else a try
And you know you better watch your step
Or you're gonna get hurt yourself
Someone's gonna tell you lies
Cut you down to size
Don't do me like that
Don't do me like that
What if I love you, baby?
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't do me like that
Don't do me like that
I just might need you, honey
Don't do me like that
Wait!
Don't do me like that
Don't do me like that
Baby, baby, baby
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't do me like that
Don't do me like that
Baby, baby, baby
Oh, oh, oh!



I breakdown in the middle and lose my thread
No one can understand a word that I say
When I breakdown just a little and lose my head
Nothing I try to do can work the same way

Any time it happened I'd get over it
With a little help from all my friends
Anybody else could see what's wrong with me
But they walk away and just pretend
When I breakdown

I breakdown in the middle and lose my thread
No one can understand a word that I say
When I breakdown just a little and lose my head
Nothing I try to do can work the same way

Where are all the friends who used to talk to me?
All they ever told me was good news
People that I've never seen are kind to me
Is it any wonder I'm confused?
When I breakdown, when I breakdown

Freedom, freedom, we will not obey
Freedom, freedom, take the wall away
(Take the wall away)
Freedom, freedom, we will not obey
Freedom, freedom, take them all away
Where are all my friends?
(I'm so confused)
(Take the wall away, take the wall away)
(Won't somebody help me)



I see the bad moon arising
I see trouble on the way
I see earthquakes and lightnin'
I see bad times today
Don't go around tonight
Well, it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise
I hear hurricanes a blowing
I know the end is coming soon
I fear rivers over flowing
I hear the voice of rage and ruin
Don't go around tonight
Well, it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise
All right!
Hope you got your things together
Hope you are quite prepared to die
Looks like we're in for nasty weather
One eye is taken for an eye
Don't go around tonight
Well, it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise
Don't go around tonight
Well, it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise



People are strange when you're a stranger
Faces look ugly when you're alone
Women seem wicked when you're unwanted
Streets are uneven when you're down

When you're strange
Faces come out of the rain
When you're strange
No one remembers your name
When you're strange
When you're strange
When you're strange

People are strange when you're a stranger
Faces look ugly when you're alone
Women seem wicked when you're unwanted
Streets are uneven when you're down

When you're strange
Faces come out of the rain
When you're strange
No one remembers your name
When you're strange
When you're strange
When you're strange
Alright, yeah
When you're strange
Faces come out of the rain
When you're strange
No one remembers your name
When you're strange
When you're strange
When you're strange



Let me take you to the movie
Can I take you to the show?
Let me be yours ever truly
Can I make your garden grow?

From the houses of the holy
We can watch the white doves go
From the door comes Satan's daughter
And it only goes to show

You know

There's an angel on my shoulder
In my hand a sword of gold
Let me wander in your garden
And the seeds of love I'll sow

You know

So the world is spinning faster
Are you dizzy when you stall??
Let the music be your master
Will you heed the master's call?
Oh, Satan and man
Said there ain't no use in crying
Cause it will only, only drive you mad
Does it hurt to hear them lying?
Was this the only world you had? Oh, oh

So let me take you, take you to the movie
Can I take you, baby, to the show?
Why don't you let me be yours ever truly
Can I make your garden grow?

You know, that's right



If you start me up
If you start me up, I'll never stop
If you start me up
If you start me up, I'll never stop

I've been running hot
You got me ticking, going to blow my top
If you start me up
If you start me up, I'll never stop
Never stop, never stop, never stop

You make a grown man cry
You make a grown man cry
You make a grown man cry
Spread out the oil, the gasoline
I walk smooth, ride in a mean, mean machine
Start it up

If you start it up
Kick on the starter, give it all you got
You got to, you got to
I can't compete with the riders in the other heats
If you rough it up
If you like it, I can slide it up
Slide it up, slide it up, slide it up
Don't make a grown man cry
Don't make a grown man cry
Don't make a grown man cry
My eyes dilate, my lips go green
My hands are greasy, she's a mean, mean machine
Start it up

Start me up
Ah, ah, give it all you've got
You've got to never, never, never stop
Start it up, whoo!
Ah don't trip me up, just start it up
Start it up, start it up, start it up
Never, never, never

You make a grown man cry
You make a grown man cry
You make a grown man cry
Ride like the wind at double speed
I'll take you places that you've never, never seen
Hey, hey

If you start it up
Love the day and we will never stop, never stop
Never, never, never stop
Start me up
Never stop, never stop
You, you, you make a grown man cry
You, you make a dead man cum
You, you make a dead man cum



Have you seen her?
So fine and pretty
Fooled me with her style and ease
And I feel her from across the room
Yes, it's love in the third degree
Ooh, baby, baby
Won'tcha turn your head my way?
Ooh, baby, baby
Come on, take a chance, you're old enough to
Dance the night away
Oh, come on, baby, dance the night away

A live wire
Barely a beginner, but just watch that lady go
She's on fire
'Cause dancing gets her higher than anything else she knows

Ooh, baby, baby
Won'tcha turn your head my way?
Ooh, baby, baby
Well, don't skip romance, 'cause you're old enough to
Dance the night away
Oh, come on, baby, dance the night away
Ohh, oh-oh-oh, oh yeah


Dance the night away
Hey, hey, yeah
Dance, dance, dance the night away
Uh-come on, baby
Dance the night away
Hey, hey, yeah
Dance, dance, dance the night away
Uh-come on, baby, baby
Dance the night away
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah
Dance, dance, dance the night away
Ahh, ahh-ah, ow!



Breathe, breathe in the air
Don't be afraid to care
Leave, but don't leave me
Look around
Choose your own ground
Long you live and high you fly
And smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry
And all you touch and all you see
Is all your life will ever be
Run, rabbit run
Dig that hole, forget the sun
And when at last the work is done
Don't sit down
It's time to dig another one
For long you live and high you fly
But only if you ride the tide
And balanced on the biggest wave
You race towards an early grave



Well, I was born in a small town
And I live in a small town
Probably die in a small town
Oh, those small communities
All my friends are so small town
My parents live in the same small town
My job is so small town
Provides little opportunity
Educated in a small town
Taught to fear Jesus in a small town
Used to daydream in that small town
Another boring romantic, that's me
But I've seen it all in a small town
Had myself a ball in a small town
Married an L.A. doll and brought her to this small town
Now she's small town just like me
No, I cannot forget from where it is that I come from
I cannot forget the people who love me
Yeah, I can be myself here in this small town
And people let me be just what I want to be
Got nothing against a big town
Still hayseed enough to say, "look who's in the big town"
But my bed is in a small town
Oh, and that's good enough for me
Well, I was born in a small town
And I can breathe in a small town
Gonna die in this small town
Oh that's probably where they'll bury me



Well, I just got into town about an hour ago
Took a look around, see which way the wind blow
Where the little girls in their Hollywood bungalows
Are you a lucky little lady in the City of Light?
Or just another lost angel?
City of Night, City of Night
City of Night, City of Night
L.A. woman, L.A. woman
L.A. woman, Sunday afternoon
L.A. woman, Sunday afternoon
L.A. woman, Sunday afternoon
Drive through your suburbs
Into your blues, into your blues, yeah
Into your blues, into your blues!
I see your hair is burning
Hills are filled with fire
If they say I never loved you
You know they are a liar
Driving down your freeways
Midnight alleys roam
Cops in cars, the topless bars
Never saw a woman so alone
So alone, so alone, so alone
Motel money murder-madness
Let's change the mood from glad to sadness
Mr. Mojo Risin', Mr. Mojo Risin'
Mr. Mojo Risin', Mr. Mojo Risin'
Got to keep on risin'
Mr. Mojo Risin', Mr. Mojo Risin'
Mojo Risin', gotta Mojo Risin'
Mr. Mojo Risin', gotta keep on risin'
Risin', risin'
Gone risin', risin'
I'm gone risin', risin'
I gotta risin', risin'
Well, risin', risin'
I gotta, wooo, yeah, risin'
Whoa, oh yeah
Well, I just got into town about an hour ago
Took a look around, see which way the wind blow
Where the little girls in their Hollywood bungalows
Are you a lucky little lady in The City of Lights?
Or just another lost angel?
City of Night, City of Night
City of Night, City of Night, whoa, c'mon
L.A. Woman, L.A. Woman
L.A. Woman, you're my woman
Little L.A. Woman, Little L.A. Woman
L.A. L.A. Woman Woman
L.A. Woman c'mon



We're gonna play you a song, a little bit of rock-n-roll
You gotta let yourself go, the band's gonna take control
We're gettin' down today
We'll pick you up and take you away
Get down tonight

Smokin', smokin'
We're cookin' tonight, just keep on tokin'
Smokin', smokin'
I feel alright, mamma I'm not jokin', yeah

Get your feet to the floor, everybody rock and roll
You've got nothing to lose just the rhythm and blues, that's all, yeah
We're gonna feel okay
We'll get you up and take you away
Get down tonight

Smokin', smokin'
We're cookin' tonight, just keep on tokin'
Smokin', smokin'

We're gettin' down today
We'll pick you up and take you away
Get down tonight
You know we're gettin' down today
We'll pick you up and take you away
Get down tonight
Alright!



Now the seats are all empty
Let the roadies take the stage
Pack it up and tear it down
They're the first to come and last to leave
Working for that minimum wage
They'll set it up in another town
Tonight the people were so fine
They waited there in line
And when they got up on their feet they made the show
And that was sweet ...
But I can hear the sound
Of slamming doors and folding chairs
And that's a sound they'll never know
Now roll them cases out and lift them amps
Haul them trusses down and get'em up them ramps
Cause when it comes to moving me
You guys are the champs
But when that last guitar's been packed away
You know that I still want to play
So just make sure you got it all set to go
Before you come for my piano

But the band's on the bus
And they're waiting to go
We've got to drive all night and do a show in Chicago
Or Detroit, I don't know
We do so many shows in a row
And these towns all look the same
We just pass the time in our hotel rooms
And wander 'round backstage
Till those lights come up and we hear that crowd
And we remember why we came
Now we got country and western on the bus, R&B
We got disco on eight tracks and cassettes in stereo
We got rural scenes and magazines
And we got truckers on CB
And we got Richard Pryor on the video
We got time to think of the ones we love
While the miles roll away
But the only time that seems too short
Is the time that we get to play
People you've got the power over what we do
You can sit there and wait
Or you can pull us through
Come along, sing the song
You know you can't go wrong
Cause when that morning sun comes beating down
You're going to wake up in your town
But we'll be scheduled to appear
A thousand miles away from here
People stay just a little bit longer
We want to play -- just a little bit longer
Now the promoter don't mind
And the union don't mind
If we take a little time
And we leave it all behind and sing
One more song--
Oh, won't you stay just a little bit longer
Please, please, please, say you will
Say you will
Oh won’t you stay
Just a little bit longer
Oh won’t you stay
Just a little bit longer
And the promoter don’t mind
And the roadies don’t mind
If we take a little time
And we leave it all behind and sing
One more song



I saw a werewolf with a Chinese menu in his hand
Walking through the streets of SoHo in the rain
He was looking for the place called Lee Ho Fook's
Gonna get a big dish of beef chow mein

Ah-hoo, werewolves of London
Ah-hoo
Ah-hoo, werewolves of London
Ah-hoo

If you hear him howling around your kitchen door
You better not let him in
Little old lady got mutilated late last night
Werewolves of London again

Ah-hoo, werewolves of London
Ah-hoo
Ah-hoo, werewolves of London
Ah-hoo, hey

He's the hairy-handed gent who ran amok in Kent
Lately, he's been overheard in Mayfair
You better stay away from him
He'll rip your lungs out, Jim
Huh, I'd like to meet his tailor

Ah-hoo, werewolves of London
Ah-hoo
Ah-hoo, werewolves of London
Ah-hoo

Well, I saw Lon Chaney walking with the Queen
Doin' the werewolves of London
I saw Lon Chaney, Jr. walking with the Queen, uh
Doin' the werewolves of London
I saw a werewolf drinking a piña colada at Trader Vic's
And his hair was perfect
Na!

Ah-hoo, werewolves of London
Huh, draw blood
Ah-hoo, werewolves of London



If the sun refused to shine
I would still be loving you
When mountains crumble to the sea
There will still be you and me

Kind woman, I give you my all
Kind woman, nothing more

Little drops of rain whisper of the pain
Tears of loves lost in the days gone by
My love is strong
With you there is no wrong
Together we shall go until we die, my, my, my
An inspiration is what you are to me
Inspiration - look, see


And so today, my world, it smiles
Your hand in mine, we walk the miles
And thanks to you it will be done
For you to me are the only one
Alright, yeah
Happiness, no more be sad
Happiness - I'm glad
If the sun refused to shine
I would still be loving you
When mountains crumble to the sea
There will still be you and me



Love, I get so lost sometimes
Days pass, and this emptiness fills my heart
When I want to run away, I drive off in my car
But whichever way I go, I come back to the place you are

All my instincts, they return
The grand façade, so soon will burn
Without a noise, without my pride
I reach out from the inside

In your eyes, the light, the heat
In your eyes, I am complete
In your eyes, I see the doorway
In your eyes, to a thousand churches
In your eyes, the resolution
In your eyes, of all the fruitless searches
In your eyes
In your eyes, oh, I see the light and the heat
In your eyes, the light, the heat
In your eyes
Oh, I wanna be that complete
In your eyes, the light, the heat
In your eyes
I wanna touch the light, the heat I see in your eyes
Love, I don't like to see so much pain
So much wasted, and this moment keeps slipping away
I get so tired, working so hard for our survival
I look to the time with you to keep me awake and alive

And all my instincts, they return
And the grand façade, so soon will burn
Without a noise, without my pride
I reach out from the inside

In your eyes your eyes, your eyes
In your eyes
In your eyes, the light, the heat
In your eyes, I am complete
In your eyes, I see the doorway
To a thousand churches
In your eyes, the resolution
In your eyes, of all the fruitless searches
Oh, I see the light and the heat
In your eyes
Oh, I wanna be that complete
In your eyes
I want to touch the light, the heat I see in your eyes
In your eyes
In your eyes
In your eyes
Sa bet chi lamp, chi tangaay, sa bet maangi ci biir

Sa bet chi lamp, chi tangaay, sa bet maangi ci biir
Sa bet chi lamp, chi tangaay, sa bet maangi ci biir

After midnight, we're going to let it all hang down
After midnight, we're going to chug-a-lug and shout
We're going to stimulate some action
We're going to get some satisfaction
We're going to find out what it is all about
After midnight, we're going to let it all hang down

After midnight, we're going to shake your tambourine
After midnight, it's all going to be peaches and cream
We're going to cause talk and suspicion
We're going to give an exhibition
We're going to find out what it is all about
After midnight, we're going to let it all hang down

After midnight, we're going to let it all hang down
After midnight, we're going to shake your tambourine
After midnight, it's all going to be peaches and cream
We're going to because talk and suspicion
We're going to give an exhibition
We're going to find out what it is all about
After midnight, we're going to let it all hang down

After midnight, we're going to let it all hang down
After midnight, we're going to let it all hang down
After midnight, we're going to let it all hang down
After midnight, we're going to let it all hang down
After midnight



Leavin' home, out on the road
I've been down before
Ridin' along on this big ol' jet plane
I've been thinkin' about my home
But my love light teems so far away
And I feel like it's all been done
Somebody's tryin' to make me stay
You know I've got to be movin' on

Oh, oh, big ol' jet airliner
Don't carry me too far away
Oh, oh, big ol' jet airliner
'Cause it's here that I've got to stay

Goodbye to all my friends at home
Goodbye to people I've trusted
I've got to go out and make my way
I might get rich, you know, I might get busted
But my heart keeps calling me backwards
As I get on the 707
Ridin' high, I got tears in my eyes
You know you got to go through hell
Before you get to heaven
Big ol' jet airliner
Don't carry me too far away
Oh, oh, big ol' jet airliner
'Cause it's here that I've got to stay

Touchin' down in New England town
Feel the heat comin' down
I've got to keep on keepin' on
You know the big wheel keeps on spinnin' around
And I'm goin' with some hesitation
You know that I can surely see
That I don't want to get caught up in any of that
Funky shit goin' down in the city

Big ol' jet airliner
Don't carry me too far away
Oh, oh, big ol' jet airliner
'Cause it's here that I've got to stay

Oh, oh, big ol' jet airliner
Don't carry me too far away
Oh, oh, big ol' jet airliner
'Cause it's here that I've got to stay
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Big ol' jet airliner
Don't carry me too far away
Oh, oh, big ol' jet airliner
'Cause it's here that I've got to stay

Oh, oh, big ol' jet airliner
Carry me to my home
Oh, oh, big ol' jet airliner
'Cause it's there that I belong
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Big ol' jet airliner



Seems I've got to have a change of scene
Every night I have the strangest dream
Imprisoned by the way I could have been
Left here on my own or so it seems
I've got to leave before I start to scream
But someone locked the door and took the key
Feeling alright
I'm not feeling too good myself, no
Yes, sir
Feeling alright
I'm not feeling that good myself, no
Boy, you sure took me for one big ride
And even now I sit and I wonder why
That when I think of you
I stop myself from crying
I just can't waste my time
I must get down
Got to stop believing in all your lies
'Cause there's too much to do before I die, hey
Feeling alright
I'm not feeling too good myself, yeah
Oh no
Feeling alright
I'm not feeling too good, little girl
Mmhmm
Don't you get too lost in all I say
Yeah, but at the time you know I really felt that way
But that was then and now you know it's today
I can't get safe so I guess I'm here to stay
Till someone comes along and takes my place
With a different name and a different face
Feeling alright
I'm not feeling that good myself, yeah
Feeling alright
Hey, I'm not feeling that good myself
Oh, you feeling alright
I'm not feeling that good myself
Feeling alright
I'm not feeling good myself
Feeling alright
I'm not feeling too good myself
Feeling alright
I'm not feeling that good myself



Day is night in New York City
Smoke, like water, runs inside
Steel idle trees to pity
Every living thing that's died

Going to hitch a ride
Head for the other side
Leave it all behind
Never change my mind
Going to sail away
Sun lights another day
Freedom on my mind
Carry me away for the last time
Oh yeah

Life is like the coldest winter
People freeze the tears I cry
Words of hail their minds are into
I've got to crack this ice and fly



I can see you in the morning when you go to school
Don't forget your books, you know you've gotta learn the golden rule
Teacher tells you stop your playing and get on with your work
And be like Johnnie-Too-Good, don't you know he never shirks
He's coming along

After school is over, you're playing in the park
But don't be out too late, don't let it get too dark
They tell you not to hang around and learn what life's about
And grow up just like them, won't let you work it out
And you're full of doubt


Don't do this and don't do that
What are they trying to do? (Make a good boy of you)
And do they know where it's at?
But don't criticize, they're old and wise
Do as they tell you to, don't want the devil to
Come and put out your eyes
Maybe I'm mistaken expecting you to fight
Or maybe I'm just crazy, I don't know wrong from right
But while I am still living, I've just got this to say
It's always up to you if you wanna be that
Wanna see that, wanna see it that way
You're coming along



Don't ya love her madly?
Don't ya need her badly?
Don't ya love her ways?
Tell me what you say

Don't you love her madly?
Wanna be her daddy?
Don't ya love her face?
Don't ya love her as she's walkin' out the door
Like she did one thousand times before?

Don't you love her ways?
Tell me what you say
Don't ya love her as she's walking out the door?

All your love
All your love
All your love
All your love

All your love is gone
So sing a lonely song
Of a deep blue dream
Seven horses seem to be on the mark

Yeah, don't you love her?
Don't you love her as she's walking out the door?

All your love
All your love
All your love

Yeah, all your love is gone
So sing a lonely song
Of a deep blue dream
Seven horses seem to be on the mark


Don't you love her madly?
Well, don't ya love her madly?
Don't you love her madly?



I don't care if you hurt me some more
I don't care if you even the score

It's not in the way that you hold me
It's not in the way you say you care
It's not in the way you've been treating my friends
It's not in the way that you stayed till the end
It's not in the way you look or the things that you say that you'll do

Hold the line
Love isn't always on time
Hold the line
Love isn't always on time

It's not in the words that you told me
It's not in the way you say you're mine
It's not in the way that you came back to me
It's not in the way that your love set me free
It's not in the way you look or the things that you say that you'll do

Hold the line
Love isn't always on time
Hold the line
Love isn't always on time

It's not in the words that you told me
It's not in the way you say you're mine
It's not in the way that you came back to me

Airport scurry flurry faces
Parade of passers by
People going many places
With a smile or just a sigh
Waiting waiting pass the time
Another cigarette
Get in line - gate thirty-nine
The time is not here yet (end)

Why try? I know why
This feeling inside me says it's time I was gone
Clear head, new life ahead
It's time I was king now not just one more pawn

Fly by night, away from here
Change my life again
Fly by night, goodbye, my dear
My ship isn't coming and I just can't pretend

Moon rise, thoughtful eyes
Staring back at me from the window beside
No fright or hindsight
Leaving behind that empty feeling inside
Fly by night, away from here
Change my life again
Fly by night, goodbye, my dear
My ship isn't coming and I just can't pretend, whoa!
Woah!


Fly by night, away from here
Change my life again
Fly by night, goodbye, my dear
My ship isn't coming and I just can't pretend

Start a new chapter, find what I'm after
It's changing every day
The change of a season's enough of a reason
To want to get away
Quiet and pensive, my thoughts apprehensive
The hours drift away
Leaving my homeland, playing a lone hand
My life begins today

Fly by night, away from here
Change my life again
Fly by night, goodbye, my dear
My ship isn't coming and I just can't pretend
My ship isn't coming and I just can't pretend
Fly by night, away from here
Change my life again
Fly by night, goodbye, my dear
My ship isn't coming and I just can't pretend
My ship isn't coming and I just can't pretend
My ship isn't coming and I just can't pretend

I seen a girl on a one-way corridor
Stealing down a wrong-way street
For all the world like an urban toreador
She had wheels on, on her feet
Well, the cars do the usual dances
Same old cruise and the kerbside crawl
But the rollergirl, she's taking chances
They just love to see her take them all

No fears alone at night, she's sailing through the crowd
In her ears, the phones are tight, and the music's playing loud

Hallelujah, here she comes
Queen rollerball
Enchanté, what can I say?
Don't care at all
You know, she used to have to wait around
She used to be the lonely one
But now that she can skate around town
She's the only one

No fears alone at night, she's sailing through the crowd
In her ears, the phones are tight, and the music's playing loud
She gets rock and roll and a rock and roll station
And a rock and roll dream
She's making movies on location
She don't know what it means
And the music make her want to be the story
And the story was whatever was the song, what it was
Rollergirl, don't worry
D.J. play the movies all night long, all night long

She tortures taxi drivers just for fun
She like to read their lips
Says, "Toro, toro, taxi, see you tomorrow, my son"
I swear she let a big truck grease her hip
She got her own world in the city
You can't intrude on her, no, no, no
She got her own world in the city
Because the city's been so rude to her

No fears alone at night, she's sailing through the crowd
In her ears, the phones are tight, and the music's playing loud

She gets rock and roll and a rock and roll station
And a rock and roll dream
She's making movies on location
She don't know what it means
But the music make her want to be the story
And the story was whatever was the song, what it was
Rollergirl, don't worry
D.J. play the movies all night long, all night long
Come slipping and sliding
Yeah, life's a roller ball
Slipping and a-sliding
Skateaway, that's all
Skateaway
Shala, shalay, hey hey, skateaway
Now shala, shalay, hey hey, skateaway
She's singing, "Shala, shalay, hey hey"
Skateaway
Shala, shalay



It's been a hard day's night
And I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night
I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright

You know I work all day
To get you money to buy you things
And it's worth it just to hear you say
You're gonna give me everything
So why on earth should I moan
'Cause when I get you alone
You know I feel okay

When I'm home, everything seems to be right
When I'm home feeling you holding me tight
Tight, yeah!

It's been a hard day's night
And I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night
I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright
Ah!

So why on earth should I moan
'Cause when I get you alone
You know I feel okay

When I'm home everything seems to be right
When I'm home feeling  you holding me tight
Tight, yeah!

It's been a hard day's night
And I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night
I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright

You know I feel alright
You know I feel alright



Finished with my woman 'cause she couldn't help me with my mind
People think I'm insane because I am frowning all the time
All day long, I think of things but nothing seems to satisfy
Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something to pacify

Can you help me occupy my brain?
Whoa, yeah

I need someone to show me the things in life that I can't find
I can't see the things that make true happiness, I must be blind


Make a joke and I will sigh and you will laugh and I will cry
Happiness, I cannot feel and love to me is so unreal
And so, as you hear these words telling you now of my state
I tell you to enjoy life, I wish I could, but it's too late



Guess who just got back today?
Them wild-eyed boys that'd been away
Haven't changed, hadn't much to say
But man, I still think them cats are crazy
They were askin' if you were around
How you was, where you could be found
Told them you were livin' downtown
Drivin' all the old men crazy

The boys are back in town
The boys are back in town
I said, the boys are back in town
The boys are back in town
The boys are back in town
The boys are back in town
The boys are back in town
The boys are back in town

You know that chick that used to dance a lot?
Every night, she'd be on the floor, shakin' what she's got
Man, when I tell ya she was cool, she was red hot
I mean she was steamin'
And that time over at Johnny's place
Well, this chick got up and she slapped Johnny's face
Man, we just fell about the place
If that chick don't wanna know, forget her
The boys are back in town
The boys are back in town
I said, the boys are back in town
The boys are back in town
The boys are back in town
The boys are back in town
The boys are back in town
The boys are back in town
{Instrumental}

Spread the word around...
Guess who's back in town!
You spread the word around!

Friday night they'll be dressed to kill
Down at Dino's bar and grill
The drink will flow, and blood will spill
And if the boys wanna fight, you better let 'em
That jukebox in the corner blasting out my favourite song
The nights are gettin' warmer, it won't be long
Won't be long 'til summer comes
Now that the boys are here again
The boys are back in town
The boys are back in town
The boys are back in town
The boys are back in town
The boys are back in town
The boys are back in town
(Spread the word around)
The boys are back in town
The boys are back in town
(The boys are back, the boys are back)


The boys are back in town again
They're hangin' down at Dino's
The boys are back in town again!

(Ah) I am just a new boy
A stranger in this town
Where are all the good times?
Who's gonna show this stranger around?

Ooh, I need a dirty woman
Ooh, I need a dirty girl

Will some woman in this desert land
Make me feel like a real man?
Take this rock-and-roll refugee
Ooh, baby, set me free

Ooh, I need a dirty woman
Ooh, I need a dirty girl

Ooh, I need a dirty woman
Ooh, I need a dirty girl
*Phone beeping*
"Hello?"
"Yes, a collect call for Mrs. Floyd from Mr. Floyd. Will you accept the charge from the United States?"
*Phone clicks*
"Oh, he hung up. That's your residence, right? Well, I wonder why he hung up. Is there supposed to be someone out there besides your wife there to answer?"
*Phone redials and beeps again*
"Hello?"
"This is the United States calling. Are we reaching..."
*Phone clicks*
"See, he keeps hanging up, and it's a man answering."



On the day I was born, the nurses all gathered 'round
And they gazed in wide wonder at the joy they had found
The head nurse spoke up, said "Leave this one alone."
She could tell right away that I was bad to the bone

Bad to the bone
Bad to the bone
B-B-B-B-Bad
B-B-B-B-Bad
B-B-B-B-Bad
Bad to the bone

I'll break a thousand more baby before I am through
I wanna be yours pretty baby, yours and yours alone
I'm here to tell ya honey that I'm bad to the bone

Bad to the bone
B-B-B-Bad
B-B-B-Bad

I make a rich woman beg, I'll make a good woman steal
I'll make an old woman blush and make a young girl squeal
I wanna be yours pretty baby, yours and yours alone
I'm here to tell ya honey, that I'm bad to the bone

B-B-B-B-Bad
B-B-B-B-Bad

Every woman I meet, they all stay satisfied

And I'm here to tell ya honey that I'm bad to the bone

B-B-B-B-Bad
B-B-B-B-Bad

Why do we never get an answer
When we're knocking at the door?
With a thousand million questions
About hate and death and war
'Cause when we stop and look around us
There is nothing that we need
In a world of persecution
That is burning in its greed
(ahhhh ahh ah)
(ahhhh ahh ah)
Ahhhh ahh ah
Why do we never get an answer
When we're knocking at the door?
Because the truth is hard to swallow
That's what the wall of love is for
It's not the way that you say it
When you do those things to me
It's more the way that you mean it
When you tell me what will be
And when you stop and think about it
You won't believe it's true
That all the love you've been giving
Has all been meant for you
I'm looking for someone to change my life
I'm looking for a miracle in my life
And if you could see what it's done to me
To lose the love I knew
Could safely lead me through
Between the silence of the mountains
And the crashing of the sea
There lies a land I once lived in
And she's waiting there for me
But in the grey of the morning
My mind becomes confused
Between the dead and the sleeping
And the road that I must choose
I'm looking for someone to change my life
I'm looking for a miracle in my life
And if you could see what it's done to me
To lose the love I knew
Could safely lead me to
The land that I once knew
To learn as we grow old
The secrets of our souls
It's not the way that you say it
When you do those things to me
It's more the way you really mean it
When you tell me what will be
Why do we never get an answer
When we're knocking at the door?
With a thousand million questions
About hate and death and war
When we stop and look around us
There is nothing that we need
In a world of persecution
That is burning in it's greed
(ahhhh ahh ah)
(ahhhh ahh ah)
Ahhhh ahh ah
Why do we never get an answer
When we're knocking at the door?



I went down to the crossroads, fell down on my knees
Down to the crossroads fell down on my knees
Asked the Lord above for mercy, "Take me, if you please"

I went down to the crossroads tried to flag a ride
Down to the crossroads tried to flag a ride
Nobody seemed to know me, everybody passed me by

Well, I'm going down to Rosedale, take my rider by my side
Going down to Rosedale, take my rider by my side
We can still barrelhouse, baby, on the riverside


Going down to Rosedale, take my rider by my side
Going down to Rosedale, take my rider by my side
We can still barrel house, baby, on the riverside


You can run, you can run tell my friend boy Willie Brown
Run, you can run tell my friend boy Willie Brown
And I'm standing at the crossroads believe I'm sinking down
(Spoken) Uh, Eric Clapton lead, uh vocal



I met a gin-soaked barroom queen in Memphis
She tried to take me upstairs for a ride
She had to heave me right across her shoulder
Cause I just can't seem to drink it off my mind

It's the honky tonk women
Gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues

I laid a divorcee in New York City
I had to put up some kind of a fight
The lady then she covered me with roses
She blew my nose and then she blew my mind

It's the honky tonk women
Gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues

Strollin' on the boulevards of Paris
Naked as the day that I will die
The sailors, they're so charming there in Paris
But I just don't seem to sail you off my mind
It's the honky tonk women
Gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues



Everybody, listen to me
And return me my ship
I'm your captain, I'm your captain
Though I'm feeling mighty sick
I've been lost now, days uncounted
And it's months since I've seen home
Can you hear me, can you hear me
Or am I all alone
If you return me to my home port
I will kiss you, Mother Earth
Take me back now, take me back now
To the port of my birth
Am I in my cabin dreaming
Or are you really scheming
To take my ship away from me?
You'd better think about it
I just can't live without it
So, please don't take my ship from me, yeah, yeah, yeah
I can feel the hand of a stranger
And it's tightening around my throat
Heaven help me, Heaven help me
Take this stranger from my boat
I'm your captain, I'm your captain
Though I'm feeling mighty sick
Everybody, listen to me
And return me my ship
I'm your captain, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm your captain, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm your captain, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm your captain, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm getting closer to my home
I'm getting closer to my home
I'm getting closer to my home
I'm getting closer to my home, oh
I'm getting closer to my home
I'm getting closer to my home
I'm getting closer to my home
I'm getting closer to my home



Eight miles high, and when you touch down
You'll find that it's stranger than known
Signs in the street, that say where you're going
Are somewhere just being their own
Nowhere is there warmth to be found
Among those afraid of losing their ground
Rain gray town, known for its sound
In places, small faces unbound
Round the squares, huddled in storms
Some laughing, some just shapeless forms
Sidewalk scenes, and black limousines
Some living, some standing alone



Girl, it's been a long time that we've been apart
Much too long for a man who needs love
I miss you since I've been away
Babe, it wasn't easy to leave you alone
It's getting harder each time that I go
If I had the choice, I would stay
 x2
There's no one like you
I can't wait for the nights with you
I imagine the things we'll do
I just want to be loved by you
No one like you

Girl, there are really no words strong enough
To describe all my longing for love
I don't want my feelings restrained
Oh, babe, I just need you like never before
Just imagine you'd come through this door
You'd take all my sorrow away
 x2
There's no one like you
I can't wait for the nights with you
I imagine the things we'll do
I just want to be loved by you
No one like you

 x2
There's no one like you
I can't wait for the nights with you
I imagine the things we'll do
I just want to be loved by you
No one like you



Nobody on the road
Nobody on the beach
I feel it in the air
The summer's out of reach
Empty lake, empty streets
The sun goes down alone
I'm driving by your house
Though I know you're not home

But I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the sun
You got your hair combed back and your
Sunglasses on, baby
I can tell you, my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

I never will forget those nights
I wonder if it was a dream
Remember how you made me crazy?
Remember how I made you scream?
Now I don't understand what happened to our love
But babe, I'm gonna get you back
I'm going to show you what I'm made of
I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the sun
I see you walking real slow and
Smiling at everyone
I can tell you, my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

Out on the road today
I saw a Deadhead sticker on a Cadillac
A little voice inside my head said
“Don't look back, you can never look back”
I thought I knew what love was, what did I know?
Those days are gone forever
I should just let them go but...

I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the sun
You got the top pulled down and the
Radio on, baby
I can tell you, my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone
I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the sun
You got your hair slicked back and those
Wayfarers on, baby
I can tell you, my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone



I turn my back to the wind
To catch my breath before I start off again
Driven on without a moment to spend
To pass an evening with a drink and a friend
I let my skin get too thin
I'd like to pause, no matter what I pretend
Like some pilgrim who learns to transcend
Learns to live as if each step was the end

(Time stand still)
I'm not looking back, but I want to look around me now
(Time stand still)
See more of the people and the places that surround me now
Time stand still
Freeze this moment a little bit longer
Make each sensation a little bit stronger
Experience slips away
Experience slips away
Time stand still

I turn my face to the sun
Close my eyes, let my defenses down
All those wounds that I can't get unwound
I let my past go too fast
No time to pause
If I could slow it all down
Like some captain, whose ship runs aground
I can wait until the tide comes around

(Time stand still)
I'm not looking back, but I want to look around me now
(Time stand still)
See more of the people and the places that surround me now
Freeze this moment a little bit longer
Make each sensation a little bit stronger
Make each impression a little bit stronger
Freeze this motion a little bit longer
The innocence slips away
The innocence slips away
Time stand still
Time stand still

I'm not looking back, but I want to look around me now
See more of the people and the places that surround me now
Time stand still
Summer's going fast, nights growing colder
Children growing up, old friends growing older
Freeze this moment a little bit longer
Make each sensation a little bit stronger

Experience slips away
Experience slips away
The innocence slips away



Well, I came upon a child of God
He was walking along the road
And I asked him, "tell me, where are you going?"
This he told me
Said, "I'm going down to Yasgur's Farm
Gonna join in a rock and roll band
Got to get back to the land
And set my soul free"
We are stardust, we are golden
We are billion-year-old carbon
And we've got to get ourselves
Back to the garden
Well, then can I walk beside you?
I have come to lose the smog
And I feel myself a cog
In somethin' turning
And maybe it's the time of year
Yes, and maybe it's the time of man
And I don't know who I am
But life is for learning
We are stardust, we are golden
We are billion-year-old carbon
And we got to get ourselves
Back to the garden
We are stardust, we are golden
We are billion-year-old carbon
And we got to get ourselves
Back to the garden
By the time we got to Woodstock
We were half a million strong
And everywhere was a song
And a celebration
And I dreamed I saw the bomber jet planes
Riding shotgun in the sky
Turning into butterflies
Above our nation
We are stardust, we are golden
We are caught in the devil's bargain
And we got to get ourselves
Back to the garden



Must be getting early
Clocks are running late
Paint by number morning sky looks so phony
Dawn is breaking everywhere
Light a candle, curse the glare
Draw the curtains, I don't care 'cause it's alright

I will get by
I will get by
I will get by
I will survive

I see you've got your fists out, say your piece and get out
Guess I get the gist of it but it's alright
Sorry that you feel that way
The only thing there is to say
Every silver lining's got a touch of grey

I will get by
I will get by
I will get by
I will survive
It's a lesson to me
The Deltas and the East and the Freeze
The ABCs we all think of
To try to win a little love

I know the rent is in arrears, the dog has not been fed in years
It's even worse than it appears but it's alright
Cow is given kerosene
Kid can't read at seventeen
The words he knows are all obscene but it's alright

I will get by
I will get by
I will get by
I will survive

The shoe is on the hand it fits
There's really nothing much to it
Whistle through your teeth and spit because it's alright
Oh, well, a touch of grey, kind of suits you anyway
That's was all I had to say but it's alright
I will get by
I will get by
I will get by
I will survive

We will get by
We will get by
We will get by
We will survive

When the sun comes up on a sleepy little town
Down around San Antone
And the folks are risin' for another day
Roundabout their homes
The people of the town are strange
And they're proud of where they came
Well, you're talkin bout China Grove (China)
Oh-oh-oh, China Grove, oh-oh-oh
Well, the preacher and the teacher
Lord, they're a caution
They are the talk of the town
When the gossip gets to flyin'
And they ain't lyin'
When the sun goes fallin' down
They say that the father's insane
And dear Mrs. Perkins a game
We're talkin' 'bout the China Grove (China)
Oh-oh-oh, China Grove, oh-oh-oh
But every day there's a new thing comin'
The ways of an Oriental view
The sheriff and his buddies
With their samurai swords
You can even hear the music at night
And though it's a part of the Lone Star State
People don't seem to care
They just keep on lookin to the East
Talkin bout the China Grove (China)
Oh-oh-oh, China Grove, oh-oh-oh



This is the day
Of the expanding man
That shape is my shade
There where I used to stand
It seems like only yesterday
I gazed through the glass
At ramblers, wild gamblers
That's all in the past
You call me a fool
You say it's a crazy scheme
This one's for real
I already bought the dream
So useless to ask me why
Throw a kiss and say goodbye
I'll make it this time
I'm ready to cross that fine line
Learn to work the saxophone
I, I'll play just what I feel
Drink Scotch whisky all night long
And die behind the wheel
They got a name for the winners in the world
I, I want a name when I lose
They call Alabama the Crimson Tide
Call me Deacon Blues (Deacon Blues)
My back to the wall
A victim of laughing chance
This is for me
The essence of true romance
Sharing the things we know and love
With those of my kind
Libations, sensations
That stagger the mind
I crawl like a viper
Through these suburban streets
Make love to these women
Languid and bittersweet
I'll rise when the sun goes down
Cover every game in town
A world of my own
I'll make it my home sweet home

Learn to work the saxophone
I, I'll play just what I feel
Drink Scotch whisky all night long
And die behind the wheel
They got a name for the winners in the world
I, I want a name when I lose
They call Alabama the Crimson Tide
Call me Deacon Blues (Deacon Blues)

This is the night
Of the expanding man
I take one last drag
As I approach the stand
I cried when I wrote this song
Sue me if I play too long
This brother is free
I'll be what I want to be

I'll learn to work the saxophone
I, I'll play just what I feel
Drink Scotch whisky all night long
And die behind the wheel
They got a name for the winners in the world
I, I want a name when I lose
They call Alabama the Crimson Tide
Call me Deacon Blues (Deacon Blues)



Yow....yow....yow
Huh, huh, huh

Please allow me to introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
I've been around for a long, long year
Stole many a man's soul and faith
I was 'round when Jesus Christ
Had his moment of doubt and pain
Made damn sure that Pilate
Washed his hands and sealed his fate

Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game

I stuck around St. Petersburg
When I saw it was a time for a change
Killed the Czar and his ministers
Anastasia screamed in vain
I rode a tank, held a general's rank
When the Blitzkrieg raged and the bodies stank
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name, oh yeah
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game, ah yeah

I watched with glee while your kings and queens
Fought for ten decades for the gods they made
I shouted out, "Who killed the Kennedys?"
Well, after all, it was you and me
Let me please introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
And I laid traps for troubadours
Who get killed before they reach Bombay

Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name, oh yeah
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game, ah yeah
Oh yeah, get down heavy!


Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name, oh yeah
But what's confusin' you is just the nature of my game, mm yeah
Just as every cop is a criminal
And all the sinners saints
As heads is tails, just call me Lucifer
'Cause I'm in need of some restraint
So if you meet me, have some courtesy
Have some sympathy, and some taste
Use all your well-learned politesse
Or I'll lay your soul to waste, mm yeah

Pleased to meet you, hope you guessed my name, mm yeah
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game, mmm mean it
Get down
Woo hoo!
Ah yeah, get on down
Oh yeah
Ba bum bum, ba ba bum....
Ah yeah
Tell me, baby, what's my name?
Tell me, honey, can you guess my name?
Tell me, baby, what's my name?
I'll tell you one time, you're to blame
Ooo hoo, ooo hoo, oooo hoo
All right
Ooo hoo hoo, ooo hoo hoo, ooo hoo hoo
Ah yeah
Ooo hoo hoo, ooo hoo hoo
Ah yes, what's my name?
Tell me, baby, ah what's my name?
Tell me, sweetie, what's my name?
Ooo hoo hoo, ooo hoo hoo, ooo hoo hoo, ooo hoo hoo
Ooo hoo hoo, ooo hoo hoo, ooo hoo hoo
Ah yeah
What's my name...



I come in last night about half past ten
That baby of mine wouldn't let me in
So move it on over. Rock it on over
Move over little dog, a mean, old dog is movin' in
She told me not to mess around
But I done let the deal go down
Move it on over. Rock it on over
Move over nice dog, a big, fat dog is movin' in
She changed the lock on my back door
Now my key won't fit no more
Move it on over. Rock it on over
Move over nice dog, a mean, old dog is movin' in
She threw me out just as pretty as she pleased
Pretty soon I've been scratchin' fleas
Move it on over. Slide it on over
Move over nice dog, a mean, old dog is movin' in
Yeah! Listen to me dog before you start to whine
That side's yours and this side's mine
Move it on over. Rock it on over
Move over little dog, a big, old dog is movin' in
Yeah! She changed the lock on my back door
Now my key won't fit no more
Move it on over. Rock it on over
Move over little dog, a big, old dog is movin' in
Move it on over. Move it on over
Move it on over. Won't'cha rock it on over
Move over cool dog, a hot dog's movin' in



When the truth is found to be lies
And all the joy within you dies

Don't you want somebody to love?
Don't you need somebody to love?
Wouldn't you love somebody to love?
You better find somebody to love
Love, love

When the garden flowers
Baby, are dead, yes and
Your mind, your mind is so full of red

Don't you want somebody to love?
Don't you need somebody to love?
Wouldn't you love somebody to love?
You better find somebody to love

Your eyes, I say your eyes may look like his
Yeah but in your head, baby
I'm afraid you don't know where it is
Don't you want somebody to love?
Don't you need somebody to love?
Wouldn't you love somebody to love?
You better find somebody to love

Tears are running
They're all running down your breast
And your friends, baby
They treat you like a guest

Don't you want somebody to love?
Don't you need somebody to love?
Wouldn't you love somebody to love?
You better find somebody to love



She grew up in an Indiana town
Had a good lookin' mama who never was around
But she grew up tall and she grew up right
With them Indiana boys on them Indiana nights
Well, she moved down here at the age of eighteen
She blew the boys away, was more than they'd seen
I was introduced and we both started groovin'
She said, "I dig you baby, but I got to keep movin' on
Keep movin' on"

Last dance with Mary Jane, one more time to kill the pain
I feel summer creepin' in and I'm tired of this town again

Well, I don't know, but I've been told
You never slow down, you never grow old
I'm tired of screwin' up, tired of going down
Tired of myself, tired of this town

Oh, my, my, oh, hell yes
Honey, put on that party dress
Buy me a drink, sing me a song
Take me as I come 'cause I can't stay long
Last dance with Mary Jane, one more time to kill the pain
I feel summer creepin' in and I'm tired of this town again

There's pigeons down on Market Square
She's standin' in her underwear
Lookin' down from a hotel room
The nightfall will be comin' soon

Oh, my, my, oh, hell yes
You got to put on that party dress
It was too cold to cry when I woke up alone
I hit my last number and walked to the road

Last dance with Mary Jane, one more time to kill the pain
I feel summer creepin' in and I'm tired of this town again



All aboard! Hahahahahahaaaa!
Ay (Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay)

Crazy, but that's how it goes
Millions of people living as foes
Maybe it's not too late
To learn how to love and forget how to hate

Mental wounds not healing
Life's a bitter shame

I'm going off the rails on a crazy train
I'm going off the rails on a crazy train
(Let's go!)

I've listened to preachers, I've listened to fools
I've watched all the dropouts who make their own rules
One person conditioned to rule and control
The media sells it and you live the role

Mental wounds still screaming
Driving me insane
I'm going off the rails on a crazy train
I'm going off the rails on a crazy train

I know that things are going wrong for me
You gotta listen to my words, yeah, yeah!

Heirs of a cold war, that's what we've become
Inheriting troubles, I'm mentally numb
Crazy, I just cannot bear
I'm living with something that just isn't fair

Mental wounds not healing
Who and what's to blame?

I'm going off the rails on a crazy train
I'm going off the rails on a crazy train

(Hahahahahahahaha!)
(Crazy!)
(Gibberish)



Walking in the park just the other day, baby
What do you, what do you think I saw?
Crowds of people sitting on the grass with flowers in their hair said
Hey, boy, do you wanna score?
And you know how it is?
I really don't know what time it was
Woah, oh, oh
So I asked them if I could stay a while

I didn't notice but it had got very dark and I was really
Really out of my mind
Just then a policeman stepped up to me
And asked us said please, hey, would we care
To all get in line, get in line
Well, you know, they asked us to stay for tea and have some fun
Oh, oh, oh
He said that his friends would all drop by, ooh

Why don't you take a good look at yourself
And describe what you see?
And baby, baby, baby, do you like it?
There you sit, sitting spare like a book on a shelf rusting
Ah! Not trying to fight it
You really don't care if they're coming?
Oh, oh, oh
I know that it's all a state of mind, ooh (No, no, no!)

If you go down in the streets
Today, baby you better
You better open your eyes
Folk down there really don't care
Really don't care, don't care, really don't
Which, which way the pressure lies
So I've decided what I'm going to do now
So I'm packing my bags for the Misty Mountains
Where the spirits go now
Over the hills where the spirits fly, ooh

I really don't know, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I really don't know, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I really don't know



Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run
You better make your face up with your favourite disguise
With your button down lips and your roller blind eyes
With your empty smile and your hungry heart
Feel the bile rising from your guilty past
With your nerves in tatters as the cockleshell shatters
And the hammers batter down your door
You better run!
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run

You better run all day and run all night
And keep your dirty feelings deep inside
And if you're taking your girlfriend out tonight
You better park the car well out of sight
'Cause if they catch you in the back seat trying to pick her locks
They're gonna send you back to Mother in a cardboard box
You better run!



Day by day, night after night
Blinded by the neon lights
Hurry here, hustlin' there
No one's got the time to spare
Money's tight, nothin' free
Won't somebody come and rescue me?

I am stranded, caught in the crossfire
Stranded, caught in the crossfire

Tooth for tooth, eye for an eye
Sell your soul just to buy, buy, buy
Beggin' a dollar, stealin' a dime
Come on can't you see that I

I am stranded, caught in the crossfire
I am stranded, caught in the crossfire

I need some kind of kindness, some kind of sympathy oh, no
We're stranded, caught in the crossfire
Save the strong lose the weak
Never turning the other cheek
Trust nobody don't be no fool
Whatever happened to the golden rule?

We got stranded, caught in the crossfire
We got stranded, caught in the crossfire
We got stranded, caught in the crossfire
Stranded, caught in the crossfire
Help me



Lovely Rita, meter maid
Lovely Rita, meter maid

Lovely Rita, meter maid
Nothing can come between us
When it gets dark I tow your heart away

Standing by a parking meter
When I caught a glimpse of Rita
Filling in a ticket in her little white book
In a cap she looked much older
And the bag across her shoulder
Made her look a little like a military man

Lovely Rita, meter maid
May I inquire discreetly (Lovely Rita)
When are you free to take some tea with me? (Lovely Rita maid! Ahh-ah-ah)
Rita!


Took her out and tried to win her
Had a laugh and over dinner
Told her I would really like to see her again
Got the bill and Rita paid it
Took her home, I nearly made it
Sitting on the sofa with a sister or two
Oh, lovely Rita meter maid
Where would I be without you?
Give us a wink and make me think of you

Lovely Rita meter maid (Lovely meter maid)
Lovely Rita meter maid (Rita meter maid)
Lovely Rita meter maid (Oh Lovely Rita, meter meter maid)
Lovely Rita meter maid
Ah da, ah da, ah da, ah da
Ah da, ah da, ah da, ah da
Ah da, ah da, ah da, ah da
Ah da, ah da, ah da, ah da



There's a black man with a black cat
Livin' in a black neighborhood
He's got an Interstate runnin' through his front yard
You know he thinks that he's got it so good

And there's a woman in the kitchen
Cleanin' up the evenin' slop
And he looks at her and says, "Hey darlin'
I can remember when you could stop a clock."

Oh, but ain't that America for you and me?
Ain't that America somethin' to see, baby?
Ain't that America home of the free, yeah?
Little pink houses for you and me
Oh, yeah, for you and me
Ey!

Well, there's a young man in a t-shirt
Listen' to a rock 'n' roll station
He's got greasy hair, greasy smile
He says, "Lord, this must be my destination"
Cause they told me when I was younger
Sayin', "boy, you're gonna be president"
But just like everything else, those old crazy dreams
Just kinda came and went

Oh, but ain't that America for you and me?
Ain't that America somethin' to see baby?
Ain't that America home of the free, yeah?
Little pink houses for you and me
Oh, baby, for you and me

Well, there's people and more people
What do they know, know, know
Go to work in some high rise
And vacation down at the Gulf of Mexico
Ooh, yeah

And there's winners, and there's losers
But they ain't no big deal
Cause the simple man baby pays the thrills
The bills, the pills that kill
Oh, but ain't that America for you and me?
Ain't that America somethin' to see, baby?
Ain't that America, home of the free, yeah?
Little pink houses for you and me
Ooh
Ooh yeah

Ain't that America
For you and me?
Ain't that America
Hey, well somethin' to see baby?
Ain't that America
Oh, well the home of the free
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Little pink houses, baby, for you and me

Ooh yeah
Ooh yeah



I was cutting the rug down at a place called The Jug
With a girl named Linda Lou
When in walked a man with a gun in his hand
And he was looking for you-know-who
He said, "Hey there fellow with the hair colored yellow
What you trying to prove?
'Cause that's my woman there and I'm a man who cares
And this might be all for you"
I said, "Excuse me"

I was scared and fearing for my life
I was shaking like a leaf on a tree
'Cause he was lean, and mean, and
Big and bad, Lord, a-pointing that gun at me
"Oh wait a minute, mister, I didn't even kiss her
Don't want no trouble with you
And I know you don't owe me but I wish you would let me
Ask one favor from you"

"Oh won't you give me three steps, gimme three steps, mister
Gimme three steps towards the door?
Gimme three steps, gimme three steps, mister
And you'll never see-a me no more
For sure"

Well the crowd cleared away and I began to pray
And the water fell on the floor
And I'm telling you, son, well, it ain't no fun
Staring straight down a forty-four
Well he turned and there screamed at Linda Lou
And that's the break I was looking for
And you could hear me screaming a mile away
As I was headed out towards the door

"Oh won't you give me three steps, gimme three steps, mister
Gimme three steps towards the door?
Gimme three steps, gimme three steps, mister
And you'll never see-a me no more
Show me the back door"



Hey Joe, where you going with that gun in your hand?
Hey Joe, I said, where you going with that gun in your hand?

I'm going down to shoot my old lady
You know, I caught her messing around with another man
I'm going down to shoot my old lady
You know, I caught her messing around with another man
And that ain't too cool

Hey Joe, I heard you shot your woman down
You shot her down, now
Hey Joe, I heard you shot your old lady down
You shot her down to the ground

Yes I did, I shot her
You know, I caught her messing around, messing around town
Yes I did, I shot her
You know, I caught my old lady messing around town
And I gave her the gun, I shot her!
Hey Joe, alright
Shoot her one more time, baby

Hey Joe, where you going to run to now?
Where you going to run to?
Hey Joe, I said, where you going to run to now?
Where you, where you going to go?
Well, dig it

I'm going way down south
Way down to Mexico way, alright
I'm going way down south
Way down where I can be free
There's no one going to find me

Ain't no hangman going to
He ain't gonna put a rope around me
You better believe it right now, I got to go now

Hey Joe, you better run on down
Goodbye everybody, ow!
Hey Joe, run on down



You know the day destroys the night
Night divides the day
Tried to run, tried to hide

Break on through to the other side
Break on through to the other side
Break on through to the other side

We chased our pleasures here
Dug our treasures there
Still recall the times we cried?

Break on through to the other side
Break on through to the other side
Break on through yeah, whoa yeah

Oh! Ooh!

Yeah
Everybody loves my baby
Everybody loves my baby
She get

Get higher baby
Get higher
Get high, get high
Baby get high now
I found an island in your arms
Country in your eyes
Arms that chained us, eyes that lied

Break on through to the other side
Break on through to the other side
Break on through, yeah
Whoa yeah!

Yeah, made the scene, week to week
Day to day, hour to hour
Gate is straight, deep and wide

Break on through to the other side
Break on through to the other side
Break on through, break on through
Break on through, break on through
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah



Lines form on my face and hands
Lines form from the ups and downs
I'm in the middle without any plans
I'm a boy and I'm a man

I'm eighteen, and I don't know what I want
Eighteen, I just don't know what I want
Eighteen, I gotta get away
I gotta get out of this place, I'll go runnin in outer space, oh yeah

I got a baby's brain and an old man's heart
Took eighteen years to get this far
Don't always know what I'm talkin' about
Feels like I'm livin' in the middle of doubt

'Cause I'm eighteen
I get confused everyday
Eighteen, I just don't know what to say
Eighteen, I gotta get away

Lines form on my face and my hands
Lines form on the left and right
I'm in the middle, the middle of life
I'm a boy and I'm a man
I'm eighteen and I like it
Yes I like it, oh I like it, love it, like it, love it
Eighteen, Eighteen!
Eighteen, eighteen and I like it



The sky was dark this morning
When I raised my head
I stood at the window- darkness was my bane
Suddenly a sunbeam arch
Thrilled me to my weary heart
It was the prettiest thing I'd ever seen
I knew I had to keep my love
Keep my love alive
Keep my love- keep my love alive
Baby I want you to roll me
Hold me in your love
No more habits, promises and jive
Ever since I was a baby girl
Wanted one thing most in this world
It was to keep my love- keep my love alive
Yeah, got to keep my love- keep my love alive
Keep my love- keep my love alive

You're up there under the spotlight
Your silver trophy shines
With all you got, my lord! you must get high
You need a whole lot more than money
You need more than to survive
You gotta keep your love
Keep your love alive!
Oo, you got to keep your love, keep your love alive
Keep your love now, keep it alive



 Golden Slumbers, take 1!
 Yeah, there's a couple on the album like that
Day after day...

Once there was a way to get back homeward
Once there was a way to get back home
Sleep pretty darling do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby
Golden slumbers fill your eyes
Smiles awake you when you rise
Sleep pretty darling do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby
Once there was a way to get back homeward
Once there was a way to get back home
Sleep pretty darling do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby
Boy, you're gonna carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time
Boy...
 Three
 Okay

Once there was a way to get back homeward
Once there was a way to get back home
Sleep pretty darling do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby
Golden...
Fill your...
Okay



She likes wearing lipstick
She likes French cuisine
But she won't let me use my passion
Unless it's in a limousine

She got me under pressure
She got me under pressure
She likes the art museum
She don't like Pavlov's dog
She fun at the mind museum
She likes it in a London fog

She don't like other women
She likes whips and chains
She likes cocaine
And flipping out with great Danes
She's about all I can handle
It's too much for my brain

It's got me under pressure
It's got me under pressure

I'm gonna give her a message
Here's what I'm gonna say:
"It's all over"
She might get out a nightstick
And hurt me real, real bad
By the roadside in a ditch

It's got me under pressure
It's got me under pressure
It's got me under pressure
It's got me under pressure



{Funeral for a Friend}

{Love Lies Bleeding}
The roses in the window box have tilted to one side
Everything about this house was born to grow and die
Oh, it doesn't seem a year ago to this very day
You said, "I'm sorry, honey, if I don't change the pace
I can't face another day"

And love lies bleedin' in my hands
Oh, it kills me to think of you with another man
I was playin' rock and roll, and you were just a fan
But my guitar couldn't hold you, so I split the band
Love lies bleedin' in my hands

I wonder if those changes have left a scar on you
Like all the burnin' hoops of fire that you and I passed through
You're a bluebird on a telegraph line, I hope you're happy now
Well, if the wind of change comes down your way, girl
You'll make it back somehow

And love lies bleedin' in my hands
Oh, it kills me to think of you with another man
I was playin' rock and roll, and you were just a fan
But my guitar couldn't hold you, so I split the band
Love lies bleedin' in my hands
And love lies bleedin' in my hands
Oh, it kills me to think of you with another man
I was playin' rock and roll, and you were just a fan
But my guitar couldn't hold you, so I split the band
Love lies bleedin' in my hands

Oh!
Oh!
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Love lies bleedin' in my hands
Ooh-hoo! Ooh-hoo! Ooh-hoo!
Ooh-hoo! Ooh-hoo! Ooh-hoo!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!



Saturday night I was downtown
Working for the FBI
Sittin' in a nest of bad men
Whiskey bottles piling high
Bootlegging boozer on the west side
Full of people who are doing wrong
Just about to call up the DA man
When I heard this woman sing a song
A pair of 45's made me open my eyes
My temperature started to rise
She was a long cool woman in a black dress
Just-a 5'9, beautiful, tall
With just one look I was a bad mess
'Cause that long cool woman had it all

I saw her heading to the table
Like a tall walking big black cat
When Charlie said I hope that you're able, boy
Cause I'm telling you she knows where it's at
Then suddenly we heard the sirens
And everybody started to run
A-jumping out of doors and tables
When I heard somebody shootin' a gun
Well the DA was pumping my left hand
And a-she was a-holding my right
Well I told her don't get scared
'Cause you're gonna be spared
I've gotta be forgiven if I wanna spend my living
With a long cool woman in a black dress
Just a 5'9 beautiful tall
Yeah, with just one look I was a bad mess
Cause that long cool woman had it all
Had it all
Had it all



Ooo oooohhhh
Ooo oooohhhh
Come on and dance, come on and dance
Let's make some romance
You know the night is falling
And the music's calling
And we've got to get down to Swingtown

We've been working so hard
We've been working so hard
Come on, baby
Come on, baby, let's dance

Ooo oooohhhh
Ooo oooohhhh
Come on and dance, come on and dance
We may not get another chance
You know the night is falling
And the music's calling
And we've got to get down to Swingtown



I sleep all day, out all night
I know where you're goin'
I don't think that's a-actin' right
You don't think it's showin'


A-jumpin' up, fallin' down
Don't misunderstand me
You don't think that I know your plan
What you tryin' to hand me?


Out all night, sleep all day
I know what you're doin'
If you're gonna a-act that way
I think there's trouble brewin'



You made a fool of me, but them broken dreams have got to end

Hey woman, you got the blues
'Cause you ain't got no one else to use
There's an open road that leads nowhere
So just make some miles between here and there
There's a hole in my head where the rain comes in
You took my body and played to win
Ha, ha, woman, it's a cryin' shame
But you ain't got nobody else to blame

Evil woman
Evil woman
Evil woman
Evil woman

Rolled in from another town
Hit some gold, too hot to settle down
But a fool and his money soon go separate ways
You found a fool lyin' in a daze
Ha, ha, woman, what you gonna do
You destroyed all the virtues that the Lord gave you
It's so good that you're feeling pain
But you better get your face on board the very next train
Evil woman
Evil woman
Evil woman (you're an evil woman)
Evil woman

Hey, he-he-hey
Hey, he-he-hey
Hey, he-hey

Evil woman
Evil woman
Evil woman (you're an evil woman)
Evil woman

Evil woman, how you done me wrong
But now you're tryin' to wail a different song
Ha, ha, funny how you broke me up
You made the wine, now you drink the cup
I came runnin' every time you cried
Thought I saw love smilin' in your eyes
Ha, ha, very nice to know
That you ain't got no place left to go
Evil woman
Evil woman
Evil woman (you're an evil woman)
Evil woman

Evil woman
Evil woman (you're an evil woman)
Evil woman (such an evil woman)
Evil woman (you're an evil woman)
Evil woman (such an evil woman)



Every day I get in the queue (Too much, Magic Bus)
To get on the bus that takes me to you (Too much, Magic Bus)
I'm so nervous, I just sit and smile (Too much, Magic Bus)
Your house is only another mile (Too much, Magic Bus)
Thank you, driver, for getting me here (Too much, Magic Bus)
You'll be an inspector, have no fear (Too much, Magic Bus)
I don't want to cause no fuss (Too much, Magic Bus)
But can I buy your Magic Bus? (Too much, Magic Bus)
Nooooooooo!
I don't care how much I pay (Too much, Magic Bus)
I want to drive my bus to my baby each day (Too much, Magic Bus)
I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it ... (You can't have it!)
Thruppence and sixpence every day
Just to drive to my baby
Thruppence and sixpence each day
Because I drive my baby every way
Magic Bus, Magic Bus, Magic Bus
I said, now I've got my Magic Bus (Too much, Magic Bus)
I said, now I've got my Magic Bus (Too much, Magic Bus)
I drive my baby every way (Too much, Magic Bus)
Each time I go a different way (Too much, Magic Bus)
Magic Bus, Magic Bus, Magic Bus

Every day you'll see the dust (Too much, Magic Bus)
As I drive my baby in my Magic Bus (Too much, Magic Bus)
Magic Bus, Magic Bus, Magic Bus...



One man come in the name of love
One man come and go
One man come, he to justify
One man to overthrow
In the name of love
What more in the name of love
In the name of love
What more in the name of love
One man caught on a barbed wire fence
One man he resist
One man washed on an empty beach
One man betrayed with a kiss
In the name of love
What more in the name of love
In the name of love
What more in the name of love
(nobody like you...)
Early morning, april 4
Shot rings out in the memphis sky
Free at last, they took your life
They could not take your pride
In the name of love
What more in the name of love
In the name of love
What more in the name of love
In the name of love
What more in the name of love...



I'm moving through some changes
I'll never be the same
Something you did touched me
There's no one else to blame
The love we had has fallen
The love we used to share
We've given up pretending
As if you didn't care

Change, changing places
Root yourself to the ground
Capitalize on this good fortune
One word can bring you round
Changes

I look into the mirror
I see no happiness
All the warmth that I gave you
Has turned to emptiness
The love we had has fallen
The love we used to share
You've left me here believing
In love that wasn't there
Change, changing places
Root yourself to the ground
Word to the wise
Well, you get what's coming
One word can bring you round
Changes

But when I look into your eyes
And try to find out how
There's no way to save it now
And everything I feel

Changes
Keep looking for
Changes
Changes


For some reason you're questioning why
I always believe it gets better
One difference between you and I
Your heart is inside your head
One word from you, one word from me
A clear design on your liberty
Who could believe when love has gone
How we move on like everyone
Only such fools
Only such jealous hearts
Only through love changes come

Change, changing places
Root yourself to the ground
Capitalize on this good fortune
One word can bring you round
Changes

(One road to loneliness)
It's always the same
(One road to happiness)
It's calling your name
Change, changing places, changes
Root yourself to the ground
Capitalize on this good fortune
One word can bring you round
Changes
Change, changing places (changes)
Root yourself to the ground
Word to the wise
Well, you get what's coming
One word, one word can bring you round
Changes



I've been holding out so long
I've been sleeping all alone
Lord, I miss you
I've been hanging on the phone
I've been sleeping all alone
I want to kiss you sometime

Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

Well, I've been haunted in my sleep
You've been starring in my dreams
Lord, I miss you, child
I've been waiting in the hall
Been waiting on your call
When the phone rings
It's just some friends of mine that say
"Hey, what's the matter, man?
We're goingna come around at twelve
With some Puerto Rican girls thats just dying to meet you
We're goinna bring a case of wine
Hey, let's go mess and fool around
You know, like we used to"
Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah

Oh, everybody waits so long
Oh, baby, why you waitin' so long?
Won't you come on, come on?
I've been walkin' Central Park, singing after dark
People think I'm crazy
Stumbling on my feet, shuffling through the street
Asking people, "What's the matter with you, boy?"
Sometimes, I want to say to, to myself
Sometimes I say

Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, I won't miss you child

I guess I'm lying to myself
It's just you and no one else
Lord, I won't miss you, child
You've just been blotting out my mind
Fooling on my time
No, I won't miss you, baby, yeah
Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah
Lord, I miss you child
Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah
Lord, I miss you child
Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah
Why, why, why, why



Oh baby, don't it feel like heaven right now?
Don't it feel like something from a dream?
Yeah, I've never known nothing quite like this
Don't it feel like tonight might never be again?
Baby, we know better than to try and pretend
Honey no one coulda ever told me 'bout this

I said yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

The waiting is the hardest part
Every day you see one more card
You take it on faith, you take it to the heart
The waiting is the hardest part

Well yeah, I might have chased a couple women around
All it ever got me was down
Then there were those that made me feel good
But never as good as I feel right now
Baby, you're the only one that's ever known how
To make me wanna live like I wanna live now
I said yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

The waiting is the hardest part
Every day you get one more yard
You take it on faith, you take it to the heart
The waiting is the hardest part

Oh, don't let it kill you baby, don't let it get to you
Don't let it kill you baby, don't let it get to you
I'll be your bleedin' heart, I'll be your cryin' fool
Don't let this go too far, don't let it get to you

Yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

The waiting is the hardest part
Every day you get one more yard
You take it on faith, you take it to the heart
The waiting is the hardest part
Yeah, the waiting is the hardest part
Ooh
Is the hardest part
Ooh
Is the hardest part
Ooh



{Intro}
I've been thinking about our fortune
And I've decided that we're really not to blame
For the love that's deep inside us now is still the same
And the sound we make together
Is the music to the story in your eyes
It's been shining down upon you now, I realize
Listen to the tide slowly turning
Wash all our heartaches away
We are part of the fire that is burning
And from the ashes we can build another day
But I'm frightened for your children
And the life that we are living is in vain
And the sunshine we've been waiting for
Will turn to rain
{Bridge}
Listen to the tide slowly turning
Wash all our heartaches away
We are part of the fire that is burning
And from the ashes we can build another day
But I'm frightened for your children
And the life that we are living is in vain
And the sunshine we've been waiting for
Will turn to rain
When the final line is over
And it's certain that the curtain's gonna fall
I can hide inside your sweet sweet love
Forever more
{Outro}



Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us, only sky
Imagine all the people
Living for today
I

Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people
Living life in peace
You

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will be as one

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people
Sharing all the world
You
You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will live as one



You didn't have to love me like you did
But you did, but you did and I thank you
You didn't have to love me like you did
But you did, but you did and I thank you
Then you took your love to someone else
I wouldn't know what it meant
To be loved to death
You made me feel like I've never felt
Kisses so good I had to holler for help

You didn't have to squeeze but you did
But you did, but you did and I thank you
You didn't have to hold it but you did
But you did, but you did and I thank you
Every day was something new
You put on your bag and you're fine to-do
You got me trying new things too
Just so I can keep up with you

You didn't have to shake it but you did
But you did, but you did and I thank you
You didn't have to make it like you did
But you did, but you did and I thank you
All my life I've been shortchanged
Without your love baby, it's a crying shame
And now I know
What the fellas talkin’ about
When they say that they been turned out

I want  to thank you
I want to thank you
I want to thank you
Yes, I want to thank you



Have mercy, baby, on a poor girl like me
You know I'm falling, falling, falling at your feet
I'm tingling right from my head to my toes
So help me, help me, help me make the feeling go

Cause when the loving starts, and the lights go down
And there's not another living soul around
You woo me until the sun comes up
And you say that you love me

Have pity baby just when I thought it was over
Now you got me running, running, running for cover
I'm begging you for a little sympathy
And if you use me again it'll be the end of me

Cause when the loving starts, and the lights go down
And there's not another living soul around
You woo me until the sun comes up
And you say that you love me
{Instrumental Bridge}

Baby, baby, hope you're going to stay away
Cause I'm getting weaker, weaker everyday
I guess I'm not as strong as I used to be
And if you use me again it'll be the end of me

Cause when the loving starts, and the lights go down
And there's not another living soul around
You woo me until the sun comes up
And you say that you love me
Cause when the loving starts, and the lights go down
And there's not another living soul around
You woo me until the sun comes up
And you say that you love me
Say that you love me
Say that you love me

Falling, falling, falling
Falling, falling, falling...



Ohhh.. Yeah..

I feel a hunger, it's a hunger
That tries to keep a man awake at night
Are you the answer? I shouldn't wonder
When I can feel you whet my appetite
With all the power you're releasing
It isn't safe to walk the city streets alone
Anticipation is running through me
Let's find the keys and turn this engine on

I can feel you breathe
I can feel your heart beat faster (Faster)

Take me home tonight
I don't want to let you go 'til you see the light
Take me home tonight
Listen, honey, just like Ronnie sang
Be my little baby, oh, ho, oh

I get frightened in all this darkness
I get nightmares I hate to sleep alone
I need some company a guardian angel
To keep me warm when the cold winds blow
I can feel you breathe
I can feel your heart beat faster (Faster)

Take me home tonight
I don't want to let you go 'til you see the light
Take me home tonight
Listen, honey , just like Ronnie sang
Be my little baby
Be my little baby, uh-huh
Just like Ronnie sang
I said
Just like Ronnie sang
Be my little baby
Baby, my darlin', uh, uh, oh, oh, oh

I feel a hunger
It's a hunger

Take me home tonight
I don't want to let you go 'til you see the light
Take me home tonight
Listen, honey, just like Ronnie sang
Be my little baby, oh, ho, oh
Take me home tonight
I don't want to let you go 'til you see the light
Take me home tonight
Listen, honey, just like Ronnie sang
Be my little baby, oh, ho, oh

Take me home tonight
I don't want to let you go 'til you see the light
Take me home tonight
Listen, honey, just like Ronnie sang
Be my little baby, oh, ho, oh



You consider me the young apprentice
Caught between the Scylla and Charybdis
Hypnotized by you if I should linger
Staring at the ring around your finger
I have only come here seeking knowledge
Things they would not teach me of in college
I can see the destiny you sold
Turn into a shining band of gold

I'll be wrapped around your finger
I'll be wrapped around your finger

Mephistopheles is not your name
I know what you're up to just the same
I will listen hard to your tuition
You will see it come to its fruition

I'll be wrapped around your finger
I'll be wrapped around your finger

Devil and the deep blue sea behind me
Vanish in the air, you'll never find me
I will turn your face to alabaster
When you find your servant is your master
Oh, you'll be wrapped around my finger
You'll be wrapped around my finger
You'll be wrapped around my finger
Ohh



My pappy said, "Son, you're gonna' drive me to drinkin'
If you don't stop drivin' that Hot Rod Lincoln."
Have you heard this story of the Hot Rod race
When Fords and Lincolns was settin' the pace
That story is true, I'm here to say
I was drivin' that Model A
It's got a Lincoln motor and it's really souped up
That Model A body makes it look like a pup
It's got eight cylinders; uses them all
It's got overdrive, just won't stall
With a 4-barrel carb and a dual exhaust
With 4.11 gears you can really get lost
It's got safety tubes, but I ain't scared
The brakes are good, tires fair
Pulled out of San Pedro late one night
The moon and the stars was shinin' bright
We was drivin' up Grapevine Hill
Passing cars like they was standing still
All of a sudden in a wink of an eye
A Cadillac sedan passed us by
I said, "Boys, that's a mark for me!"
By then the taillight was all you could see
Now the fellas was ribbin' me for bein' behind
So I thought I'd make the Lincoln unwind
Took my foot off the gas and man alive
I shoved it on down into overdrive
Wound it up to a hundred-and-ten
My speedometer said that I hit top end
My foot was glued like lead to the floor
That's all there is and there ain't no more
Now the boys all thought I'd lost my sense
And telephone poles looked like a picket fence
They said, "Slow down! I see spots!
The lines on the road just look like dots."
Took a corner; sideswiped a truck
Crossed my fingers just for luck
My fenders was clickin' the guardrail posts
The guy beside me was white as a ghost
Smoke was comin' from out of the back
When I started to gain on that Cadillac
Knew I could catch him, I thought I could pass
Don't you know by then we'd be low on gas?
We had flames comin' from out of the side
Feel the tension. Man! What a ride!
I said, "Look out, boys, I've got a license to fly!"
And that Caddy pulled over and let us by
Now all of a sudden she started to knockin'
And down in the dips she started to rockin'
I looked in my mirror; a red light was blinkin'
The cops was after my Hot Rod Lincoln!
They arrested me and they put me in jail
And called my pappy to throw my bail
And he said, "Son, you're gonna' drive me to drinkin'
If you don't stop drivin' that Hot... Rod... Lincoln!"



I’ve learned to slam on the brake
Before I even turn the key
Before I make the mistake
Before I lead with the worst of me
Step out, step out of the sun
If you keep getting burned
Step out, step out of the sun (C-c-c-c’mon)
Because you’ve learned, because you’ve learned (Go go go go go)
I don’t wanna be a hero (On the outside always looking in)
Just wanna stay in the line (Will I ever be more than I’ve always been)
I’ll never be your Rob DeNiro (I’m tap tap tapping on the glass)
For me Joe Pesci is fine (Waving through a window woah)
And so I follow my own rules
And I use them as my tools (As my tools)
To stay alive (Stay alive)
I don’t wanna be special no no
I just wanna stay a-

Hold your breath and count the days (stay alive)
We’re graduating soon (stay alive)
College will be paradise
If i’m not dead by June
But I know I know I know (I know, I know)
Life can be beautiful (Raise a glass to freedom)
I pray I pray I pray
For a better way (Something they can never take away)
We can change back then, we can change again (No matter what they tell you)
We can be beautiful (Let's have another round tonight)

Let’s save the pitiful children
Woah (Woah)
Let’s save the pitiful children
Woah
Let’s teach the pitiful children
Who just haven’t a clue
Just what to do
He-elp them to he-e-elp you
If you lack the balls
You can go play dolls
Let your mommy fix you a snack, woah
Or you could come smoke
Pound some rum and coke in my porsche with the quarterback
Woah woah woah
I wanna be in the room where it happens, the room where it Happens (It’s my candy store, it’s my candy)
I wanna be in the room where it happens, woah (It's my candy store, it's my candy)
My god in god we trust
But we never really know what got discussed
Click boom then it happens
I will sing no requiem tonight
Why should I play the grieving girl and (Forgiveness, can you imagine?)
Lie saying that I miss you and that (Forgiveness, can you imagine?)
My world has gone dark without your light (If you see him in the street, walking by her side, talking by her side, have pity)
I will sing no requiem to
Michael in the bathroom
Michael in the bathroom at a party
Forget how long it’s been I’m just
Michael in the bathroom (Freeze your brain)
Michael in the bathroom at a party (Swim in the ice, get lost in the pain)
No you can’t come in (Forget who you are)
I’m waiting it out til' it’s time to leave (Unburden your load)
And picking at grout as I softly grieve (Forget in six weeks, you'll be back on the road)
I’m just Michael who you don’t know
Michael flying solo
Michael in the bathroom by himself
Cause all that it takes is a little
Reinvention
It’s easy to change if you give it (Dadadadada-dadadadadayada dada-da-da-dayada)
Your attention
All you gotta do is just believe
You can be who you want to be
Sincerely
(Alexander Hamilton / Christiiiiiine / Dear Evan Hansen / Ah, Heather, Heather, and Heather) Don't you want a life with
Me? (All we see is sky for forever)
Can we be seventeen? (All we see is sky for forever)
That’s all I want to do (I do, I do, I do, I do / Let the world pass by for forever this way)
If you could let me in
I could be good with you (Helpless / All we see is sky for forever)
Can we be seventeen? (Look into your eyes and the sky's the limit I'm helpless / Let the world pass by for forever)
If we still have the right (Down for the count and i'm drownin' in 'em / We could be alright for forever this way)
If you could let me in (Two friends)
I want to be with you

I still have voices in my head but now they’re just the normal kind (Woah, in your head, woah)
I still have voices in my head but now they’re just the normal kind (Woah, in your head, woah)
I still have voices in my head but now they’re just the normal kind (Woah, in your head, woah)

It's from Japan!



Holly came from Miami, FLA
Hitchhiked her way across the U.S.A
Plucked her eyebrows on the way
Shaved her legs and then he was a she

She says, "Hey babe, take a walk on the wild side"
Said, "Hey honey, take a walk on the wild side"

Candy came from out on the Island
In the backroom, she was everybody's darling
But she never lost her head
Even when she was giving head

She says, "Hey babe, take a walk on the wild side"
Said, "Hey babe, take a walk on the wild side"

And the colored girls go
Doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo

Dooh)
Little Joe never once gave it away
Everybody had to pay and pay
A hustle here and a hustle there
New York City is the place where they said

"Hey babe, take a walk on the wild side"
I said, "Hey Joe, take a walk on the wild side"

Sugar Plum Fairy came and hit the streets
Looking for soul food and a place to eat
Went to the Apollo
You should've seen him go, go, go

They said, "Hey sugar, take a walk on the wild side"
I said, "Hey babe, take a walk on the wild side"
Alright, huh

Jackie is just speeding away
Thought she was James Dean for a day
Then I guess she had to crash
Valium would've helped that bash
She said, "Hey babe, take a walk on the wild side"
I said, "Hey honey, take a walk on the wild side"

And the colored girls say
Doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo

Chicago Green, talkin' 'bout red Lebanese
A dirty room and a silver coke spoon
Give me my release, come on
Black Nepalese, it's got you weak in your knees
Seeds and dust that you got borstal
You know it's hard to believe

30 days in the hole
30 days in the hole
30 days in the hole
That's what they give you
30 days in the hole

Newcastle Brown, I'm tellin' ya, it can sure smack you down
Take a greasy whore and a rollin' dance floor
It's got your head spinnin' round
If you live on the road, well there's a new highway code
You take the urban noise with some durban poison
It's gonna lessen your load


Black Nepalese, it got you weak in your knees
Only seeds and dust that you got bust on
You know it's so hard to please
Newcastle Brown can sure smack you down
You take a greasy whore and a rollin' dance floor
You know you're jailhouse-bound



Tell us what you're gonna do tonight to mama
There must be someplace you can go
In the middle of the tall drinks and the drama
There must be someone you know
God knows you're looking good enough
But you're so smooth and the world's so rough
You might have something to lose
Oh no, pretty mama
What you gonna do in those shoes?

Got those pretty little straps around your ankles
Got those shiny little chains around your heart
You go to have your independence
But you don't know just where to start
Desperation in the singles bars
An' all those jerkoffs in their fancy cars
You can't believe your reviews
Oh no, you can't do that
Once you started wearing those shoes
{Guitar Solo}

They're looking at you, leaning on you
Tell you anything you wanna hear
They give you tablets of love
They're waiting for you
Got to score you
Handy with a shovel and so sincere
Ooh, they got the kid glove
You just want someone to talk to
They just wanna get their hands on you
You get whatever you choose
Oh, no, you can't do that
Once you started wearing those shoes
Oh, no, you can't do that
Once you started wearing those shoes
(Shoes)



You went away and left me long time ago
And now you're knockin' on my door

I hear you knockin'
But you can't come in
I hear you knockin'
Go back where you been

I begged you not to go but you said goodbye
And now you're tellin' me all your lies

I hear you knockin'
But you can't come in
I hear you knockin'
Go back where you been
Ah, yes

Ooh-hoo, ooh
Child, rave it up
Fats Domino
Smiley Lewis
Chuck Berry
Huey Smith, oh
Let's do it
You better get back to your used-to-be
'Cause your kind of love ain't good for me

I hear you knockin'
But you can't come in
I hear you knockin'
Go back where you been

I told you way back in '52
That I would never go with you

I hear you knockin'
But you can't come in
I hear you knockin'
Go back where you been
Yes

Ooh-hoo, ooh
Yes
That's a gal of gal
Ah, yes



Relax, take it easy

You see the world through your cynical eyes
You're a troubled young man I can tell
You got it all in the palm of your hand
But your hand's wet with sweat, and your head needs a rest

And you're fooling yourself if you don't believe it
You're kidding yourself if you don't believe it

Why must you be such an angry young man
When your future looks quite bright to me?
And how can there be such a sinister plan
That could hide such a lamb, such a caring young man?

And you're fooling yourself if you don't believe it
You're killing yourself if you don't believe it
Get up, (Get up!) get back on your feet
You're the one they can't beat, and you know it
Yeah, come on, (Come on!) let's see what you've got
Just take your best shot and don't blow it
Whoa whoa whoa whoa
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
And you're fooling yourself if you don't believe it
You're killing yourself if you don't believe it
Get up, (Get up!) get back on your feet
You're the one they can't beat, and you know it
Oh, come on, (Come on!) let's see what you've got
Just take your best shot and don't blow it
Whoa whoa whoa whoa
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

If you could see your way to me, come on and let me try

Let me take you home tonight
Mamma now it's alright
Let me take you home tonight

Tonight we ride, right or wrong
Tonight we sail, on a radio song
Rescue me, should I go down
If I stay too long in trouble town

Oh, yeah, you wreck me, baby
Yeah, you break me in two
But you move me, honey
Yes, you do

Now and again, I get the feeling
Well, if I don't win, I'm a-gonna break even
Rescue me, should I go wrong
If I dig too deep, if I stay too long

Oh, yeah, you wreck me, baby
Yeah, you break me in two
But you move me, honey
Yes, you do

I'll be the boy in the corduroy pants
You'll be the girl at the high school dance
Run with me, wherever I go
And just play dumb, whatever you know
Oh, yeah, you wreck me, baby
Yeah, you break me in two
But you move me, honey
Yes, you do
You wreck me, baby
Yeah, you break me in two
Oh, but you move me, honey
Ah, yes, you do



They're pickin' up the prisoners
And putting 'em in a pen
And all she wants to do is dance, dance
Rebels been rebels
Since I don't know when
And all she wants to do is dance
Molotov cocktail, the local drink
And all she wants to do is dance, dance
They mix 'em up right
In the kitchen sink
And all she wants to do is dance
Crazy people walkin' round
With blood in their eyes
And all she wants to do is dance, dance, dance
Wild-eyed pistol-wavers
Who ain't afraid to die
And all she wants to do is
All she wants to do is dance
And make romance
She can't feel the heat
Comin off the street
She wants to party
She wants to get down
All she wants to do is
All she wants to do is dance
Well the government bugged the men's room
In the local disco lounge
And all she wants to do is dance, dance
To keep the boys from sellin'
All the weapons they could scrounge
And all she wants to do is dance
But that don't keep the boys
From makin' a buck or two
And all she wants to do is dance, dance
They still can sell the army
All the drugs that they can do
And all she wants to do is
All she wants to do is dance
And make romance
Well, we barely made the airport
For the last plane out
As we taxied down the runway
I could hear the people shout
They said, "Don't come back here, Yankee"
But if I ever do
I'll bring more money
'Cause all she wants to do is dance
And make romance
Never mind the heat
Comin' off the street
She wants to party
She wants to get down
All she wants to do is
All she wants to do is dance
And make romance
All she wants to do is dance



There's no way out of here, when you come in you're in for good
There was no promise made, the part you've played, the chance you took
There are no boundaries set, the time and yet you waste it still
So it slips through your hands like grains of sand, you watch it go
There's no time to be lost, you'll pay the cost, so get it right
There's no way out of here, when you come in you're in for good
And never was there an answer, there an answer
Not without listening, without seeing
There are no answers here, when you look out you don't see in
There was no promise made, the part you've played, the chance you took
There's no way out of here, when you come in you're in for good
And never was there an answer, there an answer
Not without listening, without seeing
There's no way out of here, when you come in you're in for good
There are no answers here, when you look out you don't see in
There was no promise made, the part you've played, the chance you took
(There's no way out of here, when you come in you're in for good)
(There's no way out of here, when you come in you're in for good)
(There are no answers here, when you look out you don't see in)
(There's no way out of here, when you come in you're in for good)
(There's no way out of here, when you come in you're in for good)
(There's no way out of here...)



And if I say to you tomorrow
Take my hand, child, come with me
It's to a castle I will take you
Where what's to be, they say will be

Catch the wind, see us spin, sail away, leave today
Way up high in the sky
But the wind won't blow, you really shouldn't go
It only goes to show
That you will be mine, by taking our time

And if you say to me tomorrow
Oh what fun it all would be
Then what's to stop us, pretty baby
But what is and what should never be?

Catch the wind, see us spin, sail away, leave today
Way up high in the sky
But the wind won't blow, you really shouldn't go
It only goes to show
That you will be mine, by taking our time

So if you wake up with the sunrise
And all your dreams are still as new
And happiness is what you need so bad, girl
The answer lies with you

Catch the wind, see us spin, sail away, leave today
Way up high in the sky
But the wind won't blow, you really shouldn't go
It only goes to show
That you will be mine, by taking our time

Oh the wind won't blow and we really shouldn't go
And it only goes to show
Catch the wind, we're going to see it spin, we're going to...sail, leave today
Do do do, bop bop a do-oh. My my my my my my yeah
Everybody I know seems to know me well
But they're never going to know that I move like hell
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby. Oh lord
Baby baby babe. Huh? Oh I love ya
Do no no no no no no. C'mon now
I want you now



When you were young and your heart was an open book
You used to say “Live and let live”
(You know you did, you know you did, you know you did)
But if this ever changing world in which we're living
Makes you give in and cry

Say live and let die
(Live and let die)
Live and let die
(Live and let die)


What does it matter to you?
When you got a job to do
You got to do it well
You got to give the other fellow hell

You used to say live and let live
(You know you did, you know you did, you know you did)
But if this ever changing world in which we're living
Makes you give in and cry
Say live and let die
(Live and let die)
Live and let die
(Live and let die)



Old man, look at my life
I'm a lot like you were
Old man, look at my life
I'm a lot like you were

Old man, look at my life
Twenty-four, and there's so much more
Live alone in a paradise
That makes me think of two
Love lost, such a cost
Give me things that don't get lost
Like a coin that won't get tossed
Rolling home to you

Old man, take a look at my life
I'm a lot like you
I need someone to love me
The whole day through
Ah, one look in my eyes
And you can tell that's true

Lullabies, look in your eyes
Run around the same old town
Doesn't mean that much to me
To mean that much to you
I've been first and last
Look at how the time goes past
But I'm all alone at last
Rolling home to you
Old man, take a look at my life
I'm a lot like you
I need someone to love me
The whole day through
Ah, one look in my eyes
And you can tell that's true

Old man, look at my life
I'm a lot like you were
Old man, look at my life
I'm a lot like you were

Once was a sweet thang baby, held our love in our hands
Now I reach to kiss your lips, the touch don't mean a thing

And that's a cold shot baby, yeah that's a drag
A cold shot baby, I let our love go bad

Remember the way that you loved me, do anything I say
Now I see you out somewhere, you won't give me the time of day

And that's a cold shot darlin', yeah that's a drag
That's a cold shot baby, we let our love go bad


I really meant I was sorry, for ever causin' you pain
You showed your appreciation, by walkin' out anyway

And that's a cold shot baby, yeah that's a drag
That's a cold shot baby, we let our love go bad
So sad
Too bad
So sad
Don't let our true love run cold baby



I've seen your picture
Your name in lights above it
This is your big debut
It's like a dream come true
So won't you smile for the camera
I know they're gonna love it
Peg

I like your pin shot
I keep it with your letter
Done up in blueprint blue
It sure looks good on you
And when you smile for the camera
I know I'll love you better

Peg, it will come back to you
Peg, it will come back to you
Then the shutter falls
You see it all in 3-D
It's your favorite foreign movie

Clean shirt, new shoes
And I don't know where I am goin' to
Silk suit, black tie (black tie)
I don't need a reason why

They come runnin'
Just as fast as they can
'Cause every girl crazy
About a sharp dressed man
Gold watch, diamond ring
I ain't missin' not a single thing
Cufflinks, stick pin
When I step out
I'm gonna do you in

They come runnin'
Just as fast as they can
'Cause every girl crazy
About a sharp dressed man

Top coat, top hat
And not to worry cause my wallet's fat
Black shades, white gloves
Lookin' sharp, lookin' for love

They come runnin'
Just as fast as they can
'Cause every girl's crazy
About a sharp dressed man
That's right, real fine



She's got a smile that it seems to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky (Sky)
Now and then when I see her face
She takes me away to that special place
And if I stared too long I'd probably break down and cry

Woah-oh-oh! Sweet child o' mine
Woah, oh-oh-oh! Sweet love of mine

She's got eyes of the bluest skies
As if they thought of rain
I hate to look into those eyes and see an ounce of pain
Her hair reminds me of a warm, safe place
Where as a child I'd hide
And pray for the thunder and the rain to quietly pass me by

Woah-oh-oh! Sweet child o' mine
Ooh, oh-oh-oh! Sweet love of mine

Oh yeah! Woah-oh-oh-oh! Sweet child o' mine
Ooh-oh, oh, oh! Sweet love of mine
Woah, oh-oh-oh! Sweet child o' mine, ooh yeah
Ooh! Sweet love of mine

Where do we go?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go?
Ooh, where do we go?
Where do we go now?
Oh, where do we go now?
Where do we go? (Sweet child...)
Ooh, where do we go now?
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
Where do we go now? Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, wow
Where do we go?
Oh, where do we go now?
Oh, where do we go?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go?
Ooh, where do we go now?
Now, now, now, now, now, now, now
Sweet child, sweet child o' mine



Mmm, yeah

Women think I'm tasty, but they're always tryin' to waste me
And make me burn the candle right down
But baby, baby, I don't need no jewels in my crown
'Cause all you women is low down gamblers
Cheatin' like I don't know how
But baby, I go crazy, there's fever in the funk house now
This low down bitchin' got my poor feet a-itchin'
You know you know the deuce is still wild

Baby, I can't stay, you got to roll me
And call me the tumbling dice

Always in a hurry, I never stop to worry
Don't see the time flashin' by
Honey, got no money
I'm all sixes and sevens and nines
Say now, baby, I'm the rank outsider
You can be my partner in crime

Baby, I can't stay
You got to roll me and call me the tumbling
Roll me and call me the tumbling dice
Baby, oh my
Oh, my, my, my, I'm the lone craps shooter
Playing the field every night

Baby, get it straight
You got to roll me and call me the tumbling dice
Got to roll me (Call me the tumbling dice)
Got to roll me
Got to roll me
Got to roll me (Oh, oh yeah)
Got to roll me (Oh, oh)
Got to roll me (Oh yeah)
Got to roll me (Oh, keep on rolling)
Got to roll me (Oh, keep on rolling)
Got to roll me (Oh yeah, keep on rolling)
Got to roll me (Call me the tumbling dice)
Got to roll me (Yeah)
Got to roll me (Roll me, baby)
Got to roll me (Ah yeah)
Got to roll me (Oh my, my, my, my)
Got to roll me
Got to roll me (Keep on tumbling down, baby, oh)
Got to roll me
Got to roll me
Got to roll me



One morning I woke up and I knew
You were really gone
A new day, a new way, I knew
I should see it along
Go your way, I'll go mine
And carry on

The sky is clearing and the night
Has gone out
The sun, he come, the world
Is all full of love
Rejoice, rejoice, we have no choice
But to carry on

The fortunes of fables are able
To sing the song
Now witness the quickness with which
We get along
To sing the blues you've got to live the dues
And carry on

Carry on
Love is coming
Love is coming to us all


Where are you going now, my love?
Where will you be tomorrow?
Will you bring me happiness?
Will you bring me sorrow?

Oh, the questions of a thousand dreams
What you do with what you see
Lover, can you talk to me?

Girl, when I was on my own
Chasing you down
What was it made you run?
Trying your best just to get around

The questions of a thousand dreams
What you do and what you see
Lover, can you talk to me?



She's a good girl, loves her mama
Loves Jesus and America too
She's a good girl, crazy 'bout Elvis
Loves horses and her boyfriend too
It's a long day, livin' in Reseda
There's a freeway, runnin' through the yard
And I'm a bad boy, 'cause I don't even miss her
I'm a bad boy for breakin' her heart

And I'm free, free fallin'
Yeah I'm free, free fallin'

All the vampires, walkin' through the valley
Move west down Ventura Boulevard
And all the bad boys are standing in the shadows
And the good girls are home with broken hearts

And I'm free, I'm free fallin'
Yeah I'm free, free fallin'
(Free fallin', I'm-a free fallin', I'm-a
Free fallin', I'm-a free fallin', I'm-a)
I wanna glide down over Mulholland
I wanna write her name in the sky
I'm gonna free fall out into nothin'
Gonna leave this world for a while

Now I'm free, free fallin'
(Free fallin', I'm-a free fallin', I'm-a
Free fallin', I'm-a free fallin', I'm-a)
Yeah I'm free, free fallin'
(Free fallin', I'm-a free fallin', I'm-a
Free fallin', I'm-a free fallin', I'm-a)

(Free fallin', I'm-a free fallin', I'm-a)
Yeah I'm free, free fallin'
Oh!
(Free fallin', I'm-a free fallin', I'm-a)
Free fallin'
(Free fallin', I'm-a free fallin', I'm-a)
And I'm free, oh, free fallin'
(Free fallin', I'm-a free fallin', I'm-a
Free fallin', I'm-a free fallin', I'm-a)
Free fallin'
(Free fallin', I'm-a free fallin', I'm-a)



Blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night
Blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night
Blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night

Madman drummers bummers
Indians in the summer with a teenage diplomat
In the dumps with the mumps as the adolescent pumps
His way into his hat
With a boulder on my shoulder, feelin' kinda older
I tripped the merry-go-round
With this very unpleasin', sneezin' and wheezin'
The calliope crashed to the ground
The calliope crashed to the ground!

But she was blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night
Blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night
Blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night
Blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night
Some silicone sister with a manager mister
Told me I got what it takes
She said "I'll turn you on sonny to something strong
Play the song with the funky break"
And go-cart Mozart was checkin' out the weather chart
To see if it was safe outside
And little Early-Pearly came by in his curly-wurly
And asked me if I needed a ride
Asked me if I needed a ride!

But she was blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night
Blinded by the light

She got down but she never got tired
She's gonna make it through the night
She's gonna make it through the night


But mama, that's where the fun is
But mama, that's where the fun is
Mama always told me not to look into the eyes of the sun
But mama, that's where the fun is
Some brimstone baritone anticyclone rolling stone
Preacher from the east
Says, "Dethrone the dictaphone, hit it in it's funny bone
That's where they expect it least"
And some new-mown chaperone was standin' in the corner
Watching the young girls dance
And some fresh-sown moonstone was messin' with his frozen zone
Reminding him of romance
The calliope crashed to the ground

But she was blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night
Blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night

Blinded by the light
(Madman drummers bummers, Indians in the summer)
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night
(With a teenage diplomat)
Blinded by the light
(In the dumps with the mumps as the adolescent pumps)
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night
(His way into his hat)
Blinded by the light
(With a boulder on my shoulder, feelin' kinda older)
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night
(I tripped the merry-go-round)
Blinded by the light
(With this very unpleasin', sneezin' and wheezin)
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night
(The calliope crashed to the ground)
Blinded by the light
(Now Scott with a slingshot finally found a tender spot)
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night
(And throws his lover in the sand)
Blinded by the light
(And some bloodshot forget-me-not said daddy's within earshot)
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night
(Save the buckshot, turn up the band)
Blinded by the light
(Some silicone sister with a manager mister)
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night
(Told me I got what it takes)
Blinded by the light
(She said, "I'll turn you on sonny to something strong")
She got down, but she never got tired
She's gonna make it through the night



Us (Us, us, us, us, us) and them (Them, them, them, them)
And after all we're only ordinary men
Me (Me, me, me, me, me) and you (You, you, you, you, you)
God only knows it's not what we would choose to do
"Forward" he cried from the rear
And the front rank died
The general sat and the lines on the map
Moved from side to side

Black (Black, black, black, black) and blue (Blue, blue, blue, blue)
And who knows which is which and who is who
Up (Up, up, up, up, up) and down (Down, down, down, down)
And in the end it's only round and round, and round
"Haven't you heard it's a battle of words?"
The poster bearer cried
"Listen, son," said the man with the gun
"There's room for you inside"

I mean, they're not gonna kill ya
So like, if you give 'em a quick short, sharp, shock
They won't do it again
Dig it? I mean he got off lightly
'Cause I would've given him a thrashing
I only hit him once!
It was only a difference of opinion
But really, I mean good manners don't cost nothing do they, eh?

Down (Down, down, down, down) and out (Out, out, out, out)
It can't be helped but there's a lot of it about
With (With, with, with, with), without
And who'll deny it's what the fighting's all about?
Out of the way, it's a busy day
I've got things on my mind
For want of the price of tea and a slice
The old man died



I met you on somebody's island
You thought you had known me before
I brought you a crate of papaya
They waited all night by your door
You probably wouldn't remember
I probably couldn't forget
Jungle love in the surf in the pouring rain
Everything's better when wet

Jungle love, it's driving me mad
It's making me crazy
Jungle love, it's driving me mad
It's making me crazy

But lately, you live in the jungle
I never see you alone
But we need some definite answers
So I thought I would write you a poem
The question to everyone's answer
Is usually asked from within
But the patterns of the rain
And the truth they contain
Have written my life on your skin
Jungle love, it's driving me mad
It's making me crazy, crazy
Jungle love, it's driving me mad
It's making me crazy

You treat me like I was your ocean
You swim in my blood when it's warm
My cycles of circular motion
Protect you and keep you from harm
You live in a world of illusion
Where everything's peaches and cream
We all face a scarlet conclusion
But we spend our time in a dream

Jungle love, it's driving me mad
It's making me crazy, crazy
Jungle love, it's driving me mad
It's making me crazy, crazy

Jungle love, it's driving me mad
It's making me crazy, crazy
Jungle love, it's driving me mad
It's making me crazy



Under my thumb the girl who once had me down
Under my thumb the girl who once pushed me around

It's down to me
The difference in the clothes she wears
Down to me, the change has come
She's under my thumb
Ain't it the truth, babe?

Under my thumb the squirming dog who's just had her day
Under my thumb a girl who has just changed her ways

It's down to me, yes it is
The way she does just what she's told
Down to me, the change has come
She's under my thumb
Ah, ah, say it's alright

Under my thumb is a Siamese cat of a girl
Under my thumb she's the sweetest, hmmm, pet in the world
It's down to me
The way she talks when she's spoken to
Down to me, the change has come
She's under my thumb

Ah, take it easy babe
Yeah

It's down to me, oh yeah
The way she talks when she's spoken to
Down to me, the change has come
She's under my thumb
Yeah, it feels alright

Under my thumb her eyes are just kept to herself
Under my thumb, well I, I can still look at someone else

It's down to me, oh that's what I said
The way she talks when she's spoken to
Down to me, the change has come
She's under my thumb
Say, it's alright
Say it's all...
Say it's all...
Take it easy babe
Take it easy babe
It feels alright
Take it, take it easy, babe



Eddie waited 'til he finished high school
He went to Hollywood, got a tattoo
He met a girl out there with a tattoo, too
The future was wide open
They moved into a place they both could afford
He found a night club he could work at the door
She had a guitar and she taught him some chords
The sky was the limit

Into the great wide open
Under them skies of blue
Out in the great wide open
A rebel without a clue

The papers said Ed always played from the heart
He got an agent and a roadie named Bart
They made a record and it went in the charts
The sky was the limit
His leather jacket had chains that would jingle
They both met movie stars, partied and mingled
Their A&R man said, "I don't hear a single"
The future was wide open (Oh)
Into the great wide open
Under them skies of blue
Out in the great wide open
A rebel without a clue
Into the great wide open
Under them skies of blue
Into the great wide open
A rebel without a clue (Ayy)



It's getting to the point where I'm no fun anymore
I am sorry
Sometimes it hurts so badly, I must cry out loud
"I am lonely"

I am yours, you are mine
You are what you are
You make it hard

Remember what we've said and done and felt about each other
Oh babe, have mercy
Don't let the past remind us of what we are not now
I am not dreaming

I am yours, you are mine
You are what you are
You make it hard


Tearing yourself away from me now--you are free
And I am crying
This does not mean I don't love you--I do, that's forever
Yes and for always
I am yours, you are mine
You are what you are
You make it hard

Something inside is telling me that I've got your secret
Are you still listening?
Fear is the lock and laughter the key to your heart
And I love you

I am yours, you are mine
You are what you are
You make it hard
And you make it hard
And you make it hard
And you make it hard

Friday evening, Sunday in the afternoon
What have you got to lose?
Tuesday morning, please be gone, I'm tired of you
What have you got to lose?
Can I tell it like it is? (help me, I'm suffering)
Listen to me, baby
It's my heart that's suffering, it's a-dying (help me, I'm suffering)
And that's what I have to lose

I've got an answer
I'm going to fly away
What have I got to lose?
Will you come see me Thursdays and Saturdays?
What have you got to lose?


Chestnut brown canary
Ruby throated sparrow
Sing a song, don't be long
Thrill me to the marrow
Voices of the angels
Ring around the moonlight
Asking me, said she's so free
How can you catch the sparrow?
Lacy, lilting lyrics
Losing love, lamenting
Change my life, make it right
Be my lady

Tear drops on the city
Bad Scooter searching for his groove
Seem like the whole world walking pretty
And you can't find the room to move
Well everybody better move over, that's all
'Cause I'm running on the bad side
And I got my back to the wall
Tenth Avenue freeze-out, Tenth Avenue freeze-out

I was stranded in the jungle
Tryin' to take in all the heat they was giving
The night is dark but the sidewalks bright
And lined with the light of the living
From a tenement window a transistor blasts
Turn around the corner things got real quiet real fast
I walked into a Tenth Avenue freeze-out
Tenth Avenue freeze-out

And I'm all alone, I'm all alone
And kid you better get the picture
And I'm on my own, I'm on my own
And I can't go home
When the change was made uptown
And the Big Man joined the band
From the coastline to the city
All the little pretties raise their hands
I'm gonna sit back right easy and laugh
When Scooter and the Big Man bust this city in half
With a Tenth Avenue freeze-out, tenth avenue freeze-out
Tenth avenue freeze-out



Looking out at the road rushing under my wheels
Looking back at the years gone by like so many summer fields
'65, I was 17 and running up 101
I don't know where I'm running now, I'm just running on

Running on, running on empty
Running on, running blind
Running on, running into the sun
But I'm running behind

Gotta do what you can just to keep your love alive
Trying not to confuse it with what you do to survive
'69, I was 21 and I called the road my own
I don't know when that road turned into the road I'm on

Running on, running on empty
Running on, running blind
Running on, running into the sun
But I'm running behind
Everyone I know, everywhere I go
People need some reason to believe
I don't know about anyone but me
If it takes all night, that'll be all right
If I can get you to smile before I leave

Looking out at the road rushing under my wheels
I don't know how to tell you all just how crazy this life feels
Look around for the friends that I used to turn to to pull me through
Looking into their eyes I see them running, too

Running on, running on empty
Running on, running blind
Running on, running into the sun
But I'm running behind

Honey, you really tempt me
You know the way you look so kind
I'd love to stick around but I'm running behind
(Running on)
You know I don't even know what I'm hoping to find
(Running blind)
Running into the sun but I'm running behind
Thank you!



I wonder how you're feeling
There's ringing in my ears
And no one to relate to 'cept the sea
Who can I believe in?
I'm kneeling on the floor
There has to be a force
Who do I phone?

The stars are out and shining
But all I really want to know

Oh, won't you show me the way
I want you to show me the way, yeah

Well, I can see no reason
You're living on your nerves
When someone drops a cup, and I submerge
I'm swimming in a circle
I feel I'm going down
There has to be a fool to play my part

Someone thought of healing
But all I really want to know
Oh, won't you show me the way
I want you to show me the way
I want you day after day, yeah

Yeah, I wonder if I'm dreaming
I feel so unashamed
I can't believe this is happening to me

I watch you when you're sleeping
And then I want to take your love

Oh, won't you show me the way
I want you to show me the way
I want you day after day, yeah
I want you day after day, hey



(Ah yeah!)

There's a red house over yonder
That's where my baby stays
Lord, there's a red house over yonder
Lord, that's where my baby stays
I ain't been home to see my baby
In ninety nine and one half days

Wait a minute, something's wrong here
The key won't unlock this door
Wait a minute, something's wrong
Lord have mercy, this key won't unlock this door
Somethings goin' on here
I have a bad, bad feeling
That my baby don't live here no more
(That's alright I still got my guitar, look out now!)

Well I might as well go on over yonder
Way back up on the hill
(I got something to do)
Lord, I might as well go back over yonder
Way back yonder 'cross the hill
'Cause if my baby don't love me no more
I know her sister will!



I took my love, took it down
I climbed a mountain, and I turned around
And I saw my reflection in the snow-covered hills
Till the landslide brought me down

Oh, mirror in the sky, what is love?
Can the child within my heart rise above?
Can I sail through the changing ocean tides?
Can I handle the seasons of my life?
Hmmmm

Well, I've been afraid of changing
'Cause I've built my life around you
But time makes you bolder, even children get older
And I'm getting older too


Well, I've been afraid of changing
'Cause I've built my life around you
But time makes you bolder, even children get older
And I'm getting older too
Oh, I'm getting older too
I take my love, take it down
Oh, climb a mountain and turn around
And If you see my reflection in the snow-covered hills
Well, the landslide will bring you down

And If you see my reflection in the snow covered hills
Well, the landslide will bring you down
Oh, the landslide will bring it down

Caught up in a whirlwind, can't catch my breath
Knee deep in hot water, broke out in cold sweat
Can't catch a turtle, in this rat race
Feels like I'm losing time, at a breakneck pace
Afraid of my own shadow, in the face of grace
Heart full of darkness, spotlight on my face
There was love all around me, but I was looking for revenge
Thank God it never found me, would have been the end

Walkin' the tight rope, steppin' on my friends
Walkin' the tight rope, was a shame and a sin
Walkin' the tight rope, between wrong and right
Walkin' the tight rope, both day and night

Lookin' back in front of me, in the mirror's grin
Through eyes of love I see, I'm really lookin' at a friend
We've had all our problems, that's the way life is
My heart goes out to others, who are there to make amends

We have been walkin' the tightrope, trying to make it right
Walkin' the tightrope every day and every night
Walkin' the tightrope bring it all around
Walkin' the tightrope from the lost to found
Walkin' the tightrope stretched around the world
Walkin' the tightrope save the boys and girls
Walkin' the tightrope let's make it right
Walkin' the tightrope do it, do it tonight
Walkin' the tightrope



Mississippi queen
If you know what I mean
Mississippi queen
She taught me everything

Way down around Vicksburg, around Louisiana way
There lived the Cajun lady aboard the Mississippi Queen
You know she was a dancer, she moved better on wine

While the rest of them dudes were getting their kicks
Boy, I beg your pardon, I was getting mine

Mississippi queen
If you know what I mean
Mississippi queen
She taught me everything

This lady she asked me if I would be her man
You know that I told her I'd do what I can
To keep her looking pretty, buy her dresses that shine
While the rest of them dudes were making their friends
Boy, I beg your pardon, I was losing mine


You know she was a dancer, she moved better on wine
While the rest of them dudes were getting their kicks
Boy, I beg your pardon, I was getting mine

Oh, Mississippi Queen



Ooh

Hey kid, you boogie too, did ya?

Jump up and down in them blue suede shoes

Still looking for that blue jean, baby queen
Prettiest girl I ever seen
See her shake on the movie screen

Mother, do you think they'll drop the bomb?
Mother, do you think they'll like this song?
Mother, do you think they'll try to break my balls?
Ooh-ah, Mother, should I build the wall?

Mother, should I run for president?
Mother, should I trust the government?
Mother, will they put me in the firing line?
Ooh-ah, is it just a waste of time?
Hush now, baby, baby, don't you cry
Mamma's gonna make all of your nightmares come true
Mamma's gonna put all of her fears into you
Mamma's gonna keep you right here, under her wing
She won't let you fly, but she might let you sing
Mamma's gonna keep baby cosy and warm

Ooh babe, ooh babe, ooh babe
Of course, Mamma's gonna help build the wall

Mother, do you think she's good enough... For me?
Mother, do you think she's dangerous... To me?
Mother, will she tear your little boy apart?
Ooh-ah, Mother, will she break my heart?

Hush now, baby, baby, don't you cry
Mamma's gonna check out all your girlfriends for you
Mamma won't let anyone dirty get through
Mamma's gonna wait up until you get in
Mamma will always find out where you've been
Mamma's gonna keep baby healthy and clean

Ooh babe, ooh babe, ooh babe
You'll always be "baby" to me

Mother, did it need to be so high?



I shot the sheriff, but I did not shoot the deputy
I shot the sheriff, but I did not shoot the deputy

All around in my home town
They're trying to track me down
They say they want to bring me in guilty
For the killing of a deputy
For the life of a deputy
But I say

I shot the sheriff, but I swear it was in self-defense
I shot the sheriff, and they say it is a capital offense

Sheriff John Brown always hated me
For what I don't know
Every time that I plant a seed
He said, "Kill it before it grows"
He said, "Kill it before it grows"
I say

Freedom came my way one day
And I started out of town
All of a sudden I see sheriff John Brown
Aiming to shoot me down
So I shot, I shot him down
I say


Reflexes got the better of me
And what is to be must be
Every day the bucket goes to the well
But one day the bottom will drop out
Yes, one day the bottom will drop out
But I say



{Intro}
Just as I thought, it was going alright
I found out I'm wrong, when I thought I was right
It's always the same, it's just a shame, that's all
I could say day, and you'd say night
Tell me it's black, when I know that it's white
Always the same, it's just a shame, and that's all
I could leave, but I won't go
Though my heart might tell me so
I can't feel a thing from my head down to my toes
But why does it always seem to be
Me looking at you, you looking at me
It's always the same, it's just a shame, that's all
Turning me on, turning me off
Making me feel like I want too much
Living with you is just putting me through it all of the time
Running around, staying out all night
Taking it all instead of taking one bite
Living with you is just putting me through it all of the time
I could leave, but I won't go
But it'd be easier I know
I can't feel a thing from my head down to my toes
But why does it always seem to be
Me looking at you, you looking at me
It's always the same, it's just a shame, that's all
Truth is I love you, more than I wanted to
There's no point in trying to pretend
There's been no one who makes me feel like you do
Say we'll be together 'til the end
{Bridge}
I could leave but I won't go
It would be easier, I know
I can't feel a thing from my head down to my toes
So why does it always seem to be
Me looking at you, you looking at me
It's always the same, it's just a shame, that's all
But I love you, more than I wanted to
There's no point in trying to pretend
There's been no one who makes me feel like you do
Say we'll be together' til the end
But just as I thought it was going alright
I found out I'm wrong when I thought I was right
It's always the same, it's just a shame, that's all
Well I could say day, and you'd say night
You tell me it's black when I know that it's white
It's always the same, it's just a shame, that's all
That's all
{Outro}



Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak
Somewhere in this town
See me and the boys, we don't like it
So we're getting up and going down
Hiding low looking right to left
If you see us coming I think it's best
To move away do you hear what I say
From under my breath
Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak
Somewhere in the town
Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak
So don't you be around
Don't you be around
Tonight there's gonna be trouble
Some of us won't survive
See the boys and me mean business
Busting out dead or alive
I can hear the hound dogs on my trail
All hell breaks loose, alarm and sirens wail
Like the game if you lose
Go to jail
Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak
Somewhere in the town
Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak
So don't you be around
Tonight there's gonna be trouble
I'm gonna find myself in
Tonight there's gonna be trouble
So woman, stay with a friend
You know it's safer
Breakout
Tonight there's gonna be a breakout
Into the city zones
Don't you dare to try and stop us
No one could for long
Searchlight on my trail
Tonight's the night all systems fail
Hey you, good looking female
Come here
Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak
Somewhere in the town
Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak
So don't you be around
Tonight there's gonna be trouble
I'm gonna find myself in
Tonight there's gonna be trouble
So woman stay with a friend



Well, I won't back down
No, I won't back down
You can stand me up at the gates of hell
But I won't back down
No, I'll stand my ground
Won't be turned around
And I'll keep this world from draggin' me down
Gonna stand my ground
And I won't back down

I won't back down
Hey baby, there ain't no easy way out
I won't back down
Hey I will stand my ground
And I won't back down

Well I know what's right
I got just one life
In a world that keeps on pushin' me around
But I'll stand my ground
And I won't back down

I won't back down
Hey baby, there ain't no easy way out
I won't back down
Hey, I will stand my ground
(I won't back down)
And I won't back down

I won't back down
Hey baby, there ain't no easy way out
I won't back down
Hey, I won't back down
I won't back down
Hey baby, there ain't no easy way out
I won't back down
Hey, I will stand my ground
(I won't back down)
And I won't back down
(I won't back down)
No, I won't back down



He was a hard-headed man
He was brutally handsome, and she was terminally pretty
She held him up, and he held her for ransom in the heart
Of the cold, cold city
He had a nasty reputation as a cruel dude
They said he was ruthless, they said he was crude
They had one thing in common, they were good in bed
She'd say, "Faster, faster. The lights are turnin' red."

Life in the fast lane, Surely makes you lose your mind
Life in the fast lane, Huh
Are you with me so far?

Eager for action and hot for the game
The coming attraction, the drop of a name
They knew all the right people, they took all the right pills
They threw outrageous parties, they paid heavenly bills
There were lines on the mirror, lines on her face
She pretended not to notice, she was caught up in the race
Out every evening, until it was light
He was too tired to make it, she was too tired to fight about it

Life in the fast lane, Surely makes you lose your mind
Life in the fast lane, Huh
Life in the fast lane, Everything all the time
Life in the fast lane, Huh
Blowin' and burnin', blinded by thirst
They didn't see the stop sign, took a turn for the worst
She said, "Listen, baby, you can hear the engine ring."
"We've been up and down this highway, haven't seen a goddamn thing."
He said, "Call the doctor. I think I'm gonna crash."
"The doctor says he's comin', but you gotta pay in cash."
They went rushin' down that freeway, messed around and got lost
They didn't care, they were just dyin' to get off

And it was life in the fast lane, Surely makes you lose your mind
Life in the fast lane, Huh
Life in the fast lane, Everything all the time
Life in the fast lane, Huh

Life in the fast lane
Life in the fast lane

If you want me to
Oh, if you want me to

If you want to



Goodbye, Norma Jeane
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on the treadmill
And they made you change your name

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would've liked to know you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

Loneliness was tough
The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid
And even when you died
Oh, the press still hounded you
All the papers had to say
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would've liked to know you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

Goodbye, Norma Jeane
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
Goodbye, Norma Jeane
From the young man in the 22nd row
Who sees you as something more than sexual
More than just our Marilyn Monroe

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would've liked to know you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did



Babe, baby, baby, I'm gonna leave you

You made me happy every single day
But now I've got to go away
Oh, oh, oh

Baby, baby, baby, baby
That's when it's calling me
I said that's when it's calling me back home



Hey, hey, you
Tell me how have you been?

You could have a steam train
If you just lay down your tracks
You could have an aeroplane flying
If you bring your blue sky back
All you do is call me
I'll be anything you need

You could have a big dipper
Going up and down, all around the bends
You could have a bumper car, bumping
This amusement never ends

I wanna be your sledgehammer
Why don't you call my name?
Oh, let me be your sledgehammer
This will be my testimony

Show me 'round your fruit cage
'Cause I will be your honey bee
Open up your fruit cage
Where the fruit is as sweet as can be
I wanna be your sledgehammer
Why don't you call my name?
You'd better call the sledgehammer
Put your mind at rest
I'm going to be the sledgehammer
This can be my testimony
I'm your sledgehammer
Let there be no doubt about it

Sledge, sledge
Sledgehammer

Layla, ich hab gerade noch dein Lied gehört
Und dann warst du in der Bahn
Im selben Abteil wie ich
Layla, wieso denk ich ohne dich zu kennen
Dass du schon immer da warst
Doch weil du plötzlich ausgestiegen bist
Kenn ich deinen richtigen Namen nicht
Oh oh oh
Egal was ich mach ich frag mich wer sie ist
Oh oh oh
Und warum ich ihr Lächeln so vermiss
Oh oh oh
Ich steig wieder ein und hoffe sie ist da
Oh oh oh
Oder nur noch Eric Clapton in der Bar
Layla, ich kann nicht vergessen wie du da drüben sasst und in die Luft gelächelt hast
Layla, was hast du mit meinem Kopf gemacht
Wieso hab ich nichts gesagt als du mich angesehen hast
Hab ich kein Wort rausgebracht
Oh oh oh
Egal was ich mach ich frag mich wer sie ist
Oh oh oh
Und warum ich ihr Lächeln so vermiss
Oh oh oh
Ich steig wieder ein und hoffe sie ist da
Oh oh oh
Oder nur noch Eric Clapton in der Bar
Layla, was hast du mit meinem Kopf gemacht?
Layla, Layla
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Egal was ich mach ich frag mich wer sie ist
Oh oh oh
Und warum ich ihr Lächeln so vermiss
Oh oh oh
Ich steig wieder ein und hoffe sie ist da
Oh oh oh
Oder nur noch Eric Clapton in der Bar
Oder nur noch Eric Clapton in der Bar
Oder nur noch Eric Clapton in der Bar



Yeah, you got satin shoes
Yeah, you got plastic boots
Y'all got cocaine eyes
Yeah, you got speed-freak jive, now
Can't you hear me knockin' on your window?
Can't you hear me knockin' on your door?
Can't you hear me knockin' down your dirty street?
Yeah

Help me baby, ain't no stranger
Help me baby, ain't no stranger
Help me baby, ain't no stranger

Can't you hear me knockin', ahh, are you safe asleep?
Can't you hear me knockin', yeah, down the gas light street, now
Can't you hear me knockin', yeah, throw me down the keys
Alright now

I've been begging on my knees
I've been kickin', help me please

Hear me growlin'

I need you to need me
I'd love you to love me
I'm beggin' you to beg me

I want you to want me
I need you to need me
I'd love you to love me

I'll shine up the old brown shoes, put on a brand-new shirt
I'll get home early from work if you say that you love me

Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you cryin'?
Oh, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you cryin'?
Feelin' all alone without a friend, you know you feel like dyin'
Oh, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you cryin'?

I want you to want me
I need you to need me
I'd love you to love me
I'm beggin' you to beg me



One of these nights
One of these crazy old nights
We're gonna find out, pretty mama
What turns on your lights

The full moon is calling, the fever is high
And the wicked wind whispers and moans
You got your demons
And you got desires
Well, I got a few of my own

Ooh, someone to be kind to
In between the dark and the light
Ooh, coming right behind you
Swear I'm gonna find you one of these nights

One of these dreams
One of these lost and lonely dreams, now
We're gonna find one
Oh, one that really screams

I've been searching for the daughter of the devil himself
I've been searching for an angel in white
I've been waiting for a woman who's a little of both
And I can feel her but she's nowhere in sight
Ooh, loneliness will blind you
In between the wrong and the right (oh, oh, oh)
Ooh, coming right behind you
Swear I'm gonna find you one of these nights


One of these nights
Mmm, In between the dark and the light
Comin' right behind you
Swear I'm gonna find you
Get you baby one of these nights
One of these nights
Hoo, hoo hoo
Hoo, hoo hoo
One of these nights
I, I can feel it
I can feel it
One of these nights
Comin' right behind you
Swear I'm gonna find you now
One of these nights
Baby, it gets so dark
So dark and cold alone
One of these nights
One of these crazy, crazy, crazy nights
One of these nights
Swear I'm gonna find you
Comin' right behind you, now
One of these nights
Hoo, hoo hoohoohoo
One of these nights
All I wanna say, ahhh
One of these nights



Please, this shit's so fucking hard
Helluva Beats
Yeah, ayy, ayy

Thirty-thousand words in a rap, that's a first, and, in fact, that's the most in the world on a track
Yeah, I've been searchin' the map, for like any other person who could work it like that
Do it perfectly slow and then perfectly fast, I'm the only one that's out here, and I'm certain of that
Play me a beat, it gets turned into ash, if I play you a beat, it gets turned into trash
Ayy, hold up, wait, when I'm on the track, I make no mistakes
I can do the shit for like thirty-thousand hours, fuck thirty-thousand words, I don't slow my breaks
I go UK, then I make so many pounds, everybody think I'm overweight
Gettin' bread, see me eatin', but I gotta go in, better hold my plate
Ooh, ooh, gotta switch up, I'm so godly, I'm the bishop
Now these haters wanna link up, my bars make them get the hiccups
So I had to run it up real quick, freestyle, gotta do some real shit real quick
Everything I do is real big 'cause I gotta get the crowd to feel this,  real lit, real shit
Nowadays, they write me and I don't write it back, see my future demons like a psychic and a psychopath
Swear I'm drivin' down the road and I might've crashed, do the dash, always movin', don't know where to find me at
Hey, movin' on, gotta find a team, earnin' all my stripes like Camilla, but I'm lima beans
All these rappers 'bout to get fucked like they Riley Reid, I'm your teacher, so be quiet or I am assignin' seats
Pioneer to the shit, Leif Eriksson, I was even hunted, 2012, like I'm Jerry Lynn
All these places got me sneezin', need a Claritin, until I fall off next year, I'ma be arrogant
Yeah, I'm runnin' all this shit, run it up, yeah, you know that I be comin' up for a hun'ed bucks
At the start, all I wanted was like thirty-thousand hits, got bored, add a couple zeroes for the shits
Why not? Look what I got, look what I bought, camera is my true eye, I'm a side-clause
Shoes, they go too high, only high-tops, fuck yeah, I'm the new guy, what am I on?
Come in, Jaden Smith, I'm a motherfuckin' icon, boy, I'm too cold, I don't even have on my ice on
Too lit, I don't even have the mic on, and I'm too bright, I don't even have the lights on
Better wait up, shit's too easy, like a layup
And my bitch too entertainin', see the note, you gotta stay up
Takin' bets on that I'll fail, it's time to pay up
Now you tryna hide your face, I'm pretty sure that that ain't make-up, uh
I'm droppin' hits to get the world records, who's your favorite artist, 'cause I'm sure better?
Well maybe not, but I tried, though, Post Malone, I go psycho
Leave you a stink, like a rhino, 'cause I rap beef, no gyro
And I rhyme fast and I rhyme slow, turned my L's into W's; typo
Uh, hop into the track, give you the love and you give it right back
Ten different flows I be spittin', some trap and some other shit get in it's get on the map
Done this for like a year, and now, my writing's clear, I've been gettin' respect, 'cause now I am here
And I'm here to stay, did you hear me say, "I'm not here to play"?
"He got a flow and a voice now, I remember when he choki'g a boy out
But he's back in showin' no choice now, don't you know that he's gonna destroy now?"
So I'm gonna get there, and I know how, cut his beat, I'll be blaring 'em so loud
We'll be talk about bitches and money, this shit is so funny, my parents are so proud, damn
I'm startin' to try, tryin' the shots at it, look at the ground and see stars in the sky
Drawin' the line, all of you rappers are dizzy, I can see the stars in your eyes
You're probably high, if you think that you compare to me, it must be part of the lines
Copyin' guys, you better send all those beats back to Future, like Marty McFly
Thirty-thousand words on a track, lil' bitch, now these people turn my vid on and react, lil' bitch
Know I got the clout, I got the stats, lil' bitch, and you givin' me a headache, where's the Advil, bitch?
But I'm doin' all I can, and I did it in the past-tense, makin' all this money up off of YouTube off me AdSense
Money up off of YouTube off AdSense, all of you are wack, that's a fact, I'ma rap then
And I rap, huh, I'm a laptop, Eminem holds the world record for "Rap God"
1.6K words, though, we already have that topped
And we'll do it for another hour, and I'm underrated and I'm underpowered
My bars are so filthy, all of y'all need to take another shower
For every fan, there's a hundred doubters, and they let me know up in the comments
But you know that we ain't done, 'cause I gotta talk my nonsense
And I gotta keep it clean, uh, do exactly what my mom says
And I know when they headed for the top, and we still be makin' progress
I can spit bars for nine months, then deliver you a new life
Yeah, we eatin' in this bitch, uh, all y'all better take a huge bite
And I didn't even write that shit, 'cause I freestyle, you still like that shit
See my video, press 'like' on it, that subscribe button? Better wipe that shit
I'm getting tired of this beat, I think it's time to change it
'Cause I'll spaz on trap, old school boom-bap, you name it
Think of that as a intro, now we get into the meat of it
This some shit you didn't see comin', I don't give a fuck 'bout what you think of it!

Heh, ayy!
Ayy, ayy
Uh, switch up
Yeah, ayy, ayy, ayy

Look out the window, see past it, but we're faintin' reflections
You never laugh like you used to, you've got fainter expressions
You headin' down the wrong path and they changin' directions
Maybe don't mention 'bout how I made me your blessin'
And lately, I question the shit that was taught to me
I'm awkwardly stoppin' these conversations
Hey, how long you waitin' till the day you wake up and thank God you made it?
I don't like to dwell, but man, I gotta say it, don't like my songs, but you still gotta play it
Don't like your road, just N.W.A., Dr. Dre it
Stop contemplatin' and stop complainin'
And recreate it, actually, don't recreate it, be creative
Reached the place where you still vibe in that shit when we replay it
Living a life of pain just to alleviate it
When you haven't used nothing but distractions to really take it
Yeah, maybe they'll change when they see we made it
We headin' onto new platforms and leavin' the basics
Uh, my creative process is making progress
Despite my background, I haven't gotten to playin' lacrosse yet
Don't you know we got a good thing goin'?
I've been watchin' all these shows while I could be showin'
I've been creeping up on the door, so dangerous
You looking at statistics, while I figure how I'm changin' them
I done learned so many things in my past life
Now I don't give a single shit about the rap life
That's nice, ain't it? That's nice to be given advice when I paint it
Have twice much the fame, and
I can't even comprehend that much in the future
Hatin' the teacher, but you loving the tutor
Enter the game, I'm a fuckin' intruder
Stealin' these flows, man, I'm stuck as a looter
Procrastinatin' 'cause my fucking computer
No willpower, I'm just stuck as a loser

Sittin' alone at 3 AM
Chillin' on a late night is the weekday's friend
Man, this shit is too wild, I "must behave, Ben"
That's what the teachers are preachin' to me, but even when
I'm on the top of this drop and they're rocking the world with confidence
Accomplishments topplin' everyone and you try stoppin' it?
-Obvious there's a problem, and solvin' it just ain't up to me
Luckily, I've been trained to test the system, don't you fuck with me
I hope you like my company, I hope you do appreciate it
I hope that one day, you'll see we made it
No, you cannot recreate it, all of this pain, I just alleviate it
I'm just trying to find the mindset, grinding to be the greatest
That is why I'm strivin', livin', tryin', I'm buyin'
I'm givin' dignity, cryin', I'm winnin', but feel like dyin'
I'm shining, I'm like a diamond, but I am dead on the inside
Guessin' now we'll rest with this, but set it on my big mind
And I'm in time
-Workin' all my life, get that in line
I'm tryna figure out, everyone get their pictures out
Nobody's gonna live without this shit on the incline
I'm on the incline, I'm on the incline
Stay in your lane, you got your place and I'm in mine
I'm on the incline, bitch, I'm on the incline
Nobody can really understand how my shit climb

Have I been livin' yet? Spendin' time on the internet
I'm wastin', they hatin' it, I should be makin' it, aimin' for goals but takin' this shit instead
I stay in bed, laughin' at stupid shit, ludicrous
Who is this ten-year-old pregnant with two new kids? Why am I doing this?
Why the fuck do I care? I don't, but I kinda do
I don't know what I try to do, but whatever it is, I say, "Bye", to you
Hey, me, I lied to you! Don't realize? Well it's time you do
You have no idea what I can do, when the skies are gray, you gotta find a blue
You gotta try to do, something to put you into a new positive mindset
Set headlines, go wreck lines, pass deadlines, leave lines dead
I guess that I digress, and I digest the way I'm blessed
Impressed after I'm pressed, you seek intent for what I said
But I'm just gonna move on, get your groove on for my new song
Do right, and you do wrong, got a big head, Jimmy Neutron
You try to hate, well, get in line, just delivered some quick rhymes
Some straight bars, we have came far, but we lookin' up on the incline

Water break
I got a lot to say
It's been eleven minutes so far
Actually, it hasn't, it's been shorter

How can I have a believable meaning
When all of you livin' in paradise, livin' in luxury, nobody seen it or  greet it?
But what if it's different, I mean, it's all seeming to be, and it's in inconceivable dreaming?
I know it's so unbelievable, being stuck in this rare unachievable feeling
They givin' me something, I ended up leaving, they givin' me nothing, I ended up grievin'
No positive side, ended up seeing what life could be like from a  different lead in
Thank God for a cover zone so I know when and where to cross it
All over the place, I'm surprised I haven't lost it

Yeah, ayy, and I'm feeling like I'm at the top, uh
Livin' to the max now
Yeah, that's how, and I'ma say it that loud
I'm steppin' up, I never back down, more focused on my background
And the music and how my rap sounds, speak up, cut the track down
Go till the end, I don't back out, stuck in the trap, figure that out
After, I'll do the math now, it's garbage, take the trash out
But I'm here to stay till I pass out, blackout

Okay, it's time to go fast, so sit back and relax, and just maybe you'll get it
About time, but maybe you're mad I said it, you gon' pay attention, cash or credit?
I have to let it go back a second, I have some lyrics in the past that I have to edit
Now we're back in the middle of the track , mix it up and if you talk, then, nah, forget it
We moved on, walked past the exit, want you to come back and pass a message
-Never pack bags and trash, you left it, kinda sucks that sometimes we have to end it
Money, never am glad I spent it, if I ever had told you I'm mad, I meant it
If you ever feel bad or sad, accept it, think back to the track and the rap that Ben did
Yeah, pretty obvious I'm killing it, if this isn't my time, then maybe you need a syllabus
I'm feelin' all the rhythm, you can tell that I am into this, voice is more powerful than a million instruments
Suddenly, lyrics go demon, like it's somebody else, people want me to grow because of you
But I'm never going to level my endeavors to be better than the people that never had trust in me
Yeah, uh

And I'm feeling like I'm at the top, yeah
Livin' to the max now, uh
Yeah, that's how, and I'ma say it that loud
I'm stepping up, I never back down, more focused on background
And the music and how my rap sounds

Speak up, and they're messing with the track now
People are tellin' me that I'm fallin' short, looking back at you when you're missing all the cash now
And I'm mad at the fact that I'm not in my right mind
Meant to be a half-decent rapper, but I keep on saying all the wrong words at the right time
Lookin' at yourself, you never know what you might find, lookin' at the sky in the middle of the nighttime
I find so much life, I wonder why I can't just find mine
Got so many confusing questions, so much knowledge, I can use some lessons
I'm emerging out with a new profession, I'ma do the best with my new perfection
And I'm doin' it, I'm moving onto this future shit
These hooligans are complete fools in that they just don't understand that I am through with it
Improvin' it, I'm improvin' it, I got my brain, and I'm usin' it
And I'ma make it out alive when I'm playin' and takin' and makin' this cash, that I'm tearing these tools to bits
You're clueless, ninety percent of y'all ignorant
Keeping your minds oh-so limited, get off your high horse, because now it is time to figure it out
Seeming so close, I can picture it now, success in my drink, and I'm sippin' it now
Envisioning deeper ambitions, and now, I'ma get to it, that is what living's about

Uh, God!
Uh
My voice is gone already, shit
Ayy, ayy, ayy

Think I've got a consensus, bein' lost in the trenches
Adolescent lessons expressin' God's job is to tempt us
Makin' it hard to stay alive, it's so easy to die
Makin' you hang your head low, but say, "Reach for the skies"
Life is a walkin' contradiction, I see through its lies
I'm just tryna tell the stories I've seen through its eyes
I feel I'm forcing and feeding of off reasons to cry
With all this fake deep bullshit, I'm too eager to try
Yeah, everybody sendin' blessings in need of reply
Tryna sell their own tears, for they bleedin', they dry
Fuck your demons inside, I'm in need of the, "Why?"
So I can summarize my life through my breathing and sigh
Like, oh well, I can say that I tried
Hopped into life and then I stayed for the ride
So many beautiful faces, but they vacant inside
And I'm just patiently waiting for the day I decide, damn
This reminds me of days when I drive in L.A
I'm screamin', "Hi" to the sky up with a smile on my face
Now I'm hidin' my face, I keep tryin' to trace
All of the steps that I had taken to findin' my place
Swept out to oceans so lonely, waves feel like an embrace
And now I'm lookin' at my mic like it's sent as a prophet
I used to be an atheist, but that turned me agnostic
Recently, I've been wondering if I've fuckin' lost it
See my friends from kindergarten go to rehab
That's the type of shit that makes you think back
To simpler times, blissfully ignorant minds
Before reality could ground us, we would live in the skies
And as a- and as a kid, I never thought I'd be bein' like this (Nah)
Man, as a kid, I never thought this would even exist
I felt elusive, intangible, just steam in the mist
And now I'm wakin' up feelin' I ain't even this shit
You only look at what you got once you see that it's lost
And life's too gradual for me to believe in my sauce
Don't understand rappers braggin', "I got that paper on me"
Man, I got kids in schools who doin' presentations on me
So what the fuck you really value tryin' to take that from me?
To me, I'll take that over Rollies and makin' some money
Rain or sunny, I'ma do this every day, I study
And write these lyrics till my brain is fuzzy, damn
Like Tyler, Creator tweets, I just capitalize
These Romans tally up my hits with the capital 'I's
This is a natural high
I see it comin' from afar, I'm still actin' surprised, but I ain't mastered the skies
I wrote this album so much passion, I actually cried
They say 'cause I was never trappin', my rap is a lie
They think 'cause I'm a awkward kid, I'm invalid
As DJ Khaled's son receivin' a platinum plaque for bein' alive
Throughout half of my album, it wasn't good enough
Shit, I mean it still isn't good enough
I'm like an active volcano, I know I could erupt
But I guess I am not full enough, damn
I swear, the higher you get, that's the lower you feel
Man, that's more shit you gotta do, or you won't get a deal
Man, that's more shit you gotta prove so they know that it's real
Thirty seconds of listenin', thinkin' you know how I feel
Yeah, said this a motherfucking thesis statement
Yeah, came a long way, I cannot be complacent
Every day I wake up stressed, I have to be the greatest
And if not, then that's a day I truly feel I've wasted
Most of the pressure on my shoulders is comin' from me
So when I die, I know I left us with something to leave
So when I wake up in the morning with something to see
Yeah, I got so much shit that I'm wantin' to be

Benny, Ben, Benjamin, Selena Gomez has said
If you ready, come get it then, everyone is jealous-
Many want to get friends with them just in case he is relevant
Got iPhone camera lenses to get the Instagram evidence
Yeah, I know I'm way too cocky
But I'm workin', I'm figurin' it all out
So when people say you can't, that makes you wanna get better
That's benefit of the doubt
I've been on the top of this, never droppin' the bottom
It's opposite from the positives, got them from talkin' often
And I'm locked in a pocket of all my thoughts, and they keep turnin' around
Always stoppin' my songs 'cause they keep burnin' the sound, I'm like-
Yeah, this is freedom of speech
Tryna' murder all the people who be keepin' the peace
Sacrifice your whole life 'cause you need a degree
Opportunity in front of you, you need to achieve, I'm like-
Nah, I'm just tryna find some clarity
Apparently, it all has to do with popularity
There will be obstacles, primarily, people blinded to
What is carefully being prepared to me
Sometimes you'll have hilarity, parody, and prosperity
I'm askin' Hillary Clinton to marry me, powerful at the very least

Giving you all of my money, but never see legacy every day that I'm meant to see
Everyone here is impaired, it is so scary and menacing, but I know enemy
'Cause I go- uh, walking away, hopping block and what's often the case
Shot in the face, gun locked and loaded, been off at the race, droppin' the bass
Off of the place, brought in a way predict what I will probably say
And at the end of the day, you still talking to me, so, obviously, let the audience say
So let me explain this to those who came in looking at the stages
Seeing a white kid thinking he's famous
When they don't understand that I take risks and I make hits, from basic playlist to the greatest
Entertaining the nation, be patient whilst waiting for me to break in

-Re-energize, got lyrics to memorize
Start an enterprise of better guys who cannot be successful and never try
That's my dream job, bein' lazy, just sittin'
With the TV on, they say that I'm bright like neon
But I ain't takin' responsibility, pay me for havin'
Limited ability with little humility
But whatever I'm doin', it seems to be killin' me
I'm unwillingly artistically fittin' into this history
Tryna show you why I'm better, but none of you believe me
Tryna win this gold and try hard, good game, gg
You beat me, and now you see me in 3D, but you can't feel me
Showin' up on your device, control/option/delete
Consider myself elite, measure myself in retweets
I be talkin' way more chill so you can reach me
Instead of pretendin' you understand what I am talkin' 'bout
I'm the exhibit you kinda scared for, like a haunted house
Tryna show you something instead of just sittin' on the couch
I'll be honest now, I rarely- end up walkin' out
Into reality, in normality actually happily
Found myself doin' nothing, and you don't laugh at me, why?
'Cause, ideally, you would do the same thing
Nothing 'cause for- a brain that is amazing
Not complainin', but the best part of life is not even livin' it
Love sleepin' and just usin' the internet
But my time is limited, and I better figure this
Before I'm slippin' this opportunity, out my fingertips
And let me just tell you what I have came to do
Tryna' show you I can rap as fast as I'm able to
Tryna' show you I can hop in here, like a kangaroo
And say some stupid metaphors and leave after I'm breakin' through
And if a major record label is looking at me
I'm a nice guy with bad teeth, got a nice eye for bad beats
I can rap fast, and rap slow
I may make mistakes but everyone, has, so
I'm like MJ back when he had the afro
Also, I'm not black, so.. maybe not
But before everyone gets angry, stop
I'm that person, then people naturally hate me, block
All the people who keep on going crazy off
'Cause I won't be making amazing songs in a mainstream, got
A lot of prominent features, I'm a confident speaker
With some dominant teachers
I deserve to be starter, but constantly on the bleachers
I'm awfully small-achiever when I'm up on the spot, and eager
They be fearin' this every time that they hearin' it
To know that my lyrics have the precision to buildin' a pyramid
So when you're nearin' this, please let me know
When I'm standin' here frozen, please let it go
Hear the metronome combined in the compilation
To unlock super-stardom and move all across the nation
But that is just a dream, and probably a combination
Of a big ego and false encouragement on the way in
But when I'm playin', just know it's all a big game
I was tryna blow up- bang! Have a big name
But when you think about it, it is all insane
What can be created from chemicals in this brain
But when you look at me, you lackin' respect
When I'm crackin' my neck so that I can rap to my chest
Has in a breath, some say that it's magic, I step
Until I'm on the same stage, and you have it again
But, but when you think about the hall-of-fame
You think about how people used to sit and call you names
And you check and wonder if it will be all the same
Step back into reality, it all remains, damn

Alright, I just spilled water on my computer right now
On my computer-'s breaking while I'm doing this thirty-thousands words shit
Hold on, uh
Goddamn it

My lyrics are not showing up on the screen, you knowin' just what I mean
This is off the top, I don't need to use no machines
Hold up, I know I can freestyle, but I can't do it forever
But I am very clever
Okay, okay, I'm gonna take a drink, if you're watching this, take a drink too
These are some shit' that you can drink to
But drink water unless you're of age
You know what I'm saying? Ayy

Okay, okay
Uh
Uh
Ayy

I feel like I'm way too different, ridiculous
And most of humanity's made of idiots
I barely even get myself, and you thinkin' you understand?
You think hiding behind a screen gives you the upper-hand?
Please... what I do is barely poetry
There's hope for me, I'm noticing people starting to notice me
But still consider me confident
Still consider me ready and giving out all my flawlessness
But honestly, all of this, is haunting me, probably
It is just my sense of myself wobbling, toppling
Into awfully small pieces, normally all bleedin'
It's tragic and not fleetin', it follows me all evening
It's calling my name constantly, makes it so hard to stay awake
I close my eyes and let it go, and it all fades away
Yeah, we're just tryna find that great escape
To get away from how we're living life day-to-day
Some people find it in a drink or in a cup
Or in some bling or in a drug, or in the things that give us love
But all I know is that it's tough
And all I know is that this stuff isn't enough; it's way too much

I'm Jong and Ill, like the dictator, man, what I gotta do to make the quick paper?
These kid-haters are like ten years old, but still claim to be big players
That shit will make me go, but I'm aiming high, and you aiming low
Got amazing rhymes and a crazy flow, and I may be , but I came to show
What I can do when I get on the mic, and I'm keeping it moving, you said I'm the hype
And I'm seeing it through in successes inside, I don't take it for granted with plans in this life
-Set on the wrong, forgetting the right, like, 2 AM in my head in the lights
Ahead of the best of 'em, lettin' the rest of 'em go off to bed in the night
-Getting it like I be livin' in first class, I know that you never will surpass
-Getting the worst task for this burnt trash whenever I work fast
Remember the memos they sendin' and sendin' again and again  and they never will end it
And say it is splendid, but never relented and every sentence I say is perfected
Take a deep breath, 'cause I need that
Most of y'all don't even care what I'm saying, you really just like how I speak fast
My bars are meta, I got meta bars with meta-eights and metaphors
You want better cores and better cars, but you don't know what I'm headin' towards
Say that I am the king of this shit, crazy rhymes, they ain't thinkin' of this
I'm ingin' and rappin', and makin' it happen and makin' you laugh when I'm bringin' this shit
Tryna find the other way, y'all just waiting for another day
'Cause what other fourteen-year-old had hit 100K?
I'm making the most of a crazier flow, so many ways it could go
I'm taking the throne and you chillin' and stayin' at home, I'm willing to make it my own
I'm bakin' my cake, and you know that I'm eating it, even if staying up late is the needed bit
Reason is, stayin' the same, I'm just fleein' it, leavin' my life while I'm seeing these seasons switch
Meaning, these people ain't feelin' rich, reach in the fire, I'm heatin' it
Pleasin' these liars, they've , they so now they're receiving it, agreeing to be a live without leading it
Flow's so dope, I think it's time that we take a break
We all make mistakes and play some hate, I got 808s here to save the day
'Cause I am on top of it, lost in my thoughts and I gotta be stoppin' it, rockin' it
You know my flow is so dominant, positive, confident, full of accomplishments, compliments
All of these offers is boring as fuck, though I am not a part of 'em
Start a new part to the charts and I gotta be sure this art is the star on the map when I'm starting it
Breaking it up, like cartilage, flow is so crazy, it's dope and you know it
I know that you hate to admit it, but really, this shit is the business, rhymes keep darkenin'
Under the radar, you don't know what's comin', I'm comin' right up, and your bitch started runnin'
I found to be part of a little of something called love, and I guess that's the art of it
I try to go slow, but it don't work
-Gettin' better, that don't hurt, and you think I'm dead, and you're sure
You're salty and not kosher, slave to the corporates and the owners
This is live and love, call it Shrek, like the ogre
Hah, bitch, I have had enough, and I am sure I ain't mad enough
Forgettin' the rest while I'm gettin' success, and I look at the numbers, I add 'em up
This chart is like a parabola, thank you a lot for havin' us
And so, every day, I take one step up, man, I am takin' the ladder up
-Hundred K- get the plaque, lookin' forward, not heading back
Remember what I had said is that we ain't givin' up, remember that
Hit me up when you done whining, I'll hit you up when I'm done rhyming
Listen up, 'cause I'm combining all my skills into one finding
We run rhymes, you know we do, we got the shit that we're going through
These lyrics go over you, you don't listen, so you don't know it's true
'Cause we in, and we've done it, thousands, now we a hundred
Shoutout to Didac and Momo and the others
Shit, I consider them brothers, shit, I consider you all are my family
Shoutout to those who will stand with me, even when all of the others abandon me
Yeah, drama, we move past that, now I look at you with the last laugh
Better trackback, now I rap fast, so many skills in my backpack
Started off so terribly, now all of these people compare to me
In the past, I never anticipated what there would be
And seeya', so long now off to the end of the song now
See ya' next at five-hundred and a million, at's on now

It's on now
Oh shit, I'm almost out of water
This is a hard- this a- real challenge
This like, physically difficult, ayy

When I walk up in the scene, I hear a orchestra
Now everybody telling me I don't perform enough
My math teacher told me that I'd never be shit
And now, I'm searched more then the quadratic formula
Ayy, I got the formula, I got the formula
You got the sauce, but God damn, I got the formula, ayy
People always asking Ben, "Why you record so much?"
I got to fry up all these rappers quick, like, order up
Formula, like I'm Mr. Krabs
I change and transform it up, you stuck in the past
Yeah, I wear Supreme goggles to my science lab
Uh, it hurts to write this song, 'cause I don't like to brag
And now I've tied myself up, like a Nike Mag'
People love to criticize me for the life I've had
They make it 'bout white and black, like I'm Michael Jack'
I make these haters look confused, like it's Dora asking where Swipper at, ayy
Uh, bitch, I'm supreme, 'cause I got it on me, now they copy that, like a walkie-talkie
And I'm feelin' like they really want to stop me, tryna fold my paper, like it's origami
Wanna justify the hate, they call me cocky, and I am, 'cause your girl call me, 'Papi'
Tryna take ti-t-uh.. paparazzi, I'm a fax machine up in a lot of copies
Ayy, still saying, "Who woulda thought?", like, who would of guessed it, huh?
Haven't lifted weights in two years, but somehow, I'm always flexing
If you really want to find the answer to your question, here is where you should look:
Want the secret to the sauce, motherfucker? Better go and find a cookbook

Ayy, they doubt a fucker with a dream
Looking to the stars for some money and a scheme, yeah
Looking at the cars, all the hundreds and the greens
Serpent's told you, "No," and it's like nothing's as it seems
God damn, I guess I really thought he was the man
I guess I really thought he had some fans, but that shit is all a sham
All that cash he stocked was from a scam
All the views he got was from some spam
I've been living like, "Man, ain't why he been doin' what he can?
Why ain't he just sticking to the plan?
How has he been living with no limits, getting millions by the minutes?"
I don't get it, I don't really understand, I've been living like
"Damn, he ain't getting money by the 'Gram
I'll do better if I study my exams
Do I really wanna stand next to all these average fucking sad duds?"
So I hate this motherfucker with a dream, 'cause he has one

Yeah
Hate a motherfucker with a dream, 'cause he has one
Ayy
Just because you gave up, doesn't mean I'm a backup
Uh, uh, uh
Feel all my good times get replaced by the bad ones
And so they hate a motherfucker with a dream, 'cause he

'Cause he's been living this passion, I'ma just sit and imagine
I've got a bitch on my lap and she listen to rap, and she really been digging my track, and I'm livin' for Snap
That shit invisible now, I'm unoriginal now
I'm making 'u'-minimum wage, this is literal AIDS, and I need to figure this out
How did I get to the stage? I wanna get up on stage, do this shit everyday
And I won't care 'bout whatever they say, let 'em all pester away
But I just can't shoot my shot, got a bad gun
So I hate this motherfucker with a dream 'cause he has one

By now, if you're still watching this shit
You are a boss and you deserves some applause for this shit
But we ain't over, we ain't done, though
Am I taking a break? Are you dumb, bro?
Well, we nearing 10K, but I still need 30K
While all you sit around, I would rather work than play
Lyrics go through your dome, through your vertebrae
Hit you back and forth till you end up at the pearly gates

That was actually a pretty good bar
I just wrote that like, right- a second ago before I recorded this
Ayy, ayy
You know, just to add some- fill stuff in, uh

Sometimes, I don't know what to think
Sometimes, I don't know what'll
Make it okay, make it okay
I'm snorin' all day for dreams, yeah, ayy

Uh, wake up pondering, damn, my mind is wandering
All these opportunities left squandered in my oxygen
All accomplishments left haunted in my lack of confidence
Often is the result of falling under consciousness
You'd make babies cry, I make crazy lives
You're just angry, 'cause you're livin' in a fading lie
And I've been feeling this energy, feeling that somebody's getting the penalty
Fearing that one day you'll end up ahead of me, feeling that this is the end of me
No, will I tell you? No, never
I think I'm so clever, but in the grand scheme of things, I know that I'm no better
But I don't ever
Want to go to show, just one mo' letter
I'm a- go-getter, I go get A's and get grades
And get As, then wake up, and get C's, but get paid
Uh... my life is so unusual
To most, it isn't suitable, to me, it's irrefutable
Can't see me in a cubicle, I'd rather watch my funeral
I'd rather go back to stab my own brains out back in utero
Damn... but you know that I'm capable
You know I'ma pounce at any chance that is available
Feeling so unique and I think it's not explainable
No one hears my lyrics, and says, "OMG, relatable!"
No, that's not what I'm here to give
Been waiting- years for this, you're about to experience
Something that I've spent time, money and thought on
Learned about all the times money had thought wrong
Kinda funny, it's long gone, but time is crummy and not long
I ain't lucky, I'm not calm, not by a long-shot
Out on the inside, see me on the outside
Always think I'm positive, and never see the downsides
It's 'bout time you know the truth, you couldn't be further from it
Get your head out your own ass, you couldn't be further up it

Okay
Okay, okay
We're like thirty minutes in, thirty minutes, but we got thirty-thousand, bro
Fuck

Yeah, I'm the key to the equation, bitch, you better beware
I'm like the 'e' that equals all of the emcees squared
I'm just me, performing in front of empty chairs
But y'all see, so all of y'all better get prepared
I got so much opportunity, I gotta make the most of it
Shoes made of the banana peels, I feel like I'm supposed to slip
Man, in this life, we all climbing unstable ladders
It's not about who goes faster, but it's 'bout the man who'll hold his grip
Damn, I got a crazy ass work ethic
Blocked out south east and west, leave in one direction
I finished my album, and people saying they lovin' it
Fuck with it, but I took it down and redid it to perfection
We all students of rap, but we don't learn lessons
Like a Eskimo's jacket, all them be forgettin'
Wanted to fuck a nun, started like really badly
And I didn't even have to ask for me to get her blessing- that's a horrible bar
Can't stand me 'cause I crossed them up, their ankles hurtin'
Yeah, uh... yeah, yeah, I'm an amazing person
I base my motivation on my favorite angels words
About how I'ma make it, gettin' famous, man, that thing's for certain

You keep your standards low, man, I keep my standards high
Wanna' get on any action, like the Brazzers camera guy
Can't deny- I'm fucking insane, sometimes I fantasize
How it would be like to be normal, but I just randomize
And analyze my situations, leaving people paralyzed
And take a step out of bed, meanwhile I'm at my paradise
America is very nice, but I'd like to see the world
But I'd like to get out in to the open and meet my girl

In a Mercedes Benz with his lady friends
Crazy Ben is just chilling with them women, you know they be tense
They'd be tense or more, they'd be tense or more
I like to talk to all these people, 'cause they marvel at my metaphors
It's free speech, I can say what I want
But these listenin' are trying to make me pay for my talk
They don't like what I'm doing, they don't appreciate the banter
I get it, you're jealous, but listen, 'cause I'm the answer, uh
Motherfucker, I'ma live for the right time
Fuck that, I'ma live for the moment
Sitting here in the middle of the night time
My mind puzzled with the thoughts that be flowing
Damn, I've been living in a headache
Bitches never listening, they saying that they ready
But I can never believe them
Got these goals and they can never achieve 'em
How can your dreams come true if you ain't willing to dream 'em?
Damn, that's a lot of shit to think about
Suddenly, company starts to come to me, wondering
What I'm doing, next I realize, that shit, I gotta figure out
Made some beats, I gotta hit 'em out, heh
Got these dreams that I'm living out
In my mind's eye, giving out lots of songs with responses
That I never pictured, wow, damn, damn
This beat's way too holy to rap over
Mental block, my mind's capacities, that's lower
Your raps slower, they lack closure, they lack substance
Like a printer without toner, y'all filling pages that have nothing
Ooh, but I have got something to tell you
I ain't got some money or bullshit to sell you
Speaking from late nights, I'm thinking of Drake's life
Watching these interviews, thinking, one day, I might
Be on that stage right beside all these players
Shit's up to me, I won't hide it in prayers
I'll prove it in music I use to influence
I do this way harder than people assuming
Resuming my writing, viewing this lighting
That puts me to be in the view of the hiding
I do what they're liking, but that makes 'em hate me
No matter what I do, they just mistake the
Reason I'm flowing, the reason I start up
Not just for the fame, and the money, the star bucks
And- damn, I ain't talking about the coffee place
Most to these rappers only write this shit using copy/paste
I'd have made a lot of songs that go to waste, uh
I just need a home run, I already loaded base-s
I have got so many cases
Been visiting, living in so many places
Experiences that I made me to Emmy
Ben, B-E-N, please, I hope you let me
Be me, I ain't greedy or needy
Believe me, I just want to be on your TV
Get on my level, 'cause I need a new staircase
Damn, yeah, I've been looking at their face
And, one day, I'll be there
I know what I'm doing, I'm already prepared

I've been waiting like thirty-thousand years
Tryna make the world listen, so make sure that you can hear
I'm trying to take a passion out of turning my career
I'm concerned without my fear, but I earned it, and I'm here
Now I earned it, and I'm here to stay
I'm coming in, you're trying to clear the way, another chance, another fucking year to play
Not even seventeen, eighteen, I'm so near to fame
Not really, look at all the shit, I just hear this day
I don't know- I look at the future nostalgically
I'd cure every disease, and y'all still wouldn't be proud of me
Undoubtably know how to be what I am about to be
To say that money talks, and that shit seems so damn loud to me

Recently, I have been feeling alienated
My songs out of this world, people claim that aliens made 'em
But, baby, I'm crazy, don't hate me- don't hate me 'cause I'm different
Hate me because you hate me, then maybe we can live with it

That people say that this is the biggest thing to hop on the screen
All will scream, overreacting, like it's a drama scene
Y'all are mean, and since the best quality is honesty
Promise me that it's the reality, where's Keanu Reeves?
Trapped in a Matrix, it's how I felt sometimes back in the ages
When I would rap on a stages, and now I laugh at those days, and
I'm moving on, grooving while you lose the song
Move along, nothing to see here except some stupid pawns
Who could bomb those whole place up with one great lung?
One great tongue, I am that one great one on vacation
I vacate to a location
Far away from where people just may run
A light to go to where there is no one, no one, no fun
Oh, son, I'm tryna be me, and so young
I can murder this beat with no gun, go run
I've too many problems to handle, here, hold one
I just hop onto the rap boat, but that ship has now sunks
And now, punks can make loud junk, Uptown Funk
Was a great song, catchy at first
But that radio station playing it, and making it just get to the worst, my head's gonna burst
If I hear it again, and I'm sure
I'll throw my speakers on the ground, denting the earth
And now, I'm ending this verse, and I mean it
Now the ink of this pen just keeps on bleeding, yeah

Good rappers never get to see the light of day
But when you selling sex and a gimmick, they'll sign you right away
I'll obey.. nah, whatever, man, what is this?
I'm rapping so fast to the max, and I'm playing my tracks so that people will know I mean business
Nobody witness anything better than when I am showing you did this
Know I'm suspicious, because I'll be flowing and growing like, "Oh, this kid is big"
Know how I live it, go on a mission, y'all better listen
Till I'm ahead of this shit by all of the inches, 'eah
And when I'm, uh.. I'm telling y'all that I got a story
God ignores me, stop the glory, cop is for me in auditory
Not visually, typically, the original me
So unforgivable, so inexplicable, obvious the pinnacle digitally
Damn, that was fast, felt so gentle I unpacked
And I'm just tryna prove to you the things that I can move on the track
And I'm trying to get a record deal, never ever felt so real
Whenever we're the guests to feel, whenever f-this gets to feel
So different, and I'm loving, time to change, and discover it
Time to make a difference, and I'm living it, so I'm up for it
I always talk to that mother, kids, the mother kids couldn't understand me
One path, making a knot, ain't gonna stop for plan B

I wrote that one a long time ago
That was the first time that I looked- that I- I looked at those again
But you know, I still- I'm not that rusty, not that rusty
I- actually... classic!

We just living in the solar system
One big world here to hold the wisdom
One big jail to control the victims
We're all here tryna find a soul in rhythm
A voice in writing and a choice deciding
Whether or not to follow what the boys are likin'
What the girls are doing, what we gotta be exposed to
Think about who you are, and it's so true
Think about the people who you think have really known you
Do they really know you? Do you even know you?
Damn, that shit is like a Jaden Smith tweet
Sometimes you gotta think 'bout how crazy shit be
And lately it seems to make the extremes
So prominent and dominant in making big dreams
I'm seeing aliens scream
When I go to sleep, man, my brain needs fixing
But I'm just tryna make it in life
Fuck you to people who be saying it like
I ain't making it right? Take a vacation and hike
I'm- chilled out, bitches, getting famous despite the fact
That I'm young and little bit nerdy
And I know a lot of people would consider me early
I'm just a little kid working tryna configure my searches
Tryna deliver my purpose, and take a shit on my burdens
I'm just me, no, I ain't a victim or hurting
I just see all the people living and burning
So be free, time to be a little bit nervous
It don't matter if you're scared, 'cause this shit is disturbing
And I get it, I don't wanna ever forget it
Guessin' I'm headed towards the ending, and I know it is splendid
So I'll see ya'- round, underachievers
Hop on my wagon, 'cause we dragging late, we gotta be leaving, man

So basically, I do this for fun, they ain't making me
I'm tryna have a blast, 'cause we growing so fast, we be getting my career from A to Z
And, basically, I'm great you see, I made my life at the age of three
But- what am I meant to do when my own fanbase are hating me?

I've seen people misusing their fans, like crooks
Manipulating their audience to catch that hook
They'll believe anything that you'll tell them, look-
You can- feed them shit so you can sell your book, haha
But no shots fired, though
Nothing wrong with a little bit of lying though
I mean... look at Fox News
That's the whole premise of their entire show
But no political shit, I always do just enough, I'm a minimalist
Makin the most of my minimums, winnin' 'em, got a couple of synonyms to help you listen to original bits
I- got a lot of digital prints, man, your own homedog is a literal bitch
But I'm filling the syllables, it's a little predictable, 'cause I've written this shit for all of the cynical kids
I got time! Maybe a little too much of it
But you know that I'm tryna move up a bit
People look at me and say my potential has
Got a big max, and you know that I'm lovin' it
So fire- can't handle me with oven mitts
Underground, blessed if you discovered it
Flow is so unique, I got so much to do
Not like any other kid

Ayy, yo', what you say, though?
Yeah, it's Quadeca comin' straight out the Bay, though'
Yeah, when I walk out in the town, I gotta stay low
You know I'm comin' to them checks like Usain Bolt

Wait so, inhale the fumes while I paint this picture:
Me, I'm sitting in my room and I'm anxious
Tryna make my moves while they huge and they famous
I knew this shit I couldn't do, I was jaded
Now, somehow, I'm next up, yeah, I'm blessed up
Now I wake up and I'm fly, I don't dress up
Now I'm fly and my opponents better catch up
I get my checks, uh, all y'all need to step up
I-I-I-I-I-I- remember trying to practice my cadence
In tracks I was makin', I had to be patient
Everybody said that shit was trash, and they were right
But I turn that shit and made it right, shit is day and night
Now I gotta take a flight to Vegas, might not stay the night
Everybody see me eattin', now they want to take a bite
So I'm like, "Okay... no way"
Yeah, when it comes to this shit, man, I don't play
I'm like Houdini in my Ghost, yeah, you can't see me, I'm gone
Ball so hard, I gotta wear my Yeezys to prom
YouTube bitches asking me to retweet they song
I'm the reason people got Spotify Premium on
Ayy, yo', what you say, though?
Yeah, it's Quadeca comin' straight out the Bay, though'
Yeah, when I walk out in the town, I gotta stay low
You know I'm runnin' to them checks like Usain Bolt
So I'm like okay, not no way, when it comes to that shit, man, I don't play
If you ask me how I got it I  say, I got the drive, yeah, really get out of the roadway, uh

Damn
Some of these are
Too slow and also too fast
Whatever

I'm out of order, three hoes like I'm Santa Claus
Pull up on your bitch, Bape hoodie with a camouflage
Hey now, yo, what's the play now?
I'm tryna slide, I ain't talkin' 'bout a playground
Yeah, I remember all them days I would stay down
20K's chillin' in in my PayPal
So what the fuck you wanna say- you wanna say now? Nothing
Best in my town and that's no discussion
Humble beginnings, ain't humble, we winnin'
If I wanna bag, that's my humble decision
Everything I do is going off
So if I wanna freestyle, then you better know the cost, ayy

I think she blocked me
Damn
There's no more water, I'm literally about to die

I think she blocked me on the Instagram
I need to know, what did I do? I guess I missed your plan
Me, I'm just searchin' for that truest shit, where is it, man?
I'll never know, just wanted you to help me understand
I need some closure because, truthfully, I give a damn, I give a damn
Plenty of fish in the sea, but see, I ain't no fisherman
See, I'm a middleman, a businessman, and this means business, man
Diggin' in the sand, lookin for a reason, I'm not kiddin', man

How am I gonna let all of this get to me? Been a few months since you texted me
Shit, I'll just tell myself I'm a celebrity, ain't no way that this can get to me
And in the grand scheme of things, it doesn't matter, but right now, it's feeling like everything
The more I talk about it, it just gets sadder, 'member thinkin' about a wedding ring
But now I'm thinkin' 'bout so many things, what did I do to deserve it?
This shit the most petty of petty things, I'll stick with how nobody's perfect
Like all of my life, I'll forget about it and all of the things that I'd said about it
But why the fuck did I get blocked? I just cannot wrap my head around it

I just can't wrap my head around it
Now I'm just getting bored, I'm just fuckin' up all the flows
Just for the fun of it
If you're still watchin' this shit, uh, comment, uh...
Comment, "Arrowhead water", in the comments
And let me know what-what would you rate this out of ten
Give me a rating, that way know that you're real- that you're real one
You know what I'm saying? Alright, here we go

Spectacular speculations- havin' some reservations
Imaginin' all the statements- travellin' through these places
Back in, then buy some passionate trashin' of reputations
They actually don't have facts, and reality left them baseless
I wish that we left 'em nameless- 'sociate 'em with faces
Make judgments from expectations and watch as their heads are shaking
-People want me to crumble and turn to some medication
To fuck up my motivation and focus on education

But I'm petty, petty, pett,y petty, that's all they really ever tell me
So many times that you convince me of shit, that I swear you could've won an Emmy
I got a phone in my hand, like a note for the 'Gram, and I'm thinkin' about holdin' your hand, but you don't understand
I think that love is either gold or a scam, and you never really know till the end, like, how all this began

I've been comin' at this as a man, trying to figure out where I fit into the plan
How does all the drama surround me? I hear 'em followin' loudly, and I don't wanna hear about this shit again
I guess that's the way it goes when they stalk me and do anything to try and stop me
I did nothing wrong, but that's how it goes when a basic bitch try to block me, uh

Livin' life, but you stay the same how you expect
Yourself to go take the fan making name
But you don't take the pen you wanna be
Unique but not make it change like what
How you expect to go through this think
About the girls man why you wanna do is
So stupid and useless if you never lose
It with yourself a little for the
Movement when I write the St. the ode to
Joy' this the oldest success don't know
If there is a God but I know that I'm
Blessed and I'm hoping to know and I'm
Open to yes I'll do whatever I can to go
To the best that will go to the right
And go to the left no doubt imma show up
At night instead of going to bed when I
Know that I'm right I'm exploding my
Chest I keep on loading the time and it
Goes over my head I think no why do I
Even try these things I need shiny
Things like diamond rings and flying
Rings and preci bling that is what
Drives these strains I'm so I'm so
Lively and lazy at the same time saying
Something sane and crazy in the same
Rhyme never go to practice who don't
Faze me 'til it's game time
Learning his life will amaze me how I
Made my define a minute
When a wetland is favorite the mik
Children they get so pissed with me I'm
Either villain now they no kidding and
No I'm not quitting I know I'm just
Sitting sitting with a dream and maybe
Maybe just sit in this city where the
Dream could take me but I know it can't
I know it tastes look I'm angry why I
Just the B of the A-team at the
Feet of the mainstream man I dream for
This daydream and I believe that I'm
Making it cease for the taking it's me
In a train and I see that I'm breaking
My knees aren't place and I keep on
Thinking that I'm being amazing but I'm
Improving I know it's just a slow climb
Pushing myself yeah I'll be there in no
Time so I'm moving I'm moving till I get
There get where I just don't want to get
Left there

I don't remember I don't even
Know what that's from but that was
Written in there it's been a lot of late
Nights okay

I don't give a fuck about anything
Skinny white child on the track, but I’m threatening, they don’t wanna let ‘em in
They told me if I take it, I’ll feel better, like it’s medicine
But I ain’t settling, they tryna’ rush me, like adrenaline

And labels don't reply so I
Can't get it deal I mean is it footage
Did someone get me a Benadryl
I got a hell of skill man they worried
That I never will a success in skills
Men are done seven mill I think about
Food by the chair I'll be going over
Putting the determinant shame in the
Hypocrites women nobody buzzer okay that
One's for you huh
I'm wanna Christmas as a Christmas gift
Middle child no I'm anything but in the
Middle bitch man I don't give a shit I'm
Behaving saw ridiculous I'm the type to
Add my fucking seat Sephora syllabus ah
Existential crisis every day I think I
Don't exist you check a little I'm a
Frying pan I'm a dying man I wake up
Every damn I make a fucking diagram and
Find a plan to be the highest man in the
Sky Atlanta rap so fucking hard I think
I'm entering my diaphragm Iron Man think
I'm Iron Man because we couldn't fire
Emojis of my entire gram I'm a fireman
Second grade teacher got me singing in
The choir man and like a word a my notes
Thought I would acquired its carbon soot
A bunch of random shit in climate man
That's so much I do not give a fuck
Let's go to Ireland under grand on those
Rubber bands hold your fucking bands
Listening to the cash register like your
Fucking Jam don't understand like a
Republican with a gun in his hand saying
That Trump is a man to come to the plan
Living in Wonderland this it is a
Fucking scam making America each other
That's dumb again, huh?

They told me I
Needed to do a switch up my friends told
Me I needed to get my hips up it ain't
That simple I'm not someone that white
Teenagers wanna be like I can't say it
Sir and a mimin hard to pick up pick up
I'm the transnational British person
Dimension c-137 is my biggest version
I'll be disturbing his music it isn't
Listed as
Urban air quotes next to my name of red
Caps that's bird and I'm a fucking
Burden to every fucking person I'm this
Earthman I'm determined either trying to
Get a book and sorted out pins and
Needles like an amateur surgeon that
Makes no sense
All these listeners are so dense the
Song is conversational so why you still
Talking to me just went out so why are
You talking to me I'm trying to give you
Free money not fondue your feet
I'm tryna to make a deal not call the
Police I have free publicity they don't
Want to be seen I guess they don't wanna
Be seen fuck these monopoly seats you're
They collapse rabble's 150 plays I hit
Him up about it away 60 days now I'm
Bigger than these rappers I'm asking I
Hit him up again and then I never get a
Response damn what the fuck is happening
Damn, I said-

F-fuck a lawsuit, fuck a lawsuit
What'd it cost me? What'd it cost you?
Gotta stop you, y'all are not cute
Huh, no need to argue, 'cause I do not lose, ayy, uh

A who is your mama I need to
Know who taught you I need to how you
Believe it I'm sure that nobody believes
You I make it I'm making music as soon
As the thumbing of money you're trying
To review you hadn't claimed a reverse
On my album are you gonna claim these
Two 'cause I am independent you a little
Jealous and you skeptical if I'm pretty
Selling you assuming that I can legit
Offender I'm a senior I hear what a
Prison sentence you copyright abusive
Pricks trying to profit off my music
Shit his little do you know that I'm not
Afraid of you until I refuse to quit you
Stupid bitch
For real my chick on mass appeal hey
Every Sunday the top is an anthem you
Don't really have to kneel damn restart
You don't have to steal don't like we
Hide the deal damn if I say the teller I
Feel is reeling I've had no drill damn
But Kali we had a deal me to shit ain't
Daffodils damn when the dough comes down
My door can deploy a happy meal hey if
It doesn't have to go never try late
Riser do come and I'm gonna have to
Chill yet it's a new way yelling - Laney
You say you gonna start tomorrow or
Tomorrow - day I get I get all these
Bags stuff a minute suitcase with these
To be spin up clothes like you was Boonk Gang

I accidentally quit out all these lyrics
So I was just- trying to piece it together like a puzzle
You know what I'm saying?
Ayy, let's go random shit, ayy

I take no credit for anything that I do
But I live life with a positive attitude
That's why I've seen pissed, but I'm
Never getting mad at you that's the
Reason that people mirror my attributes
What I contribute to the world is some
Places shit nobody else's world did and
I'm just trying to spread some pieces
Love my man it's really hard 'cause you
Need some love I've been waiting, 'cause
This is defense time for me to be laying
Out of business and I'm breathing in the
Air but it all tastes
When all of this time is wasted really
Ain't wasted

This is trash, I don't know when I wrote this
I think I wrote this in like 2013, this is how far back I-
This is how far back we are, I'm not even gonna rap this
Let's do something else- oh, okay, let's do this

It's bumpin', this beat is just so disgustin'
You leavin' me in the lust of my meet-and-greet for my lovin'
I'm enchanted, damn, this beat is just full of somethin'
That's makin' me want to get up, and breath in all the percussion
Man, I'm dancing, dancing, man, I'm feelin' the rhythm
Droppin' my head, fancy snares, and when it hits 'em
It really gets in my bloodstream, life just makes sense to me
Bass and a good- groove is really a great recipe
Can't- mess with me, no one, I'm feeling too in the moment
Feelin' new when I go in, and feelin' blue when it's over
And I'm- noddin' yes, and then I am proddin' next
And I'm tryna' to mentally send God a text
Like, "Hey, what's up, God? I don't know if you're real
But, listen to how this bumps, you supposedly feel like a god
But, y-you get what I'm sayin'?"
And God damn, I just can't really express when I'm playing

Really, this is bumpin' to me
You ain't feelin' it, so then you just get up and you leave
But this is- something to me, so don't come runnin' to me
I said we comin' in this shit like we be fuckin' the dream, shit
No, never mind, probably not
But I constantly got- energy that's lost in my thoughts
And I'm not gonna stop, and yes, it's maybe costing a lot
But lookin' at the end result, man, we've accomplished a lot
And no, I'm not gonna regret a thing after this
I'm still trying to master this, 'cause now I'm known as that weird-ass rappin' kid
The fact of it is that it is really- just a giant hobby
Something for me to be original, not a lyin' copy
Trying to make some shit where you can really get your head nodding
Verses so fire that, when I'm done, you're left sobbing
But that won't happen, like I said, we just a work-in-progress
Some of my shit means shit and other words are nonsense
But now we easin' up, we got a beat that's bumpin'
See me stuntin' while I'm flowin', we adjusting, see me bluffin'
Everyday, man, see me bluffin', that is what I do
Listen to some good shit, tryna' make a substitute
I got so much stuff to do, and I am just a youngin' too
Who just hopped on the scene? Everybody wonders who
But all I know is- that we find a safety in rhythm
And that is the reason- that I am making a shipment
I said it's bumpin', yeah

Nearing- we're nearing an hour if you're still
Watching the shit I love you I actually
Like love you long time
Okay

I said, I'm married to the game, but I only just met her
Hopin' that my shit get better, but I'm just gonna'
Move with it, ride with it
It's my life, the only burden is the time limit
Fuck it, I'm livin', I said, "Fuck it, I'm livin'"
People are getting mad, just because, yeah, I'm winnin'
Just because, yeah, I'm winnin', they're stuck-up, and I get it
Just because your life sucks, stop corrupting mine with it
I-I messed up the punchline, it's actually really good
Just because your life sucks, stop corrupting mine with it, ayy
Ayy, ayy, uh
Just because your life sucks, stop corrupting mine with it, eh

Yeah, time to move on, grindin' out all my new songs
My only motivation is people I need to prove wrong
Yeah
Said, my only motivation is- yeah
And, how am I meant to keep my workflow up?
If a girl shows up, all my world blows up
I'm just sittin' and waitin', instead of becomin' the greatest
Tryna' find a brand new motherfuckin' deal
All you bitches fake, all my numbers real
All my shit is punchin' in my stomach, like a meal
Am I married to the game if I can't afford a ring?
It's all very much the same if I can't afford to sing
Man, it's scary for a king, even-, I said, it's scary for a king, even
They call me odd, but I bring even
I bring reason to believe in it, even it up for free, and
The meaning is really scenin', no line can be wrong between em'
I don't show seasons, I am me, no matter what
And that can grow pleasin', I'm barely close to anybody
I don't know people, man, I don't know people who so equal
I don't know nobody who doesn't own evil
Man, that it just a truth and a lie
A truth and a lie, somethin' like the blue in the sky
Or a suit and a tie, I'm new to the life, I'm new in my mind
New to the time, man, I'm like the proof in disguise
And I'm- lookin' at all of this shit
Oh, you should know I'm not fallin' for this
You get discouraged for one minute
The next minute, you be callin' it quits
And I'll probably get rich If I focus enough
You close-minded, let's open it up
And all of these people assumin' 'bout what I be doin'
But they do not know what is up
And I just wish- that they would fucking go away
And I won't obey, no I will- never ever show the way
And I will try to mask it up with other jokes on fucking jokes
Always playin' G', but now I'm movin' onto other notes, yeah

My voice is fucking hurting
It's hurting, a lot, I'm not- I haven't had vocal training
So I don't know how to- d do this for a long period of time
Without causing damage to my vocal cords, but who gives a fuck?
Man, I just live it up
I'm gonna go a little bit quieter now
Uh-huh
Yeah

All of these people keep on changin'
All of these times and different phases
All of these lights, I know the stages
All of these sights is so amazing
Yeah, I've seen at least a million faces
A million times, a million places
But when it's all said and done
I look and I wonder why, uh

Everyone knows that it's so amazing, all the support is my motivation
Compared to the big people at the Capital, my name is spelt in lower cases
People loved me before I made it, people liked it before they watched it
I'm on a way too much more than I have, and I'm glad, because now, I will never stop it
Man on a mission, and I got a vision of talking a lot of wisdom, and I gotta listen
Gotta follow and be the leader, and tomorrow, I'll be the teacher when they need the feature
Got flow, and it's so damn crazy, people consider me so amazing
I'm holding control and then folding them verses, I'm hurt because I'm on loaded bases
Advancing, I know the basics, already know them, they're overrated than me
Meanwhile, I am not rated at all, so we hoping, because now I am open for game
I'm charged up, I ain't Drake, but I'm on the worst behavior
So many people they know the players, don't know the game and don't know the makers
Don't know the fakers, but who cares? I'm not here to cater, I'm here to improve and show that I'm greater
I'm here to go move and just go on the layers, and bitch, I am going so later
I got time, my own lyrics, I got mine
And I'm on time for the wrong lines, and I'm not crying, so let's start grinding, let's go

I've been living life all on my own
All on my own, people keep calling my phone
Wanting to know when I'll be the star of the show
But I'm all my own, I'm all on my own
And I don't want to talk about it, stop to doubt it
'Cause the world is awfully crowded, but-
The ghost of me is haunting the throne
So I'll make it there all on my own

My intermission is mixing with intermissions
And following intuition conflicting with my decision
And it is more than just business, 'cause this is for self-approval
And it is to make it look like I'm living for something useful
And it's sad, but you know it's true for most of you
Appearances distracting from the goals that you should go pursue, the growing movement
Sue a new type of thing that you can gain from
To push away the past and the places that you came from
Day one for me was like six months ago-

Oh, holy shit!
I actually reached the end of the beat
But I still have, like
Ten-thousand more words
Hold on, I gotta pause this
Hold on, three, it's still one-take!

-Past and the places that you came from
Day one for me was like six months ago
Look at where we been, but imagine where one can go
Its not fun to know that we just livin' to die
We now know how much money you can give for a lie
Give for a look, but how much can you give for an eye?
What's the point of feeling shit if you just living to cry?
So, get your ass up, 'cause it's time to make it happen
Always been shitty at rappin', but I practice for the passion, man

Yeah, I've been living life all on my own, bitch
I ain't the star of the show, bitch

I know like four people who truly respect the grind
And it's usually left to climb in a newly perfected rhyme
And if time is money then free time ain't really free
And sometimes I get pissed 'cause my own lyrics ain't really me
They stemming from a branch of a wishlist on my Christmas tree
I want to be what's taunting me, but sorry, I'm a mini-me
In the face of my full potential, that is the biggest me
Bigger than you, bigger than anybody in history
The challenge is a challenge, the fact that you got to maximize
To satisfy a lavish life and have a crazy magic time
And luckily I'm so damn young, 'cause, man, I have the time
To learn from my mistakes and grow into a mastermind
I'm trying to master my craft, and the problem is that I've got
Several different things to potentially make my job
I want to make the MLS, and also have a mili' subs
And also get a mili' plays, and maybe make a mili' bucks
A million- shit, all we ever want is more, really
And once I get three million, I want four milli'
It's so silly, it's so tricky, this whole cycle
We can never be happy, but that is so vital

Uh
Those are actually some good lyrics
Uh

Rebirth, feet hit the earth
My knees hurt
They're weaker than
Previously, her breathing seems to be burnt like
Free CDs were before we
Could be searched
I'm like please, just please work
Like a lenient slave owner
That's edgy like gravestones
Oh, you get me
I saved dough for a Bentley
Two percent there already
I may go for a Chevy
'Cause who cares about flexin' if you ain't holding it heavy
Uh, I've been trying’ to prove to all of the people I knew
Who didn't like what I do
Disgusted like, "Ew"
Yeah, this shit goes outta you
Plans have now all become true
Seeing them through
Man, that's the reason I do
All of the things that I do
It's not for a crew
Not for a god or a demon
I've really been needing a clue
Filling these shoes
Reading these pieces and news
Damn this shit really is screwed
It gives me the blues
Whenever i'm shielding my eyes from the darkness and don't get a view, uh
But if ignorance is really bliss
Then why this ignorance be killin’ kids
And why's this ignorance is truly vicious it's not giving shit and ends up innocent
That shit really is ridiculous it's magnificently
Fucked up
But nobody wants to tough it up
I've even seen it goin down, it's comin’ up-

'Kay to the Vatican having
Them good times and bad times new Romans
Do that again when I was when I was so
Young too young to really know fun but
So but I guess that's what happens when
You grow up dry your eyes and wipe your
Nose up just keep drinking till you
Throw up tell me one judge but we all
Just want to be loved and somehow get
Validated by those we hate such a
Twisted system that we've been given to
Harmful a I've been really thinking and

Piece of what we can afford

Now with his praise man I think I gotta
Find out all these questions man I
Really wanna hide down oh I want to drop
Out maybe learn a lot about my strip
Before our way to see it die out damn I
Just want to go along I'm holding strong

Old enough from throwing up bars so sick

Uh, yeah, ayy

I'm addicted to the screen and the
Validations of people who are 13 in
Another nation I've been looking for
Seven sent a message or a comment on a
Video it seems to be wasted like
Internet track meets they II traced it
Look at this shit I just recently made
It that's how it goes when I'm beaten
And breathing achieving and keep on
Succeed in there Haiti y'all lousy they
Can't breathe all that smoke bro you
Doubt me but just see where I'll go so
Allow me to break free from my own dome
To get out there be me believe in my own
Zone things become intense of the heat
Of the ozone is surrounding me I need to
Go home so can I pretty please just be
All alone nobody to retweet to leave on
My home phone I ain't gonna I'm gonna
Hop in a drug shit when they all come
And they love it ain't gonna happen
Allow sure when I know I ain't about it
Yeah they're gonna take us away now they
Got something to say now you can order
This shit on a take-out
All of these this
Is a fake now

Okay so all my clothes is Japanese, I wear it casually
And I'm a killer on the mic, might cause a couple casualties
And all I'm needin' is a beat to make your fuckin' salary
Man, I said, "Fuck the peanut gallery, I got a fuckin' allergy"
Trappin' down my PayPal, make it Friends and Family
Now I'm so hot, I need some oven mitts, ain't safe to handle me
Now I made my checks from Spotify, they pay me handsomely
I got the mic up to my brain to help maintain my sanity, okay
Everybody 'round me they been wasting my time, ayy
Pull up to the functions, see they face when I rhyme, ayy
Everyone's a critic on my case all the time
Do it by myself, I don't need a way to get signed

Bitch, I'm clouted up, yeah, I'm clouted up, ayy
Get my numbers up, gotta add 'em up, ayy
Until I get it, I ain't never packin' up, no
And they all comin' for my blood like Dracula, ayy

Okay, I'm backin' this, not maskin' shit, now everybody wanna go packin' shit
I don't give a fuck, you know I'm abstinent, I'ma fuck the whole game up on accident
Wait a minute, shit, I'm too passionate, said I save it for my , no cappin' it
Remember when they used to all laugh at this, and they hit me up like, "What the fuck's happenin'?"
Yeah, I had to sacrifice a lot of sleep
Because a lot of people want a lot from me
(Ayy) Yeah, standing in the way of who I wanna be
Now random strangers recognize me when I cross the street

So many memories, do you remember these
Moments way back in the time?
Trapped in the back of my mind
I am so happy to grind, I am so happy to find
So much experience now that I'm passing the lines
Now that I'm grasping the signs
I have been laughing a lot, got nothing to hide
No, I've got nothing to hide
Bitch, I am stuck, left behind
I need a drive, yeah, I need something to ride
Fill my own bank account, shit that I'm making now
Put it all off to the side
Feeling the vibe, got this new sorrowful happiness
That I just can't seem to guide
Feeling alive, yes, I am breathing the air
And I'm feeling so careless, but I can't
Let go
Every morning I wake up, I'm wanting to drop out
But I can't stop now
You know I put too much work into this shit just to pop out
So I walk down five different paths every day
Just need the one, it's only begun
No, I'm not going away
No, I'm not going to say
That this shit is going badly at all
I'm glad that I fall
I love the ref, but I ain't mad at the call
I'm mad at the call
Yeah, I'm having it all, I'm traveling far
I'm practicing hard
Never going back to the start, never going back to the start

You should know that I'm putting my work on the table
No, I am so able, I'm lining these cables
I got the horsepower, but tied to the stables, get by with no label
I do the mixing and mastering
Writing and rapping and making it happen
I'm eating my cake, and I'm having it
Real emotion, I'm tapping in, passionate
And I am working my hardest
It's already started, yes, I am being an artist
I'm feeling the largest
I'm feeling the largest


Oh!
Is that the final beat change up?
Alright, we were on that last beat for like an hour
For lit- literally an hour... um..
But you know what? Gotta hop on this classic beat, ayy
Uh
Yeah
Had to change it for all you that have been watching till
Till the end, you know?
You didn't think that beat was ever gonna change, but it did, though
Uh
Yeah
Ayy

Recently, I've been feeling my lyrics missing meaning
I'm trying to whitewash how much they stink like I'm Listerine-ing
Damn, I'm feeling like I've missed the key
And so I guess that DJ Khaled is always skipping me
But, yeah, you know I'm trying to do what I can
But these ignorant idiots just can't understand
Yeah, you know I'm trying to do what I can
But these ignorant idiots just can't understand
I got new crews and the new friends, got new views in a new lens
I'm the new dude, I'm the new Ben, got my YouTube with the new trends
But the way I'm growing is so unorthodox
How could I be connecting them if I have yet to sort the dots?
Sort of lost and very found at the same time
I pour the cost, now I'm very loud in a daytime
And very quiet at night- seem to shine when I write
And I'm longing to be a five-year-old, chilling, flying a kite
And I admire the sight of somebody else working more than me
I've been staying grounded, but the sky is moving towards my feet
And fortunately, I'm on course, living morally
Grinding to get what's rightfully mine, I'm headed right for my dream
Damn, I guess that's all I need to know for now
They put me in the driver's seat, no way I'm slowing down
They know me now but don't know my sound, it is so profound
Give m- two years and I'll make it, let me show you how
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy

I gotta stop all of this bragging shit
So many haters, S.M.H. is the acronym
I'm trying to get a couple "OMG"'s
Or a, "WTF, he is so sexy"
I got no Bentley, beat is so deadly
Walked up to the rap club, no entry
And I feel a little like I won't get seen
'Cause I'm so white, won't fight, don't get me
'Cause I'm coming at this music with a different set of ideas
Trying to bring my own crib like it's Ikea
Here's a pro-tip: take no tips
From people who aren't pros yet, bitches always so stressed
Damn, 'cause they trying to find that great escape
Nation of dreamers who all just trying to stay awake
Every day, I be waking up to my 808s
Day-to-day hustle, I'm just trying to pave a way
People with the problems always give the most advice
Like, why don't you search your own life? Don't come close to mine
I'm mostly fine, so please leave me alone to whine
And next time that you're talking shit, please bring me an open mind
'Cause people locking they own ideas in straitjackets
I'm David Blaine's magic- helping you break past it
I'm trying to raise havoc, not trying to stay savage
Trying to make balance while finding a great passion
Climbing to get up this- witnessin' injustice
By who people in love with or based off of skin colors-
Shit is so disgusting- seeing it in public
I'm trying to make sense of it here in the discussions-
Close my eyes and go to sleep, waiting until they notice me
Wait until my creations are making everything so complete
My thoughts are scattered- find lots of patterns
I try not to let it get my plots in ashes

I don't ever think I've- some money, some- little talent
These rappers shows look like lip-sync battles with Jimmy Fallon
What really happened? I'm jealous of people selling platinum
Worst year of my life? That's like saying the worst Kendrick album
Is way better than average, I'm already established
Unforgettable classic, y'all shit is set to go plastic
They want to see me disappear like incredible magic
Your regrettable attitude is upsetting my passion
I'm getting listens and places, fuck all the simpler days
I just took a moo- mon- break- I got Spotify paying me minimum wage
I'm like that's good enough, man, I've been eating, ain't full enough, I just want to make it pulling up
I've been putting up with all of these amateurs, sure enough, I'ma show 'em how it should be done

I got green and I want beef like a omnivore
I got that exclusive flow that can't be bought at stores-
All this new shit, they still be wanting more
They say that my duty is not fair like some modern war
I'm stacking rolls, just like the Michelin Man
Eating sushi every night, but I don't live in Japan
Damn, I'm trying to get as many hits as I can
And like a lazy ass beaver, I ain't giving a damn
Whoa, this shit is corny, you're really gonna ignore me?
You really gon' let it slide when these Benjamins do adore me?
And as we rise, man, it ain't about fame and fortune
We got a greater importance, that's why I wake in the morning
I'm tryna play a performance- make a change with a chorus
I came from a tiny platform, but now my stage is enormous
Flawless, do anything to stay out of office
'Cause I'm cautious, not gonna sell my soul for the profits

Yeah, I got many dreams, lot of passions
I'mma get there by any means, just imagine
Just know that anything can happen
Take chances, put everything in rapping
I don't even really need to go fast
Flow back, not wandering like a nomad
So glad, yeah, they all melt like a snowman
Back-to-back flames got Drake saying, "Oh, man"
Not again, got a lot of friends who want to end
All my shit, unsubscribe, like I'm On Demand
I've been living in a moment, got a lot of fans
Pedophile, back at it again with the white vans
Can't lie, man, I got a lot of white fans
Could I get a ultralight beam, maybe by chance?
Every day I've been switching up on my stance
Scare everyone away whenever I dance
People in the comments saying that I can't rap
Okay? 'Cause I didn't understand that
Fuck you, man, I think it's time to stand back
You'll be sitting, getting in the way like a sandbag
If you want to talk trash, say it to my face
I'll be singing, "La-la", I got two L.A.-
I be laughing, "Haha" at the human race
Hey, I'm in the lead, not far from a newer place
Uh- getting sick and sicker
The flow on the track getting quicker and quicker
Shiver me timbers, I'm winning these bigger
Killer victor, not swiping left like it's Tinder
They filter my picture, put it in bad light-
Uh, me playing these rappers is a bad fight
Ayy, me spitting these bars, that's a mad sight
Haters be changing their opinions, is that right?
Ayy, ayy, ayy
I'm winnin’- I'm winnin’- I’m spitting’ a million words per the minute
I’m in it to win it, I’m in it to win it, I'm fixin to hit it
This shit is my mission, not up to opinions
You know that I’m grinnin’, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy

But I don't want to be a ribbon in the sky
Living in disguise, man, I see the venom in the middle of they eyes
Figure if you living or you die
'Cause it's time for you to finish your reply
I've been dealing with these guys
Know that I am blacking out that so I
Guess I'm automatically back when you
Died of a bad guy and better than like
Hi for these actors I've dated like a
Battery pack that a blackberry add on a
Stack of his tab revving as the bath of
A tag to send him a shout back to Iraq
Then leave a crack gun imagine put my
Train of thought right back on the track
Oh these drivers out of breath

Attack yeah mass, mass, mass Megan flames

Great plate, great escape

I lost my style
I lost my style.. okay
That was a- actually a pretty good freestyle, damn

-Money on the run, that's running business
-Do this shit for fun? That's some decision
Coming in this, I wondered, "Is this a road that they'll be fucking with?"
They loving it, making paper, like Dunder Mifflin
Still got haters and doubters I keep on running into
-Got a problem? Hop on the track, I'd love to diss you
People hate on successes, you got some fucking issues
Like- damn, need me to get you another tissue?
Just please don't go- come back, no one'll miss you
Well, I won't, I'll shrug my shoulders and just continue
On my mission, encountered a lot of villains
I'm kicking them down repeatedly lyrically, like it's some Jujitsu

Uh, damn
You know that I am the fucking man
Uh, I'ma make this money, make a hundred grand
I don't really think that you'll understand
Understand, 'cause I'm back again
A fan again, I'm going to war, like Afghanistan
What's the plan?
The plan- the plan, man, to plan me?
I'ma do the shit, I'ma do the same thing

Celebrating, every day I'm drinking champagne
Ooh, andnd you're gonna know my damn name
Gonna know my last name, now they see me in the rap game
Uh, they look at me like, "How that changed"
But- truly nothing even changed, though
Uh, all these rappers got the same flow
So it's good to evolve, like Play-Doh
'Cause I get molded-I get molded every day, bro
Every day, bro, but I ain't Jake Paul
Sliding into home base with your bitch; baseball
Hey! And now, you're gonna go fall
Uh, but you know I'm gonna go far

I got people, now you know I'm going so far
So far but I'm never gonna backtrack

It was a Monday
A day like any other day
I left a small town
For the Apple in decay
It was my destiny
It's what we needed to do
They were telling me
I'm telling you

I was inside looking outside
The millions of faces
But still I'm alone
Waiting, hours of waiting
Paying a penance
I was longing for home

I'm looking out for the two of us
I hope we'll be here when they're through with us

I was inside looking outside
Oh the millions of faces
But still I'm alone
Waiting, hours of waiting
I could feel the tension
I was longing for home
I'm looking out for the two of us
And I hope we'll be here when they're through with us
I'm a long way from home

Monday, sad, sad Monday
She's waiting for me
But I'm a long, long way from home
Sad, sad Monday
She's waiting for me
But I'm a long, long way from home
Sad, sad Monday
She's waiting for me
But I'm a long, long way from home



Well Randy, Ra’zul, and I set out for Lakeridge. (yes we did)
And what we found was Bradward’s Bowl. (the old punch bowl)
We fought the Trio of Chairs down in the basement. (and broke the rules)
I threw a pig and made a goal. (piggy pig)

Then Wesley came along, and said he liked our song
And we rode out for Silkgrove in the morn
He cut us off some string, from his spider’s booty seam
And that’s when Chaos Sauce was born

Well Randy, Ra’zul, and I killed us some spiders. (eight-legged freaks)
Dodging traps up around the bend. (CCR)
Wesley reappeared and made us an offer. (lock us up)
When we refused he called his friend. (ettercap)

Faced with a deadly foe, our instrument aglow
We rocked out a fatal jam
The ettercap was caught
Mashed up and burned a lot
And Wesley ran away

Yeah, make some noise

Baby, here I am, a man on the scene
I give you what you want, got you comin' home with me
Got all my love, little more in store
Get through throwin' it on you, you got to come back for more

Boys and things that come by the dozen, did you know?
That ain't nothin' but drugstore lovin'
Pretty little thing, let me light your candle
'Cause, mama, I'm sure hard to handle now, yes, sir, I am

Action speaks louder than words, man of experience
Got you another man, I can love you better than him
Man, don't be afraid, prove every word I say
Advertising love for free, place your ad with me

Boys like dimes around by the dozen, ten cent lovin'
Pretty little thing, let me light your candle
'Cause, mama, I'm sure hard to handle now, yes, sir, I am
Yeah, gotta get it hard
Baby, I am, on the scene
Give you, give you, give you what you want, baby
Come on home with me
Got all my love, little more in store
Throwin' shit on you, back for more

Boys like dimes around by the dozen, drugstore love
Pretty little thing, let me light your candle
'Cause, mama, I'm sure hard to handle now, yes, sir, I am
Yeah, got to get hard
Jeffrey Cease


Boys like dimes around by the dozen, ten cent love

This song, we call it "Shake, Shake, Shake, Shake, Shake 'Em On Down"



Ooh, you make me live
Whatever this world can give to me
It's you, you're all I see
Ooh, you make me live now, honey
Ooh, you make me live

Oh, you're the best friend that I ever had
I've been with you such a long time
You're my sunshine
And I want you to know
That my feelings are true
I really love you
(Ooh) Oh, you're my best friend

Ooh, you make me live
Ooh, I've been wandering 'round ('round)
But still come back to you
(Ooh, still come back to you)
In rain or shine, you've stood by me girl (girl)
I'm happy at home

You're my best friend
Ooh, you make me live
Whenever this world is cruel to me
I got you to help me forgive
Ooh, you make me live now, honey
Ooh, you make me live

Oh, you're the first one
When things turn out bad
You know I'll never be lonely
You're my only one
And I love the things
I really love the things that you do
Oh, you're my best friend (Oh)

Ooh, you make me live
(Live, live, live)
I'm happy at home
You're my best friend
Oh, you're my best friend

Ooh, you make me live, ooh
Ooh, you're my best friend



I wanna run, I want to hide
I wanna tear down the walls
That hold me inside
I wanna reach out
And touch the flame
Where the streets have no name

I wanna feel sunlight on my face
I see the dust-cloud
Disappear without a trace
I wanna take shelter
From the poison rain
Where the streets have no name

Where the streets have no name
Where the streets have no name
We're still building and burning down love
Burning down love
And when I go there
I go there with you
It's all I can do

The city's a flood, and our love turns to rust
We're beaten and blown by the wind
Trampled in dust
I'll show you a place
High on a desert plain, yeah
Where the streets have no name, ah-ha
Where the streets have no name
Where the streets have no name
We're still building and burning down love
Burning down love
And when I go there
I go there with you
It's all I can do

Our love turns to rust
We're beaten and blown by the wind
Blown by the wind
Oh and I see love
See our love turn to rust
We're beaten and blown by the wind
Blown by the wind
Oh when I go there
I go there with you
It's all I can do



We skipped the light fandango
Turned cartwheels 'cross the floor
I was feeling kinda seasick
But the crowd called out for more
The room was humming harder
As the ceiling flew away
When we called out for another drink
The waiter brought a tray

And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face, at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale


She said, there is no reason
And the truth is plain to see
But I wandered through my playing cards
And would not let her be
One of sixteen vestal virgins
Who were leaving for the coast
And although my eyes were open
They might have just as well've been closed
And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale


She said, 'I'm home on shore leave,'
Though in truth we were at sea
So I took her by the looking glass
And forced her to agree
Saying, 'You must be the mermaid
Who took Neptune for a ride.'
But she smiled at me so sadly
That my anger straightway died

And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale
If music be the food of love
Then laughter is its queen
And likewise if behind is in front
Then dirt in truth is clean
My mouth by then like cardboard
Seemed to slip straight through my head
So we crash-dived straightway quickly
And attacked the ocean bed
And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale



Well, I started out down a dirty road
Started out all alone
And the sun went down as I crossed the hill
And the town lit up, the world got still

I'm learning to fly but I ain't got wings
Coming down is the hardest thing

Well, the good old days may not return
And the rocks might melt and the sea may burn

I'm learning to fly (Learning to fly)
But I ain't got wings (Learning to fly)
Coming down (Learning to fly)
Is the hardest thing (Learning to fly)

Well, some say life will beat you down
Break your heart, steal your crown
So I've started out for God knows where
I guess I'll know when I get there
I'm learning to fly around the clouds
But what goes up (Learning to fly)
Must come down

I'm learning to fly (Learning to fly)
But I ain't got wings
Coming down is the hardest thing
I'm learning to fly (Learning to fly)
Around the clouds
But what goes up (Learning to fly)
Must come down
I'm learning to fly (Learning to fly, learning to fly)
I'm learning to fly (Learning to fly, learning to fly)
(Learning to fly, learning to fly)



Well, its eight o'clock in Boise, Idaho
I'll find my limo driver
Mister, take us to the show

I'll find a little queen
And I know I can treat her right
What's your name, little girl?
What's your name?
Shootin' you straight, little girl?
Won't you do the same?
Back at the hotel
Lord we got such a mess
It seems that one of the crew
Had a go with one of the guests, oh yes
Well, the police said we can't drink in the bar
What a shame
Won't you come upstairs girl
And have a drink of champagne
What's your name, little girl?
What's your name?
Shootin' you straight, little girl?
Won't you do the same?
What's your name, little girl?
What's your name?
Shootin' you straight, little girl?
Won't you do the same?

What's your name, little girl?
What's your name?
Shootin' you straight, little girl?

Nine o'clock the next day

To do one more show, oh no
Can I get you a taxi home
It sure was grand
When I come back here next year
I want to see you again
What was your name, little girl?
What's your name?
Shootin' you straight, little girl?
Well there ain't no shame
What's was name, little girl?
What's your name?
Shootin' you straight, little girl?
Won't you do the same?

It's the time of the season
When the love runs high
In this time, give it to me easy
And let me try with pleasured hands

To take you in the sun to (promised lands)
To show you every one
It's the time of the season for loving
What's your name? (What’s your name?)
Who's your daddy? (Who's your daddy?)
(He rich?) Is he rich like me?
Has he taken (Has he taken)
Any time (Any time)
(To show) To show you what you need to live?

Tell it to me slowly (tell you what?)
I really want to know
It's the time of the season for loving
​

What's your name? (What’s your name?)
Who's your daddy? (Who's your daddy?)
(He rich?) Is he rich like me?
Has he taken (Has he taken)
Any time (Any time)

I got the call today, I didn't wanna hear
But I knew that it would come
An old true friend of ours was talkin' on the phone
She said you found someone

And I thought of all the bad luck
And the struggles we went through
And how I lost me
And you lost you
What are these voices outside love's open door
Make us throw off our contentment
And beg for something more?

But I'm learning to live without you now
But I miss you sometimes
The more I know, the less I understand
All the things I thought I knew
I'm learning again

I've been tryin' to get down
To the heart of the matter
But my will gets weak
And my thoughts seem to scatter
But I think it's about
Forgiveness, forgiveness
Even if, even if
You don't love me anymore
These times are so uncertain
There's a yearning undefined
And people filled with rage
We all need a little tenderness
How can love survive
In such a graceless age?

The trust and self-assurance
That lead to happiness
They're the very things
We kill, I guess
Oh, pride and competition
Cannot fill these empty arms
And the work I put between us
You know it doesn't keep me warm

I'm learning to live without you now
But I miss you, baby
The more I know, the less I understand
All the things I thought I figured out
I have to learn again

I've been tryin' to get down
To the heart of the matter
But everything changes
And my friends seem to scatter
But I think it's about
Forgiveness, forgiveness
Even if, even if
You don't love me anymore
There are people in your life
Who've come and gone
They let you down
You know they hurt your pride
You better put it all behind you, baby
Cause life goes on
You keep carrying that anger
It'll eat you up inside, baby

I've been tryin' to get down
To the heart of the matter
But my will gets weak
And my thoughts seem to scatter
But I think it's about
Forgiveness, forgiveness
Even if, even if
You don't love me

I've been tryin' to get down
To the heart of the matter
Because the flesh will get weak
And the ashes will scatter
So I'm thinking about
Forgiveness, forgiveness
Even if, even if
You don't love me
Forgiveness
(Yeah)
Forgiveness
(Baby)
Forgiveness
(Oh, oh)
Forgiveness
(Ah, yeah)
Forgiveness
(Oh)
Forgiveness
Even if
You don't love me anymore
Forgiveness
(Oh)
Forgiveness
(Ohh)
Forgiveness
Forgiveness
(heyy yeah)



You show us everything you've got
You keep on dancin' and the room gets hot
You drive us wild, we'll drive you crazy
You say you wanna go for a spin
The party's just begun, we'll let you in

Flew in from Miami Beach BOAC
Didn't get to bed last night
On the way, the paper bag was on my knee
Man, I had a dreadful flight

I'm back in the U.S.S.R.​
You don't know how lucky you are, boy
Back in the U.S.S.R. (Yeah)

Been away so long, I hardly knew the place
Gee, it's good to be back home
Leave it til' tomorrow to unpack my case
Honey, disconnect the phone

I'm back in the U.S.S.R
You don't know how lucky you are, boy
Back in the U.S
Back in the U.S
Back in the U.S.S.R.​

Well, the Ukraine girls really knock me out
They leave the West behind
And Moscow girls make me sing and shout
That Georgia's always on my mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mind
Oh, come on!

Yeah, I'm back in the U.S.S.R.​

That Georgia's always on my mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mind

Oh show me round your snow-peaked mountains way down south
Take me to your daddy's farm
Let me hear your balalaikas ringing out
Come and keep your comrade warm

I'm back in the U.S.S.R. (Hey)
You don't know how lucky you are, boys
Back in the U.S.S.R

Oh, let me tell you, honey
Hey, I'm back, I'm back in the U.S.S.R.​
Hey, it's so good to be home
Yeah, back in the U.S.S.R.​



After midnight, we're going to let it all hang down

We're going to stimulate some action
We're going to get some satisfaction
We're going to find out what it is all about
After midnight, we're going to let it all hang down

After midnight, we're going to shake your tambourine
After midnight, it's all going to be peaches and cream

Only love can make it rain
The way the beach is kissed by the sea
Only love can make it rain
Like the sweat of lovers laying in the fields

Love reign o'er me
Rain o'er me
Love reign o'er me
Rain o'er me
Rain o'er me

Only love can bring the rain
That makes you yearn to the sky
Only love can bring the rain
That falls like tears from on high

Love reign o'er me
Rain o'er me
Love reign o'er me
Rain o'er me
Rain o'er me
On the dry and dusty road
The nights we spend apart alone
I need to get back home to cool cool rain
I can't sleep and I lay and I think
The night is hot and black as ink
Oh God, I need a drink of cool cool rain


Love reign o'er me
Rain over me, over me, over me!
Love reign o'er me
Rain o'er me
Rain o'er me

Love!

Would you get behind them
If you could only find them?

She's my baby

Well it's all right, riding around in the breeze
Well it's all right, if you live the life you please
Well it's all right, doing the best you can
Well it's all right, as long as you lend a hand

You can sit around and wait for the phone to ring
Waiting for someone to tell you everything
Sit around and wonder what tomorrow will bring
Maybe a diamond ring

Well it's all right, even if they say you're wrong
Well it's all right, sometimes you gotta be strong
Well it's all right, as long as you got somewhere to lay
Well it's all right, everyday is Judgement Day

Maybe somewhere down the road away
You'll think of me, and wonder where I am these days
Maybe somewhere down the road when somebody plays
Purple haze
Well it's all right, even when push comes to shove
Well it's all right, if you got someone to love
Well it's all right, everything'll work out fine
Well it's all right, we're going to the end of the line
Don't have to be ashamed of the car I drive
I'm just glad to be here, happy to be alive
It don't matter if you're by my side
I'm satisfied

Well it's all right, even if you're old and grey
Well it's all right, you still got something to say
Well it's all right, remember to live and let live
Well it's all right, the best you can do is forgive
Well it's all right, riding around in the breeze
Well it's all right, if you live the life you please
Well it's all right, even if the sun don't shine
Well it's all right, we're going to the end of the line



I can see very well
There's a boat on the reef with a broken back
And I can see it very well
There's a joke and I know it very well
It's one of those that I told you long ago
Take my word, I'm a madman, don't you know

Once a fool had a good part in the play
If it's so would I still be here today?
It's quite peculiar in a funny sort of way
They think it's very funny everything I say
Get a load of him, he's so insane
You better get your coat, dear, it looks like rain

We'll come again next Thursday afternoon
The In-laws hope they'll see you very soon
But is it in your conscience that you're after
Another glimpse of the Madman across the Water

I can see very well
There's a boat on the reef with a broken back
And I can see it very well
There's a joke and I know it very well
It's one of those that I told you long ago
Take my word, I'm a madman, don't you know
The ground's a long way down but I need more
Is the nightmare black or are the windows painted?
Will they come again next week, can my mind really take it?

We'll come again next Thursday afternoon
The In-laws hope they'll see you very soon
But is it in your conscience that you're after
Another glimpse of the Madman across the Water



Oh, hello Mr. Soul
I dropped by to pick up a reason
For the thought that I caught that my head
Is the event of the season
Why in crowds just a trace of my face
Could seem so pleasin'
I'll cop out to the change
But a stranger is putting the tease on

I was down on a frown
When the messenger brought me a letter
I was raised by the praise of a fan
Who said I upset her
Any girl in the world
Could have easily known me better
She said, "You're strange
But don't change" and I let her

In a while will the smile on my face
Turn to plaster?
Stick around while the clown who is sick
Does the trick of disaster
For the race of my head and my face
Is moving much faster
Is it strange, I should change?
I don't know, why don't you ask her?
Is it strange, I should change?
I don't know, why don't you ask her?
Is it strange, I should change?
I don't know, why don't you ask her?
Is it strange, I should change?
I don't know, why don't you ask her?
Is it strange, I should change?
I don't know, why don't you...



If it keeps on raining, levee's going to break
If it keeps on raining, the levee's going to break
When the levee breaks, we'll have no place to stay

Mean old levee, taught me to weep and moan, oh
Mean old levee, taught me to weep and moan
It's got what it takes to make a mountain man leave his home
Oh well, oh well, oh well
Ooh

Oh, don't it make you feel bad
When you're trying to find your way home
You don't know which way to go
If you're going down south, they got no work to do
If you're going north to Chicago
Ah, ah, ah, hey


Crying won't help you, praying won't do you no good
No, crying won't help you, praying won't do you no good
When the levee breaks, mama, you got to move, ooh
All last night I sat on the levee and moaned
All last night, sat on the levee and moaned
Thinking about my baby and my happy home
Oh-ho

Ah, ah, ah, ah-ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah-ah
Oh, oh

Going
I'm going to Chicago
Going to Chicago
Sorry, but I can't take you, ah
Going down, going down now
Going down, I'm going down now
Going down, going down
Going down, going down
Oh
Going down, going down now
Going down, going down now
Going down, going down now
Going down, going, dow- dow- dow- dow- down now
Ooh, ooh



Green-eyed lady, lovely lady
Strolling slowly towards the sun
Green-eyed lady, ocean lady
Soothing every raging wave that comes
Green-eyed lady, passion's lady
Dressed in love, she lives for life to be
Green-eyed lady feels life I never see
Setting suns and lonely lovers free
Green-eyed lady, wind-swept lady
Rules the night, the waves, the sand
Green-eyed lady, ocean lady
Child of nature, friend of man
Green-eyed lady, passion's lady
Dressed in love, she lives for life to be
Green-eyed lady feels life I never see
Setting suns and lonely lovers free



Hey, little girl, is your daddy home?
Did he go away and leave you all alone?
I got a bad desire

Oh, oh, oh
I'm on fire

Tell me now, baby, is he good to you?
And can he do to you the things that I do?
Oh no, I can take you higher

Oh, oh, oh
I'm on fire

Sometimes it's like someone took a knife, baby, edgy and dull
And cut a six-inch valley through the middle of my skull
At night, I wake up with the sheets soakin' wet
And a freight train runnin' through the middle of my head
Only you can cool my desire

Oh, oh, oh
I'm on fire
Oh, oh, oh
I'm on fire
Oh, oh, oh
I'm on fire
Ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh



I'm back
I'm back in the saddle again
I'm back
I'm back in the saddle again

Riding into town alone
By the light of the moon
I'm looking for old Sukie Jones
She crazy horse saloon
Barkeep give me a drink
That's when she caught my eye
She turned to give me a wink
That'd make a grown man cry

I'm back in the saddle again
I'm back
I'm back in the saddle again
I'm back

Come easy, go easy
All right until the rising sun
I'm calling all the shots tonight
I'm like a loaded gun
Peeling off my boots and chaps
I'm saddle sore
Four bits gets you time in the racks
I scream for more
Fool's gold out of their mines
The girls are soaking wet
No tongue's drier than mine
I'll come when I get back
I'm back in the saddle again
I'm back
I'm back in the saddle again

I'm riding, I'm loading up my pistol
I'm riding, I really got a fistful
I'm riding, I'm shining up my saddle
I'm riding, this snake is gonna rattle

I'm back in the saddle again
I'm back
I'm back in the saddle again
I'm back

Riding high
Riding high
Riding high already



Doctor, my eyes have seen the years
And the slow parade of fears without crying
Now I want to understand
I have done all that I could
To see the evil and the good without hiding
You must help me if you can

Doctor, my eyes
Tell me what is wrong
Was I unwise to leave them open for so long?

'Cause I have wandered through this world
And as each moment has unfurled
I've been waiting to awaken from these dreams
People go just where they will
I never noticed them until I got this feeling
That it's later than it seems

Doctor, my eyes
Tell me what you see
I hear their cries
Just say if it's too late for me

Doctor, my eyes
Cannot see the sky
Is this the prize
For having learned how not to cry?



Hello, baby, hello
Haven't seen your face for a while
Have you quit doing time for me
Or are you still the same spoiled child?
Hello, I said hello
Is this the only place you thought to go
Am I the only man you ever had
Or am I just the last surviving friend
That you know?

Harmony and me, we're pretty good company
Looking for an island in our boat upon the sea
Harmony, gee, I really love you and I wanna love you forever
And dream of never, never, never leaving harmony

Hello, baby, hello
Open up your heart and let your feelings flow
You're not unlucky knowing me
Keeping the speed real slow
In any case I set my own pace by stealing the show
Say hello, hello
Ah!
Harmony and me, we're pretty good company
Looking for an island in our boat upon the sea
Harmony, gee, I really love you and I want to love you forever
And dream of never, never, never leaving harmony

Never leaving harmony
Harmony
Harmony
Harmony
Harmony
Harmony
Harmony
Harmony
Ah-ah!



Lady Madonna, children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet
Who finds the money when you pay the rent?
Did you think that money was heaven sent?

Friday night arrives without a suitcase
Sunday morning creeping like a nun
Monday's child has learned to tie his bootlace
See how they run

Lady Madonna, baby at your breast
Wonders how you manage to feed the rest

See how they run

Lady Madonna lying on the bed
Listen to the music playing in your head
Tuesday afternoon is never ending
Wednesday morning papers didn't come
Thursday night your stockings needed mending
See how they run

Lady Madonna, children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet



There's a cherry on top tonight
For men who look like jesus tonight
If you play your cards right
You can be the the son of god tonight
You were thin you were undersized for the spring
You entered your name just as  “tight blue jeans”
In my phone I guess you do this kind of thing
Ahh yeah
Well we met on the floor
CCR was playing
“long as i can see the light”
They were singing
You gave me the look
That said “lets be animals tonight”
”right away we were synthesized"
So we took off
Down sunset boulevard
The back tires were spinning
The axles they were teething us into beyond
Way out on that boulevard
We can be weightless, timeless
Tonight  you are heavy on my mind
I watched you
Drift behind  my eyes
I try to roll with the punches I  flow with the tide
Guess i thought you’d be forever
You’re now with me never
Moments of heaven
Frozen in a van  with you girl
I miss the lightness of laughter with you
So I tear out to sunset blvd
Yeah my back tires
They are spinning
The axles they are teething me
Into beyond
Way out on that blvd
I can be weightless
I can be timeless…
So far down  sunset blvd
Yeah my back tires are spinning
My axles they are teething me
Into beyond
Way out on that blvd
Way out on that blvd
Way out on that precious blvd
We can be weightless
Timeless…



Climbing up on Solsbury Hill
I could see the city light
Wind was blowing, time stood still
Eagle flew out of the night
He was something to observe
Came in close, I heard a voice
Standing stretching every nerve
Had to listen, had no choice

I did not believe the information
I just had to trust imagination
My heart going boom boom boom
"Son," he said
"Grab your things, I've come to take you home"

To keep in silence I resigned
My friends would think I was a nut
Turning water into wine
Open doors would soon be shut
So I went from day to day
Though my life was in a rut
'Til I thought of what I'd say
Which connection I should cut
I was feeling part of the scenery
I walked right out of the machinery
My heart going boom boom boom
"Hey," he said
"Grab your things, I've come to take you home"
Ay, back home

When illusion spin her net
I'm never where I want to be
And liberty she pirouette
When I think that I am free
Watched by empty silhouettes
Who close their eyes but still can see
No one taught them etiquette
I will show another me

Today I don't need a replacement
I'll tell them what the smile on my face meant
My heart going boom boom boom
"Hey" I said
"You can keep my things, they've come to take me home"



Just a castaway, an island lost at sea, oh
Another lonely day
With no one here but me, oh
More loneliness than any man could bear
Rescue me before I fall into despair, oh

I'll send an SOS to the world
I'll send an SOS to the world
I hope that someone gets my
I hope that someone gets my
I hope that someone gets my
Message in a bottle (Yeah)
Message in a bottle (Yeah)

A year has passed since I wrote my note
I should have known this right from the start
Only hope can keep me together
Love can mend your life
But love can break your heart

I'll send an SOS to the world
I'll send an SOS to the world
I hope that someone gets my
I hope that someone gets my

Message in a bottle (Yeah)

Walked out this morning
Don't believe what I saw
Hundred billion bottles
Washed up on the shore
Seems I'm not alone at being alone
Hundred billion castaways
Looking for a home

I'll send an SOS to the world
I'll send an SOS to the world
I hope that someone gets my
I hope that someone gets my
I hope that someone gets my
Message in a bottle (Yeah)

Would you know my name if I saw you in heaven?
Would it be the same if I saw you in heaven?
I must be strong and carry on
‘Cause I know I don't belong
Here in heaven

Would you hold my hand if I saw you in heaven?
Would you help me stand if I saw you in heaven?
I'll find my way through night and day
‘Cause I know I just can't stay
Here in heaven

Time can bring you down, time can bend your knees
Time can break your heart, have you begging please
Begging please


Beyond the door, there's peace, I'm sure
And I know there'll be no more
Tears in heaven
Would you know my name if I saw you in heaven?
Would you feel the same if I saw you in heaven?
I must be strong and carry on
Because I know I don't belong
Here in heaven



We rented a truck and a semi to go
Travel down the long and winding road
Look on the map, I think we've been here before
Close up the doors, let's roll once more
Cop on the corner, look he's startin' to write
I don't need no ticket so I screamed out of sight
Drove so fast that my eyes can't see
Look in the mirror, is he still followin' me?
Let it roll down the highway
Let it roll down the highway, roll, roll
Look at the sign, we're in the wrong place
Move out, boys, and let's get ready to race
454's coming over the hill
The man on patrol's going to give us a bill
Time's real short, you know the distance is long
I'd rather have a jet but it's not in the song
Climb back in the cab, cross your fingers for luck
We gotta keep movin' if we're going to make a buck
Let it roll down the highway
Let it roll down the highway, roll
Let it roll, let it roll, let it roll
Let it roll, let it roll
Let it roll down the highway
Let it roll down the highway, roll, roll
Roll down the highway
Let it roll down the highway, roll, roll, roll
Let it roll down the highway
Let it roll down the highway, roll, roll, roll



Wha, yeah!
C'mon, yeah
Yeah, c'mon, yeah
Yeah, c'mon
Oh, yeah, ma

Yeah, I'm a back door man
I'm a back door man
The men don't know
But the little girl understand

Hey, all you people that tryin' to sleep
I'm out to make it with my midnight creep, yeah
Because I'm a back door man
The men don't know
But the little girls understand
All right, yeah

You men eat your dinner
Eat your pork and beans
I eat more chicken
Than any man ever seen, yeah, yeah
I'm a back door man, wha
The men don't know
But the little girls understand
Well, I'm a back door man
I'm a back door man
Whoa, baby, I'm a back door man
The men don't know
But the little girls understand



I'm sailing away
Set an open course for the Virgin Sea
'Cause I've got to be free
Free to face the life that's ahead of me
On board I'm the captain, so climb aboard
We'll search for tomorrow on every shore
And I'll try, oh Lord, I'll try to carry on

I look to the sea
Reflections in the waves spark my memory
Some happy, some sad
I think of childhood friends, and the dreams we had
We lived happily forever, so the story goes
But somehow we missed out on the pot of gold
But we'll try best that we can, to carry on

A gathering of angels appeared above my head
They sang to me this song of hope, and this is what they said

They said: Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me, lads
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me, babe
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me

I thought that they were angels, but to my surprise
We climbed aboard their starship, we headed for the skies

Singing come sail away, come sail away, come sail with me, lads
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me



If I needed someone to love
You're the one that I'd be thinking of
If I needed someone

If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess I'd be with you my friend
If I needed someone

Had you come some other day
Then it might not have been like this
But you see now I'm too much in love

Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah, ah, ah, ah

If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess I'd be with you my friend
If I needed someone
Had you come some other day
Then it might not have been like this
But you see now I'm too much in love

Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah, ah



{Intro}

Somebody's gonna hurt someone
Before the night is through
Somebody's gonna come undone
There's nothin' we can do
Everybody wants to touch somebody
If it takes all night
Everybody wants to take a little chance
Make it come out right

There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight, I know
There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight, I know
Lord, I know

Some people like to stay out late
Some folks can't hold out that long
But nobody wants to go home now
There's too much goin' on
This night is gonna last forever
Last all, last all summer long
Some time before the sun comes up
The radio is gonna play that song
There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight, I know
There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight, I know
Lord, I know
There's gonna be a heartache tonight
The moon's shinin' bright
So turn out the light and we'll get it right
There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight, I know
Heartache, baby
{Instrumental Bridge}

Somebody's gonna hurt someone (somebody)
Before the night is through
Somebody's gonna come undone
There's nothin' we can do
(Everybody) Everybody wants to touch somebody
If it takes all night
Everybody wants to take a little chance
To make it come out right
There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight, I know
There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight, I know
Let's go
We can beat around the bushes
We can get down to the bone
We can leave it in the parkin' lot
But either way, there's gonna be a
Heartache tonight, a heartache tonight, I know (Lord, I know)
There'll be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight, I know
Woohoo!!!
{Outro}
(Break my heart)



I been buzzin' wit' the cheat code...
This just another free throw
Get you a feeding tube, IV, another one where pee go
Hooked to three cords (chords) your whole life...Mustard on the beat, ho
E go, son is dumb
Feds who we runnin' from
Turned me to a lizard - y'all ain't listen where I'm comin' from
'Cause every time I lose a tail, I just gain another one
It's reptile for Prep now
Flash one of these
Shot off a tripod - Prep, bad things come in threes
I'm a master wit' the leash
Criticize my lines
I made nice wit' y'all advice, trust the vision's on the rise
Van Gogh: y'all paint me like I listen half the time
Bitch, this isn't by design
Never do we mention...
You named after a gimmick, was never too invested
Will disguise to gain eyes, pitiful intention
But he's gettin' what he wanted, but it's medical attention
This ain't Battle of the Vets, it's a battle of the death
I never rattle, Prep just battle, got his apple gettin' stretched
Put him in the ER - (*long, sharp gasp*) - gaspin' for his breath
They ain't teachin' you to swim and they yell "Paddle" on your chest!
Bitch, this cat is from the West
Grind upliftin'
Your time's up, rhymes stuck, get lined up vicious
Roy Jones: showboat and you gon' wind up different
Bitch, pine box liftin'
I can't let the Town lose
I'm drawin' hopscotch, Prep: let's just set the ground rules
Plottin' nigga found you, path won't work
This is Yoda talkin': I'mma get the last word first
In the black vert' skrrt
When the mask down, worry
Your past sound passed down
You blast round, "Jersey"
All those pics is Portrait Mode: your background blurry
I'mma step into the Garden
These vets acheivin' stardom?
Three battles, six weeks - y'all thought Prep would be a problem!?
I'm professional
Let you know...burner is this big
Leg shot, the kickback turned to a shin dig (shindig)!
I ain't wanna do it! (*chuckles*)
If you plottin' somethin', prove it
Cave his chest in, you'll get wheezy (Weezy) first - (*gasp*) - that's just Undisputed
I'mma Skip to somethin' Sharp(e)
You overpower when you rap
This is one round, baby, and know I'm comin' back
These are gems I am givin' you
Know what you listenin' to
Today's the last time you will witness a miracle
You got robbed? That's honestly what you feel happened to you last week?
You watched 25 slip through your hands
That "robbed" narrative is a damn reach
You went from bein' the favorite to bein' pushed behind
The last thing a Kennedy should ever wanna do is take the backseat!
Actually, it's a little change to the story
Tony Bro and Goodz picked you, Meth picked him
All you needed was her to make up the void
This ain't the lane for you, boy!
They can't market you!
How can E sell (Ezal) if he flipped when it came to the 40!?
Things'll get gory
I want this nigga to think I'm soft
Drama, go from minor to major, like I changed the course
I ain't been here since I battled Loso!
Didn't think I would take a loss
Missed my last shot, so they gave me E
I guess I'm playin' H-O-R-S-E!
Gang involved, these niggas actually shooters
Go from 50 to 30: I'm passin' a Trooper!
Miss a shot, I spin the block, grabbin' the Ruger
This time? Machines in the whip: Back to the Future!
As for this loser? Bruh, I could really give you some game
Your pen? FIRE, but- but your delivery ain't
Presence, crowd control, shit you learn when you get on the stage
You never been on one, E (knee) - that's why you can't get 'em engaged!
This is the thing...I respect you bein' a activist
Givin' speeches to the youth, tryna save the children
I'm on the total opposite shit, so for me, it's gon' take a minute
The problem? He Magic Johnson
Y'all got this positive nigga in the league, and I ain't playin' wit' him!
I'm at the place he livin', tryna kick it in
He got the hinges tightened
Fuck that! .40, to get through the door, like ticket prices!
CHAOS! Ain't no Headshot!
What he get tonight is leg shot, between the opp' shins (options): I'm indecisive
Don't get my kindness confused for weakness
Know what's important
Your dome'll be pourin'
Miss a payment, I'm at your brother home while he yawnin'
Since he already owe (radio), I'm airin' E bro (Ebro) in the Morning
Should've ignored 'em
You just took a loss, you shoulda sat down
P called, said, "We got Geechi, Rum, Danny, and on that coast, EK is the next out."
(*click*) I'm upset
How, we dealin' with the biggest pandemic in the world, and y'all bringin' up the West now (Nile)?
Check the files! See who all died to me first
For a Budget, I'll stop your Enterprise when it hurts (Hertz)
Addin' you to the list of niggas I killed! Prob'ly the worst!
Bad Boys II, they found ecstasy in corpses
They gon' find E wit' dead niggas when they go through my body of work!
FIRST, it ain't what you say, it's how you say it why you ain't got the looks
That boring-ass flow why we don't wanna watch you cook
If it wasn't for Geechi, Rum, Coffee vouchin' for you, you would not get booked
Be happy you got that C-section, 'cause your delivery is hard to push
The bloggers put up a question, sayin' why I wasn't on Ultimate Madness 1 or 2
I shoulda been all in the picture
It woulda been too easy (Eazy): I spar wit' the killas
Smack knew when the tournament started, Prep would be a problem for all of you niggas
Time!
Of course you right...
Lemme start this next round, nigga - them shorts too tight
Hold on...

Pause, man, pause

I got punches...schemes...quick lines to flame you
This time will change you, I mix styles in tangles
Four bars, then a personal...this why I'm fatal
I know how to tally marks: every fifth line's an angle
Well, I'm not knowin' who to trust, but I'm knowin' you is sus'
Did that Kobe dedication in your battle - cue this up
"He brought us back in the Finals"
Your statement's true as fuck
One question in that lesson, Prep: tell me, who is "us?"
You from Baltimore, Maryland
Stop the loud statements
You a gimmick-havin' nigga usin' death for clout-chasin'
Right hand about-face him, then I let a buck hit you
Show up to the wake just to act like I fuck wit' you
Groupie-ass nigga, emotions, he's performin' 'em
Y'all only claim these West Coast niggas in memoriam
So flowers, I need more of 'em, or shit, just gimme theirs
Knife in your head, Prep - now, we just splittin' hairs
GOAT status, gettin' there, grew up gettin' pies off
Pre-pandemic, we was eatin' off the sidewalk
Read him in the blind dark, and ask a question to you:
That "Prep" name gimmick your idea, or was it Nunu?
'Cause you was dressin' really clever
Smack started starvin' him
But then took off the sweaters, and was never on the card again (cardigan)
And now it's gettin' cold...
Switchin' up your stock
That image had to drop, boy, the business had to stop
Mama said I would change history...I'm livin' through her thoughts
Because now I am the Kennedy that's givin' you the shot!
Bitch, the living proof forgot, E at the top-top
He, gettin' mop-mopped
This, is the hotbox
There's no one at his funeral, Corona, doors get lock-lock
His family gotta watch his fuckin' box drop on Dropbox!
His death is downloaded!
Your death is downloaded, I might remove the trash
Pitch swift, recoup the bag
I'm just tryna 'ccrue a stash
Seein' red 'til the bread is what Lux and Tsu just had
Grinding's in my genes (jeans), period...I want it super bad (Superbad)
Boy, I'm cookin' like I do
You switched your look from shy to cool
Thought that prep look would get looks, but took you out the loops
Now that bow ties in your battles are just lookin' like a noose
There's Uncle Tom-min' in your stylin', Prep, a spot that you neglect
What type of nigga wears a sweater and ties a knot around his neck?
And you ain't spottin' disrespect?
That karma's really deadly
Your heart is bein' emptied, but your karma's really trembly
You dress like a house slave all the time...but callin' me a preppie
And that's flattery - I'd rather be a Carlton than Geoffrey
'Cause we both was in the mansion, and set the tone with laughter
But I'm the one that's labeled a nerd, but he calls everyone a "Master"
Bitch, that's what I'm disaster
Gems I am givin' you...
Gems I am givin' you
And this the last time you had witnessed a miracle
Aye, Cor', I been watchin' y'all for years, but this what y'all taught me, bruh
I'm tired of these pro-Black activist hypocrite niggas
Y'all be blowin' my mind
Breonna Taylor killers still free
You wanna protest, but won't even ride
Man, they won't get a trial!
No hearing, for the death (deaf)
And all you wanna do is hold up a sign!
I won't even lie, I did my homework, and it occurred to me
You tweeted, "Don't give 'em a reason to shoot"
You don't know the amount of rage that surged through me
To protect us, to serve us is their duty
But you want me to comply, stand by, while the 12 killin' (h)ours like the Purge movie!
Yours truly want us to be conscious!
They only see convicts, not people!
You tryna open my third eye!? I don't know if I'mma open these two!
Between you and me!? The difference is unlimited
You went to a private school, your dad and your mom rich as shit!
You educated yourself on Black issues in the community
I really had to live in it!
I applaud you for protestin'!
Frontline, some of the realest shit!
But you can't hold up a picket sign when you grew up behind a PICKET FENCE!
This is it! You visited
It was like, one summer, I was 13
I swear it felt like I was just gettin' by
At this point, if I lost somebody else, I prob'ly wouldn't cry
Rest in Peace TJ, D Fresh, Mike Mike, (*kiss*) Lil Fang
Every day of that summer felt like somebody died
Teacher asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up, I said, "Alive!"
You feel the vibes? I need you to focus and listen
I'm a fan of what you do outside of battle rap
Givin' speeches to the kids so they don't go in the system
But I don't really get it
You battled Jey The Nitewing with blonde hair and African clothes
This whole shit is twisted!
One line, you Sharif, the next line, you holdin' a Biscuit
Man, you so CONTRADICTIVE!
You can't wear a Dashiki, creep wit' a tre (Tray), and tell me, "Don't Be a Menace!"
Most of you niggas - you activist niggas - think talkin' gon' get us some justice
Your mind ain't like mine
A cop take our lifeline, first thing you do, put a hashtag on a timeline
Your daddy is Black, your mother is not Black
That's somethin' you try and hide
You cannot be pro-Black and your wife is not Black!
That shit don't give me the right vibes!
I'm all for you bein' a Trailblazer, but every time I look at your Dame, I see your white side (Whiteside)!
What type time you on? Only activist when the law cuff us?
How can you be in love with a race responsible for our shortcomings?
All that Huey Newton shit you preach...and you marry a white bitch?
What's wrong, brother!?
How could a nigga that studied Hue' pick the wrong color!?
Only God judge us!
You went from a ponytail to blonde hair to braids
You change your image a lot
You went from a Christian to Muslim, now you atheist
You change your religion a lot
You don't know what to do with your Faith, like when Biggie saw her in that picture wit' 'Pac!
I had a different stock!
They lost sight of me before
Lost faith in me, too many nights I took a loss
I saw niggas leave SMACK, burn bridges, fight to get back on!
All over politics, we don't like to get involved!
Fans tellin' me I should be higher than where I'm at
I ain't fallin' for that Battle Rap Trap - I'm right (Write) Where I Belong
Time, nigga

This the reason I took this battle, so bear wit' me...
I owe Caffeine a lot...more than URL
See, life had cornered me a cell and Smack afforded me the bail
I'm payin' rent in punchlines, schemin' while I'm dreamin'
Now a Utah nigga...givin' 'em somethin' to believe in
You can make it to SMACK, baby
Anything is possible
And I'm tryna celebrate...'til I learned Twork was in that hospital
I'm hurtin' wit' that obstacle, 'cause that's a bad occurrence
Best performer in our sport, and he still don't have insurance
He got 20 million views, still can't crack the budget
All of that exposure, and they say he lack the coverage
Health is wealth, my kings and queens
The punishment is wrong
I mean, imagine donatin' to a GoFundMe for LeBron
Rappers, that's what we up on, kings get paid like pawns
And I'm not one for makin' excuses, I pray the truth just makes it strong
Progression is a must, but is we vettin' who we trust?
I say sell those fuckin' NOME trailers and make sure Twork was blessed as fuck
But I guess the Caffeine checks is cuffs
You know, the profit is accruin'
And now to these debacles, Avocado ain't included
I know the sponsors won't approve this, but he started a new movement
I know it's right to cut him now, but is it foul wit' how we movin'?
I am grateful for the plates
Caffeine has got me crackin'
It's just a double-edged sword when I see the skills they lackin'
Me and Holmzie started blackin', elicitin' reaction
Second round, the tech went down, I'm like, "Don't tell me this is happenin'
All the money on this matchin', please don't do this now
Did we truly lose the sound?"
"EK, please recoup the round"
In all that stressin', I had a question...
I know it's rude to do this now
But why the fuck ain't Caffeine have to do a Proving Grounds?
See, listen...'cause this is our status quo, but it's not for rappers, though
'Cause with that first Genesis stream, we'd consider that a choke, right?
But they takin' Avo's spot...right?
But they takin' Avo's spot...
Are we just huntin' for the bucks?
And if the money's all that matters, can they pay to replace a Lux?
I mean, that blanket statement's tough, but our banking statements up
But if we chain to all that change, can we refrain from changing us?
And did we forget about Corona, on Avocado roof?
Gave us three months of content, then followed by a boot
Look, I'm acknowledgin' the truth, I'm knowin' when in doubt
But how are judges judgin' streams that are goin' in and out?
And your guess is good as mine...
I'm not throwing you a tantrum
I approve of Caffeine - we just goin' through expansion
Your presence is really needed, I'm knowing you ain't plan this
But this is battle rap, where we are holding you to standards
See, the golden truth is candid, and I'm not gonna fight back
I owe Caffeine a lot, so I'm not runnin' like that
I owe Caffeine for this platform, that wanted my raps
Now, Caffeine, admit to me you owe me 25 racks
Bitch, the gun in my lap! I'm fuckin' wit' ya filler
I am done wit' these bums, now I'm huntin' for a Chilla
Black something gonna peel ya
Bitch, the death can be revealin'
I'll be right here waitin'...if they let me in the building
This about accountability, and I'mma count it on us
And if I ever drop the ball, Smack, please feel free to call me on it
These are gems I am givin' you
Know what we listenin' to
Today's the last time we had witnessed a miracle, nigga

You write movies? Cool...
You movin' up now
Remember I wanted to be in one of your movies?
Told you I'd hit you soon as I touched down?
You let me read a script, didn't call me back...
Tough crowd
Didn't like my audition back then...(*swoo*) let's see if I make the cut now
No crowd, now they can tell who really pennin' it
I'm at him (atom), wit' no gas - you out your element
Whole clip, they gon' think I'm COVID-testin' him
Stick and (in) the nose, just waitin' for somethin' negative!
It's evident I shouldn't even compete wit' this bum
Bet you thought I would come in here and sleep on you, huh?
It's a fire drill: I know you not a threat, but I'mma treat you like one
I need this one, bruh, been too long
What y'all expect?
Used to go crazy before, then it lost respect
Fuck that! Back to postal, like the wrong address
You got kicked out of the tournament! They were all upset!
Even though you been on a run, E knows (runny nose) the coffin (coughin') next
Brought a TEC, brand-new look: it's a makeover
Strap, got it in secure (Insecure): it's a ray (Issa Rae) on it
BANG on him!
All that tweetin' will take your life away
You and that keyboard make me feel some type of way
Long-range, sniper way
Or up close, the rifle spray
DE, AR, 80, K: sound like a license plate!
Might just make...me pull a pistol at him
BAH! BAH! BAH!
Got him feelin' himself, if E go (ego) trippin' again!
This is pretend!
I been through pain, nigga, the worst kind
Geechi said, "When it's real, you can tell - you can see it in his-"
I ain't feelin' this nerd vibe
The look in my eyes wild (Oswald) - that's how Kennedy died the first time!
Hurt mine? That I won't allow you to do
Whole pound I'mma shoot
Go from .50 to .30: it's the Fountain of Youth
I'll hunt him down wit' a deuce
Man, I'll pick up EK wit' the AR like alphabet soup!
That interview you did wit' HipHopIsReal, you told Knowledge I was the PG that inspired your pen
Now it's personal...
They chose my style over E's (ovaries)...
Plus, sent the (placenta) nigga I gave birth to!
Why don't you use your real name? Your Muslim name...Asahd
Yeah, I know more than I should about most you rappers
Your dome gets splattered, by a .9
Nah! MAC (Mac) for Asahd (a side) like a soul food platter
How they, gon' promote you after? This a clean sweep
E light - why y'all put him against elite?
Nigga, we street! And that mean we don't talk
Eagles, Hawks, the birds (Byrds) dirty: Ozark!
I hit him from a mile away, the chrome spark
New scope, lock on E side (Eastside): Joe Clark!
It's yo' fault...why your mother daughter gettin' two from the 'K
If this erase sis' (racist), it'll Ruin Your Day!
You dug your grave
They seen you die and ain't know how, nigga
But fuck that moment of silence - I'm a Loud nigga
Loud, man



Even in the quietest moments
I wish I knew
What I had to do
And even though the sun is shining
Well I feel the rain -- here it comes again, dear
And even when you showed me
My heart was out of tune
For there's a shadow of doubt
That's not letting me find you too soon
The music that you gave me
The language of my soul
Oh Lord, I want to be with you
Won't you let me come in from the cold?
Don't you let the sun fade away
Don't you let the sun fade away
Don't you let the sun be leaving
Won't you come to me soon?
And even though the stars are listening
And the ocean's deep
I just go to sleep
And then I create a silent movie
You become the star
Is that what you are, dear?
Your whisper tells a secret
Your laughter brings me joy
And a wonder of feeling
I'm nature's own little boy
But still the tears keep falling
They're raining from the sky
Well there's a lot of me got
To go under before I get high
Don't you let the sun disappear
Don't you let the sun disappear
Don't you let the sun be leaving
No, you can't be leaving my life
Say that you won't be leaving my life
Say that you won't be leaving my life
Say won't you please, stay won't you please
Say won't you please, stay won't you please
Lord, won't you come and get into my life
Lord, won't you come and get into my life
Say won't you please, stay won't you please
Stay won't you please, say won't you please
Oh Lord, don't go
Won't you come to me?
And even when the song is over
Where have I been -- was it just a dream?
And though your door is always open
Where do I begin -- may I please come in, dear?



Happy, and I'm smiling
Walk a mile to drink your water
You know I'd love to love you
And above you there's no other
We'll go walking out
While others shout of war's disa(aa)ster
Oh, we won't give in
Let's go living in the past
Once I'd used to join in
Every boy an' girl was my friend
Now there's revolution
But they don't know what they're fighting
Let us close our eyes
Outside their lives go on much fa(aa)ster
Oh, we won't give in
We'll keep living in the past

Once I'd used to join in

And if it's bad
Don't let it get you down, you can take it
And if it hurts
Don't let them see you cry, you can make it

Hold your head up, woman
Hold your head up, woman
Hold your head up, woman
Hold your head high
Hold your head up, woman
Hold your head up, woman
Hold your head up, woman
Hold your head high


And if they stare
Just let them burn their eyes on you moving
And if they shout
Don't let it change a thing that you're doing
Hold your head up, woman

Hold your head up, woman
Hold your head high

Don't let it change a thing that you're doing

Hold your head up
Hold your head up
Hold your head up
Hold your head up
Hold your head up
Hold your head up
Hold your head up



You, who are on the road
Must have a code
That you can live by
And so
Become yourself
Because the past
Is just a good-bye

Teach your children well
Your father's hell did slowly go by
And feed them on your dreams
The one they picked
The one you'll know by

Don't you ever ask them why
If they told you, you would cry
So just look at them and sigh
And know they love you

And you of tender years (Can you hear and do you care)
Can't know the fears (And can you see)
That your elders grew by (We must be free)
And so please help (To teach your children)
Them with your youth (What you believe in)
They seek the truth (Make a world)
Before they can die (That we can live in)
Teach your parents well
The children's hell
Will slowly go by
And feed them on your dreams
The one they picked
The one you'll know by

Don't you ever ask them why
If they told you, you would cry
So just look at them and sigh
And know they love you



Look up on the wall
There on the floor
Under the pillow
Behind the door
There's a crack in the mirror
Somewhere there's a hole in a window-pane
Now do you think I'm to blame
Tell me do you think I'm to blame

(When they do it) you're never there
(When they show it) you stop and stare
(Abacab) isn't anywhere
(Abacab)

If you're wrappin'
Up the world
Cause you've taken
Someone else's girl
When they turn on the pillow
Even when they answer the telephone
Don't you think they'll find out
Tell me don't you think they'll find out
(When they do it) you're never there
(When they show it) you stop and stare
(Abacab) isn't anywhere
(Abacab) doesn't really care

You want it, you've got it, you've gotta go
You want it, you've got it, now you know

It's an illusion
It's a game
A reflection
Of someone else's name
When you wake in the morning
Wake and find you're covered in cellophane
Well there's a hole in there somewhere
Yeah there's a hole in there somewhere
Baby there's a hole in there somewhere
Now there's a hole in there somewhere

(When they do it) you're never there
(When they show it) you stop and stare
(Abacab) isn't anywhere
(Abacab)



I've been around the world
I've seen a million girls
Ain't one of them got
What, my lady, she's got
She's stealin' the spotlight
Knocks me off my feet
She's enough to start a landslide
Just a-walking down the street

Wearing dresses so tight
And looking dynamite
About to blow me out
No doubt about it, can't live without it

The girl's got rhythm (Girl's got rhythm)
The girl's got rhythm (Girl's got rhythm)
She's got the backseat rhythm (Backseat rhythm)
The girl's got rhythm

She's like a lethal brand
Too much for any man
She give me first degree
She really satisfied me
Love me till I'm legless
Aching and sore
Enough to stop a freight train
Or start the Third World War
You know I'm losing sleep
But I'm in too deep
Like a body needs blood
No doubt about it, can't live without it

The girl's got rhythm (Girl's got rhythm)
The girl's got rhythm (Girl's got rhythm)
She's got the backseat rhythm (Backseat rhythm)
The girl's got rhythm

You know she move like sin
And when she let me in
It's like liquid love
No doubt about it, can't live without it

The girl's got rhythm (Girl's got rhythm)
The girl's got rhythm (Girl's got rhythm)
She's got the backseat rhythm (Backseat rhythm)
The girl's got rhythm
You know she really got the rhythm (Girl's got rhythm)
She's got the backseat rhythm (Backseat rhythm)
Rock 'n' roll rhythm (Rock 'n' roll rhythm)
The girl's got rhythm



Got brass in pocket
Got bottle, I'm gonna use it
Intention, I feel inventive

Gonna make you, make you
Make you notice

Got motion, restrained emotion
Been driving, Detroit leaning
No reason, just seems so pleasing

Gonna make you, make you
Make you notice

Gonna use my arms
Gonna use my legs
Gonna use my style
Gonna use my sidestep
Gonna use my fingers
Gonna use my, my, my imagination
'Cause I'm gonna make you see
There's nobody else here, no one like me
I'm special (Special), so special (Special)
I gotta have some of your attention, give it to me

Got rhythm, I can't miss a beat
Got new skank, it's so reet
Got something I'm winking at you

Gonna make you, make you
Make you notice

Gonna use my arms
Gonna use my legs
Gonna use my style
Gonna use my sidestep
Gonna use my fingers
Gonna use my, my, my imagination

'Cause I'm gonna make you see
There's nobody else here, no one like me
I'm special (Special), so special (Special)
I gotta have some of your attention, give it to me
'Cause I'm gonna make you see
There's nobody else here, no one like me
I'm special (Special), so special (Special)
I gotta have some of your attention, give it to me

Ohh
And when you walk



I heard the men saying something
The captains tell they pay you well
And they say they need sailing men to
Show the way, and leave today
Was it you that said
"How long, how long?"
They say the sea turns so dark that
You know it's time, you see the sign
They say the point Demons Guard is
An ocean grave, for all the brave
Was it you that said
"How long, how long
How long to the point of know return?"
Your father, he said he needs you
Your mother, she says she loves you
Your brothers, they echo your words:
"How far to the point of know return?"
"Well, how long?"
Today I found a message floating
In the sea from you to me
You wrote that when you could see it
You cried with fear, the Point was near
Was it you that said
"How long, how long
To the Point of Know Return?"



Out in the street, it's 6 am
Another sleepless night
Three cups of coffee, but I can't clear my head
From what went down last night
I know we both have our own little ways
But somehow we keep it together
You hear me talk, but you don't hear what I say
I guess it don't even matter

Blue morning, blue day, won't you see things my way?
Blue morning, can't you see what your love has done to me?

I've always listened to your point of view, my ways I tried to mend
And I've always been a patient man, but my patience has reached its end
You tell me you're leaving, you tell me goodbye
You say you might send a letter
Well honey don't telephone, cause I won't be alone
I need someone to make me feel better
 

Blue morning, blue morning 
Blue, blue, blue day



I remember the thirty-five sweet goodbyes
When you put me on the Wolverine
Up to Annandale
It was still September
When your daddy was quite surprised
To find you with the working girls
In the county jail
I was smoking with the boys upstairs
When I heard about the whole affair

I said oh no
William and Mary won't do, now
Well I did not think the girl
Could be so cruel
And I'm never going back
To my old school
Oleanders growing outside her door
Soon they're gonna be in bloom
Up in Annandale
I can't stand her
Doing what she did before
Leaving like a gypsy queen
In a fairy tale
Well I hear the whistle but I can't go
I'm gonna take her down to Mexico

She said whoa no
Guadalajara won't do, now
Well I did not think the girl
Could be so cruel
And I'm never going back
To my old school

California tumbles into the sea
That'll be the day I go
Back to Annandale
Tried to warn you
About Chino and Daddy Gee
But I can't seem to get to you
Through the U.S. Mail
Well I hear the whistle but I can't go
I'm gonna take her down to Mexico
She said oh no
Guadalajara won't do, now
Well I did not think the girl
Could be so cruel
And I'm never going back
To my old school



Fat man sitting on a little stool takes the money from my hand
While his eyes take a walk all over you
Hands me the ticket, smiles and whispers good luck with her
Cuddle up, angel, cuddle up, my little dove
We'll ride down, baby, into this tunnel of love
I can feel the soft silk of your blouse
And them soft thrills in our little fun house
Then the lights go out and it's just the three of us
You, me and all that stuff we're so scared of
Gotta ride down, baby, into this tunnel of love
There's a crazy mirror showing us both in 5-D
I’m laughing at you, you’re laughing at me
There’s a room of shadows that gets so dark, brother
It’s easy for two people to lose each other
In this tunnel of love
It ought to be easy, ought to be simple enough
Man meets a woman and they fall in love
But this house is haunted and the ride gets rough
You've got to learn to live with what you can't rise above
If you want to ride on down in through this tunnel of love
Tunnel of love
Tunnel of love
Tunnel of love



Tuesday afternoon
I'm just beginning to see
Now I'm on my way
It doesn't matter to me
Chasing the clouds away
Something calls to me
The trees are drawing me near
I've got to find out why
Those gentle voices I hear
Explain it all with a sigh
I'm looking at myself, reflections of my mind
It's just the kind of day to leave myself behind
So gently swaying through the fairy-land of love
If you'll just come with me and see the beauty of
Tuesday afternoon
Tuesday afternoon
Tuesday afternoon
I'm just beginning to see
Now I'm on my way
It doesn't matter to me
Chasing the clouds away
Something calls to me
The trees are drawing me near
I've got to find out why
Those gentle voices I hear
Explain it all with a sigh



Hey, hey, mama, said the way you move
Gonna make you sweat, gonna make you groove

Hey, hey, baby, when you walk that way
Watch your honey drip, I can't keep away

Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh, oh, oh

Hey baby, oh baby, pretty baby
Tell me would you do me now
Hey baby, oh baby, pretty baby

Take too long 'fore I found out
What people mean by down and out
Spent my money, took my car
Started tellin' her friend she' gon' be a star
I don't know, but I've been told
A big-legged woman ain't got no soul

Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh, oh, oh
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh, oh, oh

All I ask for, all I pray
Steady rollin' woman gonna come my way
Need a woman gonna hold my hand
Won't tell me no lies, make me a happy man

Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ahh


Hey baby,  pretty baby, oh baby
Hey baby,  pretty baby, oh baby
Hey baby,  pretty baby, oh baby

Making believe that you just don't feel the same
Oh Jane

It's a nice day to start again



Love is but a song we sing
Fear's the way we die
You can make the mountains ring
Or make the angels cry
Though the bird is on the wing
And you may not know why

Come on people now
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Try to love one another right now

Some may come and some may go
We will surely pass
When the one that left us here
Returns for us at last
We are but a moment's sunlight
Fading in the grass
Come on people now
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Try to love one another
Right now
Come on people now
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Try to love one another
Right now

Come on people now
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Try to love one another
Right now

If you hear the song I sing
You will understand (listen!)
You hold the key to love and fear
All in your trembling hand
Just one key unlocks them both
It's there at your command

Come on people now
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Try to love one another
Right now
Come on people now
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Try to love one another
Right now
(I said) Come on people now
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Try to love one another
Right now
Right now
Right now



Well you're the real tough cookie with a long history
Of breaking little hearts like the one in me
That's okay, let's see how you do it
Put up your dukes, let's get down to it

Hit me with your best shot
Why don't you hit me with your best shot
Hit me with your best shot
Fire away

You come on with it, come on, you don't fight fair
That's okay, see if I care
Knock me down, it's all in vain
I get right back on my feet again

Hit me with your best shot
Why don't you hit me with your best shot
Hit me with your best shot
Fire away

Well you're the real tough cookie with a long history
Of breaking little hearts like the one in me
Before I put another notch in my lipstick case
You better make sure you put me in my place

Hit me with your best shot
C'mon, hit me with your best shot
Hit me with your best shot
Fire away

Hit me with your best shot
Why don't you hit me with your best shot
Hit me with your best shot
Fire away



I see a red door and I want it painted black
No colours anymore, I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

I see a line of cars and they're all painted black
With flowers and my love, both never to come back
I see people turn their heads and quickly look away
Like a newborn baby, it just happens every day

I look inside myself and see my heart is black
I see my red door, I must have it painted black
Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts
It's not easy facing up when your whole world is black

No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue
I could not foresee this thing happening to you
If I look hard enough into the setting sun
My love will laugh with me before the morning comes

I see a red door and I want it painted black
No colours anymore, I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

I wanna see your face, painted black
Black as night, black as coal
I wanna see the sun blotted out from the sky
I wanna see it painted, painted, painted, painted black
Yeah



I'll be the roundabout
The words will make you out 'n' out
I spent the day your way
Call it morning driving through the sound of
In and out the valley

The music dance and sing
They make the children really ring
I spent the day your way
Call it morning driving through the sound of
In and out the valley

In and around the lake
Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there
One mile over we'll be there and we'll see you
Ten true summers we'll be there and laughing too
Twenty four before my love you'll see
I'll be there with you

I will remember you
Your silhouette will charge the view
Of distant atmosphere
Call it morning driving through the sound of
Even in the valley
In and around the lake
Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there
One mile over we'll be there and we'll see you
Ten true summers we'll be there and laughing too
Twenty four before my love you'll see
I'll be there with you
Along the drifting cloud the eagle searching
Down on the land
Catching the swirling wind the sailor sees
The rim of the land
The eagle's dancing wings create as weather
Spins out of hand
Go closer hold the land feel partly no more
Than grains of sand
We stand to lose all time a thousand answers
By in our hand
Next to your deeper fears we stand
Surrounded by a million years
I'll be the roundabout
The words will make you out 'n' out
I'll be the roundabout
The words will make you out 'n' out
In and around the lake
Mountains come out of the sky, they stand there
Twenty four before my love and I'll be there

I'll be the roundabout
The words will make you out 'n' out
You spent the day your way
Call it morning driving through the sound of
In and out the valley

In and around the lake
Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there
One mile over we'll be there and we'll see you
Ten true summers we'll be there and laughing too
Twenty four before my love you'll see
I'll be there with you



Ever since I was a young boy, I've played the silver ball
From Soho down to Brighton, I must've played 'em all
But I ain't seen nothin' like him in any amusement hall
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball

He stands like a statue, becomes part of the machine
Feelin' all the bumpers, always playin' clean
Plays by intuition, the digit counters fall
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball

He's a pinball wizard, there has to be a twist
A pinball wizard's got such a supple wrist

How do you think he does it? I don't know!
What makes him so good?

Ain't got no distractions, can't hear no buzzes and bells
Don't see no lights a-flashin', plays by sense of smell
Always gets the replay, never seen him fall
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball
I thought I was the Bally table king
But I just handed my pinball crown to him

Even on my favorite table, he can beat my best
His disciples lead him in, and he just does the rest
He's got crazy flipper fingers, never seen him fall
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball



Feeling down 'n' dirty, feeling kinda mean
I've been from one to another extreme
It's time I had a good time, ain't got time to wait
I wanna stick around 'till I can't see straight

Fill my eyes with that double vision
No disguise for that double vision
Ooh, when it gets through to me, it's always new to me
My double vision gets the best of me

Never do more than I, I really need
My mind is racing, but my body's in the lead
Tonight's the night, I'm gonna push it to the limit
I live all of my years in a single minute

Fill my eyes with that double vision
No disguise for that double vision
Ooh, when it gets through to me, it's always new to me
My double vision always seems to get the best of me, the best of me, yeah-eah eah-eah-hey

Oh-ooh (oh) oh-oh, double vision
(Oh) I need double vision
(Oh, double vision) it takes me out of my head, taking me out of my head
(Oh, double vision) I get my double vision, woa-oah
(Oh, double vision) seeing double double, double vision
(Oh, double vision) oh-oh my my double vision
(Oh, double vision) double vision, yeah-ah-ah eah-eah eah-eah ah
(Oh, double vision) I get double vision, oooh
How, how?



We're so sorry, Uncle Albert
We're so sorry if we caused you any pain
We're so sorry, Uncle Albert
But there's no one left at home and I believe I'm gonna rain
We're so sorry but we haven't heard a thing all day
We're so sorry, Uncle Albert
But if anything should happen, we'll be sure to give a ring
We're so sorry Uncle Albert
But we haven't done a bloody thing all day
We're so sorry, Uncle Albert
But the kettle's on the boil, and we're so easily called away
Hands across the water (Water)

Johnny's in the basement, mixin' up the medicine
I'm on the pavement, thinkin' about the government
The man in a trench coat, badge out, laid off
Says he's got a bad cough, wants to get it paid off
Look out kid, it's somethin' you did
God knows when, but you're doin' it again
You better duck down the alleyway, looking for a new friend
The man in the coon-skin cap in a pig pen
Wants 11 dollar bills – you only got 10

Maggie comes fleet foot, face full of black soot
Talkin' that the heat put plants in the bed, but
Phone's tapped anyway
Maggie says the many say
They must bust in early May
Orders from the D.A
Look out kid, don't matter what you did
Walk on your tip toes, don’t tie no bows
Better stay away from those that carry around a fire hose
Keep a clean nose, watch the plainclothes
You don't need a weather man to know which way the wind blows

Oh, get sick, get well, hang around a ink well
Hang bail, hard to tell if anything is gonna sell
Try hard, get barred, get back, ride rail
Get jailed, jump bail, join the Army if you fail
Look out kid, you're gonna get hit
By losers, cheaters, six-time users
Hanging 'round the theaters
Girl by the whirlpool's looking for a new fool
Don't follow leaders, a-watch the parking meters
Oh, get born, keep warm
Short pants, romance
Learn to dance, get dressed
Get blessed, try to be a success
Please her, please him, buy gifts
Don't steal, don't lift
20 years of schoolin' and they put you on the day shift
Look out kid, they keep it all hid
Better jump down a manhole, light yourself a candle
Don't wear sandals, try to avoid the scandals
Don't want to be a bum, you better chew gum
The pump don't work 'cause the vandals took the handles



One, two, three, four
One, two...  (One, two, three, four)

Got a wife and kids in Baltimore, Jack
I went out for a ride and I never went back
Like a river that don't know where it's flowing
I took a wrong turn and I just kept going

Everybody's got a hungry heart
Everybody's got a hungry heart
Lay down your money and you play your part
Everybody's got a hungry heart

I met her in a Kingstown bar
We fell in love I knew it had to end
We took what we had and we ripped it apart
Now here I am down in Kingstown again

Everybody's got a hungry heart
Everybody's got a hungry heart
Lay down your money and you play your part
Everybody's got a hungry heart

Everybody needs a place to rest

Lay down your money and you play your part
Everybody's got a hungry heart

Good friend of mine saw you leavin' by your back door

I need to know (I need to know)

If you think you're gonna leave, then you better say so
I need to know (I need to know)

Been dazed and confused for so long it's not true
Wanted a woman, never bargained for you
Lots of people talk and few of them know
Soul of a woman was created below, yeah

You hurt and abuse telling all of your lies
Run 'round, sweet baby, Lord, how they hypnotize
Sweet little baby, I don't know where you've been
Gonna love you, baby, here I come again

If you're going to San Francisco
Be sure to wear some flowers in your hair
If you're going to San Francisco
You're gonna meet a lot of gentle people there

Every day I work so hard bringing home my hard earned pay
Try to love you, baby, but you push me away
Don't know where you're going, only know just where you've been
Sweet little baby, I want you again


Been dazed and confused for so long it's not true
Wanted a woman, never bargained for you
Take it easy, baby, let them say what they will
Tongue wag so much when I send you the bill



Oh, keep your eyes on the road, your hands upon the wheel
Keep your eyes on the road, your hands upon the wheel
Yeah, we're going to the Roadhouse
Gonna have a real
A good time

Yeah, the back of the Roadhouse they got some bungalows
Yeah, the back of the Roadhouse they got some bungalows
And that's for the people who like to go down slow

The future's uncertain and the end is always near

Let it roll, baby, roll

Let it roll, baby, roll
Let it roll
All night long



Once upon a time
Once when you were mine
I remember skies
Reflected in your eyes

I wonder where you are
I wonder if you think about me
Once upon a time
In your wildest dreams

Once the world was new
Our bodies felt the morning dew
That greets the brand-new day
We couldn't tear ourselves away

I wonder if you care
I wonder if you still remember
Once upon a time
In your wildest dreams

And when the music plays
And when the words are touched with sorrow
When the music plays
I hear the sound I had to follow
Once upon a time
Once beneath the stars
The universe was ours
Love was all we knew
And all I knew was you

I wonder if you know
I wonder if you think about it
Once upon a time
In your wildest dreams


And when the music plays
And when the words are touched with sorrow
When the music plays
And when the music plays
I hear the sound I had to follow
Once upon a time

Once upon a time
Once when you were mine
I remember skies
Mirrored in your eyes
I wonder where you are
I wonder if you think about me
Once upon a time
In your wildest dreams

In your wildest dreams
In your wildest dreams
In your wildest dreams



And now I know
"Spanish Harlem" are not just pretty words to say
I thought I knew
But now I know that rose trees never grow
In New York City

Until you've seen this trash can dream come true
You stand at the edge while people run you through
And I thank the Lord there's people out there like you
I thank the Lord there's people out there like you

While Mona Lisas and mad hatters
Sons of bankers, sons of lawyers
Turn around and say, "Good morning" to the night
For unless they see the sky
But they can't, and that is why
They know not if it's dark outside or light

This Broadway's got
It's got a lot of songs to sing
If I knew the tunes, I might join in
I'd go my way alone
I'd grow my own, my own seeds shall be sown in New York City
Subway's no way for a good man to go down
Rich man can ride, and the hobo, he can drown
And I thank the Lord for the people I have found
I thank the Lord for the people I have found

While Mona Lisas and mad hatters
Sons of bankers, sons of lawyers
Turn around and say, "Good morning" to the night
For unless they see the sky
But they can't, and that is why
They know not if it's dark outside or light

And now I know
"Spanish Harlem" are not just pretty words to say
I thought I knew
But now I know that rose trees never grow
In New York City

Subway's no way for a good man to go down
Rich man can ride, and the hobo, he can drown
And I thank the Lord for the people I have found
I thank the Lord for the people I have found
While Mona Lisas and mad hatters
Sons of bankers, sons of lawyers
Turn around and say, "Good morning" to the night
For unless they see the sky
But they can't, and that is why
They know not if it's dark outside or light

They know not if it's dark outside or light



I'll never be your beast of burden
My back is broad, but it's a-hurting
All I want, for you to make love to me
I'll never be your beast of burden
I've walked for miles, my feet are hurting
All I want is for you to make love to me

Am I hard enough?
Am I rough enough?
Am I rich enough?
I'm not too blind to see

I'll never be your beast of burden
So let's go home and draw the curtains
Music on the radio
Come on, baby, make sweet love to me

Am I hard enough?
Am I rough enough?
Am I rich enough?

Oh, little sister
Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty girls
You're a pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty girl
Pretty, pretty, such a pretty, pretty, pretty girl
Come on, baby, please, please, please

I'll tell you, you can put me out on the street
Put me out with no shoes on my feet
But put me out, put me out
Put me out of misery, yeah
All your sickness, I can suck it up
Throw it all at me, I can shrug it off
There's one thing, baby, I don't understand
You keep on telling me I ain't your kind of man

Ain't I rough enough? Ooh, honey
Ain't I tough enough?
Ain't I rich enough? In love enough?
Ooh, please

I'll never be your beast of burden
I'll never be your beast of burden
Never, never, never, never, never, never, never be
I'll never be your beast of burden
I've walked for miles, my feet are hurting
All I want is you to make love to me, yeah
I don't need no beast of burden
I need no fussing, I need no nursing
Never, never, never, never, never, never, never be



I saw him dancing' there by the record machine
I knew he must've been about seventeen
The beat was going' strong
Playin' my favorite song
An' I could tell it wouldn't be long
Till he was with me, yeah me
An' I could tell it wouldn't be long
Till he was with me, yeah me, singing'

So put another dime in the jukebox, baby
I love rock n' roll
So come an' take your time an' dance with me
He smiled so I got up and asked for his name
That don't matter, he said
'Cause it's all the same
Said 'Can I take you home where we can be alone?'
An' next we were moving' on
He was with me, yeah me
Next we were moving' on
He was with me, yeah me, singing'

Get yourself a cooler, lay yourself low
Coincidental murder, with nothing to show
With the judge, constipation will go to his head
And his wife's aggravation, you're soon enough dead

It's the same old story, same old song and dance, my friend
It's the same old story, same old song and dance, my friend

Gotcha with the cocaine they found with your gun
No smooth-face lawyer to get you undone
Say love ain't the same on the south side of town
You could look, but you ain't gonna find it around

It's the same old story, same old song and dance, my friend (Uh)
It's the same old story, same old story, same old song and dance


Fate comes a-knocking, doors start locking
Your old time connection, change your direction
You ain't gonna change it, can't rearrange it
Can't stand the pain when it's all the same to you, my friend

When you're low down and dirty, from walking the street
With your old hurdy-gurdy, no one to meet
Say love ain't the same, on the south side of town
You could look, but you ain't gonna find it around

It's the same old story, same old song and dance, my friend
It's the same old story, same old story, same old song and dance, yeah



In the beginning, I believed every word that you said
Now that you're gone my world is in shreds
Oh, you loved me and left me
You took all the things that I needed so bad
I'm standing here wondering where is the love that I had?
Oh, give me silver, blue and gold
The colour of the sky I'm told
My ray-ay-ain-bow is overdue
In the beginning, yeah
There was something of love that was mine
Now that it's gone, whoa, I'm cryin'
Oh, the time that it takes for a love
To grow cold is a wonder to me
I'm walkin' around with my head
Hangin' down, tell me where is she?
Give me silver, blue and gold
The colour of the sky I'm told
My ray-ay-ain-bow is overdue
Don't forsake me 'cause I love you
Don't forsake me 'cause I love you
Give me silver, blue and gold
The colour of the sky I'm told
My ray-ay-ain-bow is overdue
Give me silver, blue and gold
The colour of the sky I'm told
My ray-ay-ain-bow is overdue
Now, give me silver, blue and gold
The colour of the sky I'm told
My ray-ay-ain-bow is overdue, yeah
Oh, don't forsake me 'cause I love you
Don't forsake me 'cause I love you, yeah



If I had a mind to
I wouldn't want to think like you
And if I had time to
I wouldn't want to talk to you

I don't care
What you do
I wouldn't want to be like you

If I was high class
I wouldn't need a buck to pass
And if I was a fall guy
I wouldn't need no alibi...

I don't care
What you do
I wouldn't want to be like you

Back on the bottom line
Diggin' for a lousy dime
If I hit a mother lode
I'd cover anything that showed
I don't care
What you do
I wouldn't want to be like you

I don't care
What you do
I wouldn't wanna...
I wouldn't want to be like you
I wouldn't want to be like you



Winter is here again, oh lord
Haven't been home in a year or more
I hope she holds on a little longer
Sent a letter on a long summer day
Made of silver, not of clay
Ooh, I've been running down this dusty road

Ooh, the wheel in the sky keeps on turning
I don't know where I'll be tomorrow
Wheel in the sky keeps on turning
I've been trying to make it home
Got to make it before too long
Ooh, I can't take this very much longer, no
I'm standing in the sleet and rain
Don't think I'm ever gonna make it home again
The morning sun is rising
It's kissing the day

Ooh, the wheel in the sky keeps on turning
I don't know where I'll be tomorrow
Wheel in the sky keeps on turning
Whoa, whoa, whoa
My, my, my, my, my
For Tomorrow

Oh, the wheel in the sky keeps on turning
Ooh, I don't know where I'll be tomorrow
Wheel in the sky keeps me yearning
Ooh, I don't know, I don't know, whoa

Oh, the wheel in the sky keeps on turning
Ooh, I don't know where I'll be tomorrow
Wheel in the sky keeps on turning
Ooh, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, whoa

Wheel in the sky keeps on turning
Don't know where I'll be tomorrow
Ooh, the wheel in the sky keeps turning
Wheel in the sky keeps on turning

How many times must we tell the tale?
How many times must we fall?
Living in lost memory
You just recalled
Working on the sound of the band
Trying to get the music right
Two go out working
Three stay home at night

That's when she said she was pretending
Like she knew the plan
That's when I knew she was pretending
Pretending to understand
Pretending, pretending
Pretending, pretending

Satisfied but lost in love
Situations change
You're never who you used to think you are
How strange

I get lost in alibis
Sadness cannot prevail
Everybody knows strong love
Can't fail

Don't be pretending about how you feel
Don't be pretending that your love is real
Don't be pretending about how you feel
Don't be pretending that your love is real

Pretending, pretending
Pretending, pretending



If you see something that looks like a star
And it's shooting up out of the ground
And your head is spinning from a loud guitar
And you just can't escape from the sound
Don't worry too much, it'll happen to you
We were children once, playing with toys

And the thing that you're hearing is only the sound
Of the low spark of high-heeled boys

The percentage you're paying is too high priced
While you're living beyond all your means
And the man in the suit has just bought a new car
From the profit he's made on your dreams
But today you just read that the man was shot dead
By a gun that didn't make any noise
But it wasn't the bullet that laid him to rest
Was the low spark of high-heeled boys

If you had just a minute to breathe
And they granted you one final wish
Would you ask for something like another chance?
Or something similar as this?
Don't worry too much it'll happen to you
As sure as your sorrows are joys
And the thing that disturbs you is only the sound
Of the low spark of high-heeled boys

The percentage you're paying is too high priced
While you're living beyond all your means
And the man in the suit has just bought a new car
From the profit he's made on your dreams
But today you just read that the man was shot dead
By a gun that didn't make any noise
But it wasn't the bullet that laid him to rest
Was the low spark of high-heeled boys, high-heeled boys




If I gave you everything that I owned
And asked for nothing in return
Would you do the same for me as I would for you?
Or take me for a ride
And strip me of everything including my pride
But spirit is something that no one destroys
And the sound that I'm hearing is only the sound
Of the low spark of high-heeled boys, heeled boys



I want to live, I want to give
I've been a miner for a heart of gold
It's these expressions I never give

That keep me searchin' for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old
Keep me searchin' for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old


I've been to Hollywood, I've been to Redwood
I crossed the ocean for a heart of gold
I've been in my mind, it's such a fine line

That keeps me searchin' for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old
Keeps me searchin' for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old

Keep me searchin' for a heart of gold
You keep me searchin' and I'm growing old
Keep me searchin' for a heart of gold
I've been a miner for a heart of gold



Well I lived on the outskirts of town
In an eight room farmhouse, baby
When my brothers and friends were around
There was always somethin' doin'
Had me a couple of real nice girlfriends
Stopped by to see me every once in a while
When I think back about those days
All I can do is sit and smile

That's when a sport was a sport
And groovin' was groovin'
And dancin' meant everything
We were young and we were improvin'
Laughin', laughin' with our friends
Holdin' hands meant somethin', baby
Outside the club"Cherry Bomb"
Our hearts were really thumpin'
Say yeah yeah yeah
Say yeah yeah yeah
The winter days they last forever
But the weekends went by so quick
Went ridin' around this little country town
We were goin' nuts, girl, out in the sticks
One night, me with my big mouth
A couple guys had to put me in my place
When I see those guys these days
We just laugh and say do you remember when
That's when a sport was a sport
And groovin' was groovin'
And dancin' meant everything
We were young and we were improvin'
Laughin', laughin' with our friends
Holdin' hands meant somethin', baby
Outside the club"Cherry Bomb"
Our hearts were really thumpin'
Say yeah yeah yeah
Say yeah yeah yeah
Say yeah yeah yeah
Say yeah yeah yeah
Seventeen has turned thirty-five
I'm surprised that we're still livin'
If we've done any wrong
I hope that we're forgiven
Got a few kids of my own
And some days I still don't know what to do
I hope that they're not laughing too loud
When they hear me talkin'
Like this to you

That's when a sport was a sport
And groovin' was groovin'
And dancin' meant everything
We were young and we were improvin'
Laughin', laughin' with our friends
Holdin' hands meant so much, baby
Outside the club"Cherry Bomb"
Our hearts were really thumpin'
Say yeah yeah yeah
Say yeah yeah yeah



It's in the way that you use it
It comes and it goes
It's in the way that you use it
Boy don't you know

And if you lie you will lose it
Feelings will show
So don't you ever abuse it
Don't let it go

Nobody's right until somebody's wrong
Nobody's weak until somebody's strong
No one gets lucky until luck comes along
Nobody's lonely until somebody's gone

It's in the way that you use it
It comes and it goes
It's in the way that you use it
Boy don't you know
It's in the way that you use it
It comes and it goes
It's in the way that you use it
Boy don't you know
And if you lie you will lose it
Feelings will show
So don't you ever abuse it
Don't let it go

I've seen dark skies, never like this
Walked on some thin ice, never like this
I've told you white lies, never like this
Looked into true eyes, never like this

It's in the way that you use it
Boy don't you know
It's in the way that you use it
Boy don't you know



Johnny, take a walk with your sister the moon
Let her pale light in, to fill up your room
You've been living underground, eating from a can
You've been running away from what you don't understand, love

She's slippy, you're sliding down
She'll be there when you hit the ground

It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
She moves in mysterious ways
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
She moves in mysterious ways, oh

Johnny, take a dive with your sister in the rain
Let her talk about the things you can't explain
To touch is to heal, to hurt is to steal
If you want to kiss the sky, better learn how to kneel
On your knees, boy!

She's the wave, she turns the tide
She sees the man inside the child
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
She moves in mysterious ways, oh
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
She moves in mysterious ways, oh
It's alright, It's alright, alright
Lift my days, light up my nights, oh

One day you'll look back, and you'll see
Where you were held now by this love
While you could stand there
You could move on this moment
Follow this feeling

It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
She moves in mysterious ways
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
She moves in mysterious ways, oh

Move you, spirits move you
Move, spirits 'its move you, oh yeah
Does it move you?
She moves with it
Lift my days, and light up my nights, oh
We move through miracle days
Spirit moves in mysterious ways
She moves with it
She moves with it
Lift my days, light up my nights



Well, she's fashionably lean
And she's fashionably late
She'll never wreck a scene
She'll never break a date
But she's no drag just watch the way she walks

She's a twentieth century fox
She's a twentieth century fox
No tears, no fears
No ruined years, no clocks
She's a twentieth century fox, oh yeah

She's the queen of cool
And she's the lady who waits
Since her mind left school
It never hesitates
She won't waste time on elementary talk

'Cause she's a twentieth century fox
She's a twentieth century fox
Got the world locked up
Inside a plastic box
She's a twentieth century fox, oh yeah
Twentieth century fox, oh yeah
Twentieth century fox, oh
She's a twentieth century fox



Before you slip into unconsciousness
I'd like to have another kiss
Another flashing chance at bliss
Another kiss, another kiss

The days are bright and filled with pain
Enclose me in your gentle rain
The time you ran was too insane
We'll meet again, we'll meet again

Oh, tell me where your freedom lies
The streets are fields that never die
Deliver me from reasons why
You'd rather cry, I'd rather fly

The crystal ship is being filled
A thousand girls, a thousand thrills
A million ways to spend your time
When we get back, I'll drop a line



Desperado, why don't you come to your senses
You've been out ridin' fences for so long now
Oh, you're a hard one
I know that you've got your reasons
These things that are pleasin' you
Can hurt you somehow
Don't you draw the queen of diamonds, boy
She'll beat you if she's able
You know the queen of hearts is always your best bet
Now it seems to me, some fine things
Have been laid upon your table
But you only want the ones
That you can't get
Desperado
Oh, you ain't getting no younger
Your pain and your hunger
They're driving you home
And freedom, oh, freedom
Well that's just some people talking
Your prison is walking through this world all alone
Don't your feet get cold in the winter time?
The sky won't snow and the sun won't shine
It's hard to tell the night time from the day
And you're losing all your highs and lows
Ain't it funny how the feeling goes
Away...
Desperado
Why don't you come to your senses?
Come down from your fences, open the gate
It may be rainin', but there's a rainbow above you
You better let somebody love you
(Let somebody love you)
You better let somebody love you
Before it's too late



I went back to Ohio
But my city was gone
There was no train station
There was no downtown
South Howard had disappeared
All my favorite places
My city had been pulled down
Reduced to parking spaces

Ay, oh, way to go, Ohio

Well, I went back to Ohio
But my family was gone
I stood on the back porch
There was nobody home
I was stunned and amazed
My childhood memories
Slowly swirled past
Like the wind through the trees

Ay, oh, way to go, Ohio

I went back to Ohio
But my pretty countryside
Had been paved down the middle
By a government that had no pride
The farms of Ohio
Had been replaced by shopping malls
And Muzak filled the air
From Seneca to Cuyahoga Falls

Said, ay, oh, way to go, Ohio



He's a rebel and a runner
He's a signal turning green
He's a restless young romantic
Wants to run the big machine
He's got a problem with his poisons
But you know he'll find a cure
He's cleaning up his systems
To keep his nature pure

Learning to match the beat of the Old World Man
Learning to catch the heat of the Third World Man

He's got to make his own mistakes
And learn to mend the mess he makes
He's old enough to know what's right
But young enough not to choose it
He's noble enough to win the world
But weak enough to lose it
He's a New World Man

He's a radio receiver
Tuned to factories and farms
He's a writer and a ranger
And a young boy bearing arms
He's got a problem with his power
With weapons on patrol
He's got to walk a fine line
And keep his self-control
Trying to save the day for the Old World Man
Trying to pave the way for the Third World Man

He's not concerned with yesterday
He knows constant change is here today
He's noble enough to know what's right
But weak enough not to choose it
He's wise enough to win the world
But fool enough to lose it
He's a New World Man

Learning to match the beat of the Old World Man
He's learning to catch the heat of the Third World Man
He's a New World Man 



Lately, I've been running on faith
What else can a poor boy do?
But my world will be right
When love comes over you
Lately, I've been talking in my sleep
I can't imagine what I have to say
Except my world will be right
When love comes back your way
I've always been one to take each and every day
Seems like by now I'd find a love who'd care just for me
And we go running on faith
All of our dreams will come true
And our world will be right
When love comes over me and you
I've always been one to take each and every day
Seems like by now I'd find a love who cares just for me
Then we'd go running on faith
All of our dreams would come true
And our world will be right
When love comes over me and you
When love comes over you
Said when love comes over you
Love comes over you
Love comes over you
All of our dreams will come true
Love comes over you
Love comes over you
All of our dreams will come true
I said when love comes over you
All of our dreams will
All of our dreams will come true
When love comes over you
All of our dreams will come true
Love comes over you
Love comes over you
Love comes over you



Lunatic fringe
I know you're out there
You're in hiding
And you hold your meetings
I can hear you coming
I know what you're after
We're wise to you this time (wise to you this time)
We won't let you kill the laughter
Lunatic fringe
In the twilight's last gleaming
But this is open season
But you won't get too far
Cause you've got to blame someone
For your own confusion
We're on guard this time (on guard this time)
Against your final solution
We can hear you coming (we can hear you coming)
No, you're not going to win this time (not gonna win)
We can hear the footsteps (we can hear the footsteps)
Hey, out along the walkway (out along the walkway)
Lunatic fringe
We all know you're out there
Can you feel the resistance
Can you feel the thunder



Strange brew
Kill what's inside of you

She's a witch of trouble in electric blue
In her own mad mind she's in love with you
With you
Now, what you gonna do?

Strange brew
Kill what's inside of you

She's some kind of demon messin' in the glue
If you don't watch out it'll stick to you
To you
What kind of fool are you?

Strange brew
Kill what's inside of you

On a boat in the middle of a raging sea
She would make a scene for it all to be
Ignored
And wouldn't you be bored?

Strange brew
Kill what's inside of you

Strange brew
Strange brew
Strange brew
Strange brew

Strange brew
Kill what's inside of you

Ogni giorno passa
Vicino al collasso
Ma ok, va tutto ok

Mi sento perso ma senza di te
Ancora penso, tu ancora pensi
A cosa faresti se fossi con me
P-Prada sul suitcase tax free
Soldi piegati nei jeans
Spendo 1k D&G
Inattivo una J inattivo una X (x2)



When I look back, boy, I must have been green
Bopping in the country, fishing in a stream
Looking for an answer, trying to find a sign
Until I saw your city lights, honey, I was blind

They said, get back, honky cat
Better get back to the woods
But, I quit those days and my redneck ways
And, oh, change is gonna do me good
You better get back, honky cat
Living in the city ain't where it's at
It's like trying to find gold in a silver mine
It's like trying to drink whisky, oh, from a bottle of wine

Well, I read some books and I read some magazines
About those high-class ladies down in New Orleans
And all the fools back home, well, said I was a fool
They said, oh, "Believe in the Lord" is the golden rule

They said, get back, honky cat
Better get back to the woods
But I quit those days and my redneck ways
And, ooh, oh, change is gonna do me good
(Ooh, baby)
They said, get back, honky cat
Better get back to the woods
Well, I quit those days and my redneck ways
And, oh, oh, change is gonna do me good
They said, stay at home, boy, you gotta tend the farm
Living in the city, boy, is, is gonna break your heart
But how can you stay when your heart says no
Ha, how can you stop when your feet say go

You better get back, honky cat
Better get back to the woods
Well, I quit those days and my redneck ways
And, ooh, oh, the change is gonna do me good
You better get back, honky cat
Living in the city ain't where it's at
It's like trying to find gold in a silver mine
It's like trying to drink whisky, oh, from a bottle of wine

Oh yeah, get back, honky cat
Get back, honky cat, get back, whoo
Get back, honky cat
Get back, honky cat, get back, whoo
Oh, get back, honky cat, get back
Get back, honky cat, whoo
Oh yeah, redneck ways and
Whoo



If you wake up and don't wanna smile
If it takes just a little while
Open your eyes and look at the day
You'll see things in a different way

Don't stop thinking about tomorrow
Don't stop, it'll soon be here
It'll be better than before
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone

Why not think about times to come
And not about the things that you've done?
If your life was bad to you
Just think what tomorrow will do

Don't stop thinking about tomorrow
Don't stop, it'll soon be here
It'll be better than before
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone

All I want is to see you smile
If it takes just a little while
I know you don't believe that it's true
I never meant any harm to you
Don't stop thinking about tomorrow
Don't stop, it'll soon be here
It'll be better than before
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone
Don't stop thinking about tomorrow
Don't stop, it'll soon be here
It'll be better than before
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone

Ooh, don't you look back
Ooh, don't you look back
Ooh, don't you look back
Ooh, don't you look back



When the lights go down in the City
And the sun shines on the bay
Ooh, I wanna be there in my City, oh
Oh, oh, oh

So you think you're lonely
Well, my friend, I'm lonely too
I want to get back to my City by the bay
Oh, oh, oh

It's sad, oh, there's been mornings out on the road without you
Without your charms
Ooh, my, my, my, my, my, my
Oh, oh, oh

When the lights go down in the City
And the sun shines on the bay
Ooh, I wanna be there in my City, oh
Oh, oh, oh

When the lights go down in the City
And the sun shines on the bay
Ooh, I wanna be there in my City, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Mmm
Oh, oh, oh



A hot summer night fell like a net
I've gotta find my baby yet
I need you to soothe my head
Turn my blue heart to red
Doctor Doctor, gimme the news I got a
Bad case of lovin' you
No pill's gonna cure my ill I've got a
Bad case of lovin' you
A pretty face don't make no pretty heart
I learned that buddy from the start
You think I'm cute, a little bit shy
Mama, I ain't that kind of guy
Doctor Doctor, gimme the news I got a
Bad case of lovin' you
No pill's gonna cure my ill I got a
Bad case of lovin' you
I know you like it, you like it on top
Tell me mama, are you gonna stop?
You had me down twenty-one to zip
Smile of Judas on your lip
Shake my fist, knock on wood
I've got it bad, and I got it good
Doctor Doctor, gimme the news I've got a
Bad case of lovin' you
No pill's gonna cure my ill I got a
Bad case of lovin' you



He take a thunder from the mountain
He take a lightnin' from the sky
He bring a strong man to his beggin' knee
He make the young girl's mama cry

You got to hidey-hide
You got to jump and run
You got to hidey-hidey-hide
The old man is down the road

He got the voices speak in riddles
He got the eye as black as coal
He got a suitcase covered with rattlesnake hide
And he stands right in the road

You got to hidey-hide
You got to jump up, run away
You got to hidey-hidey-hide
The old man is down the road

He make the river call your lover
He make the barkin' of the hound
Put a shadow 'cross the window
When the old man comes around

You got to hidey-hide
You got to jump and run again
You got to hidey-hidey-hide
The old man is down the road
The old man is down the road

Ah, you got to, you got to, you got to hidey-hidey-hide



I'm dreaming tonight, I'm living back home
Right!
Yeah yeah

Take me back to a south Tallahassee
Down cross the bridge to my sweet sassafrassy
Can't stand up on my feet in the city
Got to get back to the real nitty gritty

Yes sir, no sir
Don't come close to my
Home sweet home
Can't catch no dose
Of my hot tail poon tang sweetheart
Sweathog ready to make a silk purse
From a J Paul Getty and his ear
With her face in her beer

Home sweet home

Get out in the field
Put the mule in the stable
Ma she's a cooking
Put the eats on the table
Hate's in the city
And my love's in the meadow
Hands on the plow
And my feets in the ghetto
Stand up, sit down
Don't do nothing
It ain't no good when boss man's
Stuffing it down their throats
For paper notes
And their babies cry
While cities lie at their feet
When you're rocking the street

Home sweet home
Mama, take me home sweet home

I was the last child
I'm just a punk in the street
I was the last child
I'm just a punk in the street



We hear you're leaving, that's okay
I thought our little wild time had just begun
I guess you kind of scared yourself, you turn and run
But if you have a change of heart

Rikki, don't lose that number
You don't wanna call nobody else
Send it off in a letter to yourself
Rikki, don't lose that number
It's the only one you own
You might use it if you feel better
When you get home

I have a friend in town, he's heard your name
We can go out driving on Slow Hand Row
We could stay inside and play games, I don't know
And you could have a change of heart
Rikki, don't lose that number
You don't wanna call nobody else
Send it off in a letter to yourself
Rikki, don't lose that number
It's the only one you own
You might use it if you feel better
When you get home

You tell yourself you're not my kind
But you don't even know your mind
And you could have a change of heart

Rikki, don't lose that number
You don't wanna call nobody else
Send it off in a letter to yourself
Rikki, don't lose that number
It's the only one you own
You might use it if you feel better
When you get home
Rikki, don't lose that number
(Rikki, don't lose that number)
Rikki, don't lose that number



Quite some time, I been sittin' it out
Didn't take no chances, I was a prisoner of doubt
I knocked down the wailin' wall, ain't no sin
Got the feel of fortune, deal me in
Comin' straight on for you
You made my mind
Now I'm stronger, now I'm comin' through
Straight on, straight on for you
Straight on for you
Now I know I got to play my hand
What the winner don't know, a gambler understands
My heart keeps playin' it through with you, my friend
I'll take my chances on you again and again, again
Comin' straight on for you
You made my mind
Now I'm stronger, now I'm comin' through
Straight on, straight on for you
Straight on for you
Comin' straight on for you
You made my mind
And now I'm stronger, now I'm comin' through
Straight on, straight on for you
Straight on, straight on
Straight on for you
Straight on for you
You made my mind
Now I'm stronger, now I'm comin' through
Straight on, straight on for you
Straight on, straight on
I'm straight on for you
Straight on for you



Seagull, you fly across the horizon
Into the misty morning sun
Nobody asks you where you are going
Nobody knows where you're from
Here is a man asking the question

Young hearts can go their way
Can't put it off another day
I don't care what others say
They think we don't listen anyway
Time has come today
(Hey)
Oh
The rules have changed today (Hey)
I have no place to stay (Hey)
I'm thinking about the subway (Hey)
My love has flown away (Hey)
My tears have come and gone (Hey)
Oh, my Lord, I have to roam (Hey)
I have no home (Hey)
I have no home (Hey)

Now the time has come (Time)
There's no place to run (Time)
I might get burned up by the sun (Time)
But I had my fun (Time)
I've been loved and put aside (Time)
I've been crushed by a tumbling tide (Time)
And my soul has been psychedelicized (Time)
Now the time has come (Time)
There are things to realize (Time)
Time has come today (Time)
Time has come today (Time)

Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

This old engine
Makes it on time
Leaves Central Station
About a quarter to nine
Hits river junction
At seventeen to
At a quarter to ten
You know it's traveling again

Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

Trouble ahead
A lady in red
Take my advice
You'd be better off dead
Switch-man sleeping
Train hundred and two
Is on the wrong track
And headed for you
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

Trouble with you is
The trouble with me
Got two good eyes
But we still don't see
Come round the bend
You know it's the end
The fireman screams and
The engine just gleams

Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind
And you know that notion
Just crossed my mind



Here I am again in this mean old town
And you're so far away from me
And where are you when the sun goes down?
You're so far away from me

You're so far away from me
You're so far I just can't see
You're so far away from me
You're so far away from me, alright
I'm tired of being in love and being all alone
When you're so far away from me
I'm tired of making out on the telephone
Cause you're so far away from me

You're so far away from me
You're so far I just can't see
You're so far away from me
You're so far away from me, alright
And I get so tired when I have to explain
When you're so far away from me
See, you've been in the sun, and I've been in the rain
And you're so far away from me
You're so far away from me
You're so far I just can't see
You're so far away from me
You're so far away from me, take it down
You're so far away from me
(You're so far)
Oh, you're so far away from me
Yeah, you're so far away from me
So far away from me
(You're so far)
And you're so far away from me
So far away from me
(You're so far)
So far away from me
Oh, so far away from me
You're so far away from me
So far away from me
(You're so far)
So far away from me, yeah
So far away from me
(You're so far), right
(You're so far)
You're just so far away from me



You think you're gonna take her away
With your money and your cocaine
You keep thinking that her mind is gonna change
But I know everything is okay

She's gonna listen to her heart
It's gonna tell her what to do
She might need a lot of loving
But she don't need you

You want me to think that I'm being used
You want her to think it's over
You can't see it doesn't matter what you do
Buddy, you don't even know her

She's gonna listen to her heart
It's gonna tell her what to do
She might need a lot of loving
But she don't need you

And you just can't creep up behind her
And you can't understand that she's my girl
She's my girl
Yeah, she's gonna listen to her heart
It's gonna tell her what to do
She might need a lot of loving
But she don't need you



Well, I've got to run to keep from hiding
And I'm bound to keep on riding
And I've got one more silver dollar
But I'm not gonna let 'em catch me, no
Not gonna let 'em catch the midnight rider

I don't own the clothes I'm wearing
And the road goes on forever
And I've got one more silver dollar
But I'm not gonna let 'em catch me, no
Not gonna let 'em catch the midnight rider

I've gone by the point of caring
Some old bed I hope to be sharing
And I've dropped one more silver dollar
But I'm not gonna let them catch me, no
Not gonna let 'em catch the midnight rider

No, I'm not gonna let em catch me, no
Not gonna let them catch the midnight rider
No no no no



Whoo!

Pretty woman walking down the street
Pretty woman, the kind I'd like to meet
Pretty woman, I don't believe you, it must be true
No one could look as good as you
Mercy

Pretty woman, won't you pardon me
Pretty woman, I couldn't help but see
Pretty woman, oh, you look lovely as can be
Are you lonely just like me?

Pretty woman, stop a while
Pretty woman, talk a while
Pretty woman, give your smile to me
Pretty woman, yeah, yeah, yeah
Pretty woman, look my way
Pretty woman, say you'll stay with me
'Cause I need you, need you tonight

Pretty woman, don't walk on by
Pretty woman, don't make me cry
Pretty woman, don't walk away-ay, okay
If that's the way it must be, okay
I guess I'll go on home, it's late
There'll be tomorrow night, but wait
What do I see?
She's walking back to me
Whoa-whoa, pretty woman



{​Instrumental lead}​
It's another tequila sunrise
Starin' slowly 'cross the sky said goodbye
He was just a hired hand
Workin' on the dreams he planned to try
The days go by
Every night when the sun goes down
Just another lonely boy in town
And she's out runnin' 'round
She wasn't just another woman
And I couldn't keep from comin' on
It's been so long
Oh and it's a hollow feelin' when
It comes down to dealin' friends
It never ends
{​Instrumental}​
Take another shot of courage
Wonder why the right words never come
You just get numb
It's another tequila sunrise, this old world
Still looks the same
Another frame, mmm



If you're down and confused
And you don't remember who you're talking to
Concentration slip away
Because your baby is so far away
Well, there's a rose in a fisted glove
And the eagle flies with the dove
And if you can't be with the one you love, honey
Love the one you're with
Love the one you're with
Love the one you're with
Love the one you're with
Don't be angry, don't be sad
And don't sit crying over good times you had
There's a girl right next to you
And she's just waiting for something to do
And there's a rose in a fisted glove
And the eagle flies with the dove
And if you can't be with the one you love, honey
Love the one you're with
Love the one you're with
Love the one you're with

Get it together, make it nice
Ain't gonna need any more advice
And there's a rose in a fisted glove
And the eagle flies with the dove
And if you can't be with the one you love, honey
Love the one you're with
Love the one you're with
Love the one you're with
Love the one you're with
Do-do, do do, do do, do-do

Baby, you can drive my car
Yes, I'm gonna be a star
Baby, you can drive my car

{Intro}
She stood there bright as the sun on that California coast
He was a Midwestern boy on his own
She looked at him with those soft eyes, so innocent and blue
He knew right then he was too far from home
He was too far from home
She took his hand and she led him along that golden beach
They watched the waves tumble over the sand
They drove for miles and miles up those twisting, turning roads
Higher and higher and higher they climbed
And those Hollywood nights
In those Hollywood hills
She was looking so right
In her diamonds and frills
Oh those big city nights
In those high rolling hills
Above all the lights
She had all of her skills
{Bridge}
He'd headed west cause he felt that a change would do him good
See some old friends, good for the soul
She had been born with a face that would let her get her way
He saw that face and he lost all control
He had lost all control
Night after night, day after day, it went on and on
Then came that morning he woke up alone
He spent all night staring down at the lights on LA
Wondering if he could ever go home
And those Hollywood nights
In those Hollywood hills
She was looking so right
It was giving him chills
In those big city nights
In those high rolling hills
Above all the lights
With a passion that kills
In those Hollywood nights
In those Hollywood hills
She was looking so right
In her diamonds and frills
Oh those big city nights
In those high rolling hills
Above all the lights
She had all of her skills
In those Hollywood nights....



Young teacher, the subject
Of schoolgirl fantasy
She wants him so badly
Knows what she wants to be
Inside her there's longing
This girl's an open page
Bookmarking, she's so close now
This girl is half his age

Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me

Her friends are so jealous
You know how bad girls get
Sometimes it's not so easy
To be the teacher's pet
Temptation, frustration
So bad it makes him cry
Wet bus stop, she's waiting
His car is warm and dry
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me

Loose talk in the classroom
To hurt they try and try
Strong words in the staffroom
The accusations fly
It's no use, he sees her
He starts to shake and cough
Just like the old man in
That book by Nabokov

Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me

Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me



It's just the normal noises in here!

Well, it was nearly summer, we sat on your roof
Yeah, we smoked cigarettes, and we stared at the moon
And I showed you stars you never could see
It couldn't have been that easy to forget about me
Baby, time meant nothing, anything seemed real
Yeah, you could kiss like fire, and you made me feel
Like every word you said was meant to be
But it couldn't been that easy to forget about me

Baby, even the losers
Get lucky sometimes
Even the losers
Keep a little bit of pride
They get lucky sometimes


Two cars park on the overpass
Rocks hit the water like broken glass
I shoulda known right then it was too good to last
God, it's such a drag when you're living in the past
Baby, even the losers
Get lucky sometimes
Even the losers
Keep a little bit of pride
They get lucky sometimes
Baby, even the losers
Get lucky sometimes
Even the losers
Keep a little bit of pride
Yeah, they get lucky sometimes

Baby, even the losers
Get lucky sometimes
Even the losers
Get lucky sometimes
Oh, oh, oh, oh!
Even the losers
Get lucky sometimes
Oh, oh!
Oh!
Even the losers
Get lucky sometimes
Baby, even the losers
Get lucky sometimes



If you smile at me, I will understand
Cause that is something everybody everywhere does
In the same language
I can see by your coat, my friend
You're from the other side
There's just one thing I got to know
Can you tell me please, who won?
Say, can I have some of your purple berries?
Yes, I've been eating them for six or seven weeks now
Haven't got sick once
Probably keep us both alive
Wooden ships on the water, very free and easy
Easy, you know the way it's supposed to be
Silver people on the shoreline, let us be
Talkin' 'bout very free and easy
Horror grips us as we watch you die
All we can do is echo your anguished cries
Stare as all human feelings die
We are leaving, you don't need us
Go, take your sister then, by the hand
Lead her away from this foreign land
Far away, where we might laugh again
We are leaving, you don't need us
And it's a fair wind blowin' warm
Out of the south over my shoulder
Guess I'll set a course and go



Time after time
I sit and I wait for your call
I know I'm a fool, but what can I say?
Whatever the price, I'll pay
For you, Madame Blue

Once, long ago
A word from your lips and the world turned around
But somehow you've changed, you're so far away
I long for the past and dream of the days
With you, Madame Blue

Suite Madame Blue
Gaze at your looking glass
You're not a child anymore
Suite Madame Blue
The future is all but past
So dressed in your jewels
You made your own rules
You conquered the world, and more
Heaven's door
Ohhhhhh
Ahhhhhh

America, America, America, America
America, America, America, America
America, America, America, America
America, America, America, America
America, America, America, America
America, America, America, America

Red, white, and blue
Gaze in your looking glass
You're not a child anymore
Red, white, and blue
The future is all but past
So lift up your heart
And make a new start
And lead us away from here



Huh!
I'm outa luck, outa love
Gotta photograph, picture of
Passion killer, you're too much
You're the only one I wanna touch
I see your face every time I dream
On every page, every magazine
So wild and free so far from me
You're all I want, my fantasy
Oh, look what you've done to this rock 'n' roll clown
Oh Oh, look what you've done
Photograph - I don't want your
Photograph - I don't need your
Photograph - All I've got is a photograph
But it's not enough
I'd be your lover, if you were there
Put your hurt on me, if you dare
Such a woman, you got style
You make every man feel like a child
You got some kinda hold on me
You're all wrapped up in mystery
So wild and free so far from me
You're all I want, my fantasy
Oh, Look what you've done to this rock'n'roll clown
Oh Oh, Look what you've done

You've gone straight to my head



Stand up in a clear blue morning
Until you see what can be
Alone in a cold day dawning
Are you still free? Can you be?
When some cold tomorrow finds you
When some sad old dream reminds you
How the endless road unwinds you
While you see a chance take it
Find romance fake it
Because it's all on you
Don't you know by now
No one gives you anything?
And don't you wonder how you keep on moving?
One more day your way, oh your way
When there's no one left to leave you
Even you don't quite believe you
That's when nothing can deceive you
While you see a chance take it
Find romance fake it
Because it's all on you
Stand up in a clear blue morning
Until you see what can be
Alone in a cold day dawning
Are you still free? Can you be?
And that old gray wind is blowing
And there's nothing left worth knowing
And its time you should be going
While you see a chance take it
Find romance fake it
Because it's all on you
While you see a chance take it
Find romance
While you see a chance take it
Find romance
While you see a chance take it
Find romance
While you see a chance take it
Find romance
While you see a chance take it
Find romance
While you see a chance take it
Find romance



And the men who hold high places
Must be the ones who start
To mold a new reality
Closer to the heart
Closer to the heart

The blacksmith and the artist
Reflect it in their art
They forge their creativity
Closer to the heart
Yeah, it's closer to the heart

Philosophers and ploughmen
Each must know his part
To sow a new mentality
Closer to the heart
Yeah, it's closer to the heart
Yeah!  Oh


You can be the captain
And I will draw the chart
Sailing into destiny
Closer to the heart
Closer to the heart
Closer to the heart
Closer to the heart
Closer to the heart
I said closer to the heart
Closer to the heart
Closer to your heart
Closer to your heart



Well, the clock says it's time to close now
I guess I'd better go now
I'd really like to stay here all night
The cars crawl past all stuffed with eyes
Street lights shed their hollow glow
Your brain seems bruised with numb surprise
Still one place to go
Still one place to go

Let me sleep all night in your soul kitchen
Warm my mind near your gentle stove
Turn me out and I'll wander baby
Stumblin' in the neon groves

Well, your fingers weave quick minarets
Speak in secret alphabets
I light another cigarette
Learn to forget, learn to forget
Learn to forget, learn to forget

Let me sleep all night in your soul kitchen
Warm my mind near your gentle stove
Turn me out and I'll wander baby
Stumblin' in the neon groves
Well, the clock says it's time to close now
I know I have to go now
I really want to stay here
All night
All night
All night



Childhood living is easy to do
The things you wanted, I bought them for you
Graceless lady, you know who I am
You know I can't let you slide through my hands

Wild horses couldn't drag me away
Wild, wild horses couldn't drag me away

I watched you suffer a dull, aching pain
Now you decided to show me the same
No sweeping exits or offstage lines
Could make me feel bitter or treat you unkind

Wild horses couldn't drag me away
Wild, wild horses couldn't drag me away

I know I dreamed you a sin and a lie
I have my freedom, but I don't have much time
Faith has been broken, tears must be cried
Let's do some living after we die
Wild horses couldn't drag me away
Wild, wild horses, we'll ride them some day

Wild horses couldn't drag me away
Wild, wild horses, we'll ride them some day



Ride, ride my see-saw
Take this place
On this trip, just for me
Ride, take a free ride
Take my place
Have my seat, it's for free

I worked like a slave for years
Sweat so hard just to end my fears
Not to end my life a poor man
But by now, I know I should have run

Run, run my last race
Take my place
Have this number of mine
Run, run like a fire
Don't you run in
In the lanes, run for time

Left school with a first class pass
Started work, but as second class
School taught one and one is two
But by now, that answer just ain't true
(Ah-ah-ah-ah)
(Ah-ah-ah-ah)
(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
(Ah-ah-ah-ah)
(Ah-ah-ah-ah)
(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)

My world is spinning around
Everything is lost that I found
People run, come ride with me
Let's find another place that's free

Ride, ride my see-saw
Take this place
On this trip, just for me
Ride, take a free ride
Take my place
Have my seat, it's for free

Ride my see-saw
Ride, ride
Ride my see-saw
Ride my see-saw
Ride my see-saw...



Got out of town
On a boat, going to Southern islands
Sailing a reach
Before a following sea
She was making for the trades
On the outside
And the downhill run
To Papeete

Off the wind on this heading lie
The Marquesas
We got eighty feet of the waterline
Nicely making way
In a noisy bar in Avalon, I tried to call you
But on a midnight watch I realized
Why twice you ran away

(I think about)
Think about how many times I have fallen
Spirits are using me, larger voices calling
What heaven brought you and me
Cannot be forgotten
(I've been around the world)
I have been around the world
(Looking)
Looking for that woman-girl
(And I know she knows)
Who knows love can endure
And you know it will

When you see the Southern Cross
For the first time
You understand now why you came this way
Cause the truth you might be running from is so small
But it's as big as the promise
The promise of a coming day

So I'm sailing for tomorrow, my dreams are a dying
And my love is an anchor tied to you
Tied with a silver chain
I have my ship
And all her flags are a flying
She is all that I have left
And music is her name

(I think about)
Think about how many times I have fallen
Spirits are using me, larger voices calling
What heaven brought you and me
Cannot be forgotten
(I've been around the world)
I have been around the world
(Looking)
Looking for that woman-girl
Who knows love can endure
And you know it will
And you know it will
Yes

So we cheated and we lied
And we tested
And we never failed to fail
It was the easiest thing to do
You will survive being bested
Somebody fine
Will come along, make me forget about loving you

In the Southern Cross



{Intro}
On the road for forty days
Last night in Little Rock put me in a haze
Sweet, sweet Connie - doing her act
She had the whole show and that's a natural fact
Up all night with Freddy King
I got to tell you poker's his thing
A-booze 'n ladies keep me right
As long as we can make it to the show tonight
We're an American band
We're an American band
We're coming to your town, we'll help you party it down
We're an American band
{Hook}
Four young chiquitas in Omaha
Was waitin' for the band to return from the show
Feelin' good, feelin' right, it's Saturday night
The hotel detective -- he was out-a-sight
Now, these fine ladies, they had a plan
They was out to meet the boys in the band
They said, "Come on, dudes, let's get it on,"
And we proceeded to tear that hotel down
We're an American band
We're an American band
We're coming to your town, we'll help you party it down
We're an American band
We're an American band
We're an American band
We're coming to your town, we'll help you party it down
We're an American band
{Bridge}
We're an American band
We're an American band
We're coming to your town, we'll help you party it down
We're an American band
We're an American band
We're an American band
We're coming to your town, we'll help you party it down
We're an American band
We're an American Band, Ooo-ooo
We're an American Band, Ooo-ooo
We're an American Band, Ooo-ooo



No time left for you
On my way to better things
No time left for you
I'll find myself some wings
No time left for you
Distant roads are calling me
No time left for you
Mm-da, mm-da, mm-da, mm-da, mm-da

No time for a summer friend
No time for the love you send
Seasons change and so did I
You need not wonder why
You need not wonder why
There's no time left for you
No time left for you

No time left for you
On my way to better things
No time left for you
I found myself some wings
No time left for you
Distant roads are calling me
No time left for you
Mm-day, mm-gay, mm-day, mm-gay, mm-day
No time for a gentle rain
No time for my watch and chain
No time for revolving doors
No time for the killing floor
No time for the killing floor
There's no time left for you
No time left for you

No time for a summer friend
No time for the love you send
Seasons change and so did I
You need not wonder why

Mama's got a squeeze box
She wears on her chest
And when Daddy comes home
He never gets no rest
'Cause she's playing all night
And the music's alright
Mama's got a squeeze box
Daddy never sleeps at night
Well the kids don't eat
And the dog can't sleep
There's no escape from the music
In the whole damn street
'Cause she's playing all night
And the music's alright
Mama's got a squeeze box
Daddy never sleeps at night
She goes in and out and in and out
And in and out and in and out
She's playin' all night and the music's all right
Mama's got a squeeze box
Daddy never sleeps at night
She goes, squeeze me, come on and squeeze me
Come on and tease me like you do
I'm so in love with you
Mama's got a squeeze box
Daddy never sleeps at night
She goes in and out and in and out
And in and out and in and out
'Cause she's playing all night
And the music's alright
Mama's got a squeeze box
Daddy never sleeps at night



When I die and they lay me to rest
Gonna go to the place that's the best
When I lay me down to die
Goin' up to the spirit in the sky

Goin' up to the spirit in the sky
That's where I'm gonna go when I die
When I die and they lay me to rest
I'm gonna go to the place that's the best

Prepare yourself you know it's a must
Gotta have a friend in Jesus
So you know that when you die
He's gonna recommend you
To the spirit in the sky

Gonna recommend you

That's where you're gonna go when you die
When you die and they lay you to rest
You're gonna go to the place that's the best

Never been a sinner, I never sinned

So you know that when I die
He's gonna set me up
With the spirit in the sky

Oh set me up with the spirit in the sky
That's where I'm gonna go when I die
When I die and they lay me to rest
I'm gonna go to the place that's the best
Go to the place that's the best



Fly into the rising sun
Faces, smiling everyone
Yeah, she is a whole new tradition
I feel it in my heart

My woman from Tokyo
She makes me see
My woman from Tokyo
She's so good to me

Talk about her like a Queen
Dancing in a Eastern Dream
Yeah, she makes me feel like a river
That carries me away

My woman from Tokyo
She makes me see
My woman from Tokyo
She's so good to me
But I'm at home and I just don't belong

So far away from the garden we love
She is what moves in the soul of a dove
Soon I shall see just how black was my night
When we're alone in Her City of light
Rising from the neon gloom
Shining like a crazy moon
Yeah, she turns me on like a fire
I get high

My woman from Tokyo
She makes me see
My woman from Tokyo
She's so good to me
My woman from Tokyo
She makes me see
My woman from Tokyo
She's so good to me
My woman from Tokyo
My woman from Tokyo
My woman from Tokyo
My woman from Tokyo
My woman from Tokyo



"We've done four already but now we're steady
And then they went: One, two, three, four"

Singing in the sunshine, laughing in the rain
Hitting on the moonshine, rocking in the grain
Got no time to pack my bags, my foots outside the door
I got a date, I can't be late, for the high hopes hailla ball
Oh ho
Oh yeah

Singing to an ocean, I can hear the ocean's roar (ooh)
Play for free, play for me and play a whole lot more, more! (ooh)
Singing about good things and the sun that lights the day (ooh)
I used to sing on the mountains, has the ocean lost its way?

I don't know
Oh-oh yeah
Na nana na na na na na na na na na na na na
Na nana na na na na na na na na na na na na
Na nana na na na na na na na na na na na na
Na nana na na na na na na na na na na na na
Sitting round singing songs until the night turns into day (ooh)
Used to sing on the mountains, but the mountains washed away
(Ooh)
Now I'm singing all my songs to the girl who won my heart
She is only three years old and it's a real fine way to start

Oh yeah
It sure is fine
I blow my mind
When the tears are going down
Yeah, yeah

Oh, so good!



I can't feel this way much longer expecting to survive
With all these hidden innuendos just waiting to arrive
It's such a wavy midnight and you slip into insane
Electric angel rock and roller, I hear what you're playin'

It's an orangy sky
Always it's some other guy
It's just a broken lullaby
Bye bye love
Bye bye love
Bye bye love
Bye bye love

Substitution, mass confusion, clouds inside your head
Involving all my energies until you visited
With your eyes of porcelain and of blue
They shock me into sense
You think you're so illustrious, you call yourself intense

It's an orangy sky
Always it's some other guy
It's just a broken lullaby
Bye bye love
Bye bye love
Bye bye love
Bye bye love-ov-ov-ove

Substitution, mass confusion, clouds inside your head
Were fogging all my energies until you visited
Oh, with your eyes of porcelain and of blue
They shock me into sense
You think you're so illustrious, you call yourself intense

It's an orangy sky
Always it's some other guy
It's just a broken lullaby
Bye bye love
Bye bye love
Bye bye love
Bye bye love



I got to have a shot
Cause what you got is oh, so sweet
You got to make it hot
Like a boomerang I need a repeat

Gimme all your lovin'
All your hugs and kisses too
Gimme all your lovin'
Don't let up until we're through
You got to whip it up
And hit me like a ton of lead
If I blow my top
Will you let it go to your head?

Gimme all your lovin'
All your hugs and kisses too
Gimme all your lovin'
Don't let up until we're through

You got to move it up
And use it like a screwball would
You got to pack it up
Work it like a new boy should

Gimme all your lovin'
All your hugs and kisses too
Gimme all your lovin'
Don't let up until we're through



City girls just seem to find out early
How to open doors with just a smile
A rich old man
And she won't have to worry
She'll dress up all in lace and go in style

Late at night a big old house gets lonely
I guess every form of refuge has its price
And it breaks her heart to think her love is only
Given to a man with hands as cold as ice

So she tells him she must go out for the evening
To comfort an old friend who's feelin' down
But he knows where she's goin' as she's leavin'
She is headed for the cheatin' side of town
You can't hide your lyin' eyes
And your smile is a thin disguise
I thought by now you'd realize
There ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes

On the other side of town a boy is waiting
With fiery eyes and dreams no-one could steal
She drives on through the night anticipating
Because he makes her feel the way she used to feel
She rushes to his arms
They fall together
She whispers that it's only for awhile
She swears that soon she'll be comin' back forever
She pulls away and leaves him with a smile

You can't hide your lyin' eyes
And your smile is a thin disguise
I thought by now you'd realize
There ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes

She gets up and pours herself a strong one
And stares out at the stars up in the sky
Another night, it's gonna be a long one
She draws the shade and hangs her head to cry

She wonders how it ever got this crazy
She thinks about a boy she knew in school
Did she get tired or did she just get lazy?
She's so far gone she feels just like a fool

My, oh my, you sure know how to arrange things
You set it up so well, so carefully
Ain't it funny how your new life didn't change things
You're still the same old girl you used to be
You can't hide your lyin' eyes
And your smile is a thin disguise
I thought by now you'd realize
There ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes

There ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes
Honey, you can't hide your lyin' eyes



Truckin', got my chips cashed in
Keep truckin', like the do-dah man
Together, more or less in line
Just keep truckin' on

Arrows of neon and flashing marquees out on Main Street
Chicago, New York, Detroit and it's all on the same street
Your typical city involved in a typical daydream
Hang it up and see what tomorrow brings

Dallas, got a soft machine;
Houston, too close to New Orleans;
New York's got the ways and means
But just won't let you be, oh no

Most of the cats that you meet on the streets speak of true love
Most of the time they're sittin' and cryin' at home
One of these days they know they gotta get goin'
Out of the door and down to the street all alone

Truckin', like the do-dah man
Once told me "You've got to play your hand"
Sometimes your cards ain't worth a dime
If you don't lay'em down
Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

What in the world ever became of sweet Jane?
She lost her sparkle, you know she isn't the same
Livin' on reds, vitamin C, and cocaine
All a friend can say is "Ain't it a shame"

Truckin', up to Buffalo
Been thinkin', you got to mellow slow
Takes time to pick a place to go
And just keep truckin' on

Sittin' and starin' out of the hotel window
Got a tip they're gonna kick the door in again
I'd like to get some sleep before I travel
But if you got a warrant, I guess you're gonna come in

Busted, down on Bourbon Street
Set up, like a bowlin' pin
Knocked down, it gets to wearin' thin
They just won't let you be, oh no
You're sick of hangin' around and you'd like to travel
Get tired of travelin' and you want to settle down
I guess they can't revoke your soul for tryin'
Get out of the door and light out and look all around

Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me;
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

Truckin', I'm a goin' home
Whoa whoa baby, back where I belong
Back home, sit down and patch my bones
And get back truckin' on
Hey now get back truckin' home



Mother told me, yes, she told me
That I'd meet girls like you
She also told me, "Stay away
You'll never know what you'll catch"
Just the other day I heard
Of a soldier's falling off
Some Indonesian junk
That's going 'round

Mommy's alright
Daddy's alright
They just seem a little weird
Surrender
Surrender
But don't give yourself away
Hey, hey

Father says, "Your mother's right
She's really up on things
Before we married, Mommy served
In the WACS in the Philippines”
Now, I had heard the WACs recruited
Old maids for the war
But mommy isn't one of those
I've known her all these years
Mommy's alright
Daddy's alright
They just seem a little weird
Surrender
Surrender
But don't give yourself away
Hey, hey

Whatever happened to all this season's
Losers of the year?
Every time I got to thinking
Where'd they disappear?
But when I woke up, Mom and Dad
Are rolling on the couch
Rolling numbers, rock and rollin'
Got my KISS records out

Mommy's alright
Daddy's alright
They just seem a little weird
Surrender
Surrender
But don't give yourself away
Hey, hey
Away
Away
Surrender (Mommy's all right)
Surrender (Daddy's all right)
But don't give yourself away
Surrender (Mommy's all right)
Surrender (Daddy's all right)
But don't give yourself away
Surrender (Mommy's all right)
Surrender (Daddy's all right)
But don't give yourself away
Surrender (Mommy's all right)
Surrender (Daddy's all right)
But don't give yourself away
Surrender (Mommy's all right)
Surrender (Daddy's all right)
But don't give yourself away
Surrender (Mommy's all right)
Surrender (Daddy's all right)
But don't give yourself away
Surrender (Mommy's all right)
Surrender (Daddy's all right)
But don't give yourself away



Standing in the dock at Southampton
Trying to get to Holland or France
The man in the mac said, "You've got to go back"
You know they didn't even give us a chance

Christ you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're gonna crucify me

Finally made the plane into Paris
Honeymooning down by the Seine
Peter Brown called to say
"You can make it O.K
You can get married in Gibraltar, near Spain"

Christ you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're gonna crucify me

Drove from Paris to the Amsterdam Hilton
Talking in our beds for a week
The newspaper said, "Say what you doing in bed?"
I said, "We're only trying to get us some peace"
Christ you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're gonna crucify me

Saving up your money for a rainy day
Giving all your clothes to charity
Last night the wife said
"Poor boy, when you're dead
You don't take nothing with you but your soul"
Think!

Made a lightning trip to Vienna
Eating chocolate cake in a bag
The newspaper said, "She's gone to his head
They look just like two gurus in drag"

Christ you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're gonna crucify me
Caught the early plane back to London
Fifty acorns tied in a sack
The men from the press said, "We wish you success
It's good to have the both of you back"

Christ you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're gonna crucify me
The way things are going
They're gonna crucify me



There's a little black spot
On the sun today
It's the same old thing as yesterday
There's a black hat
Caught in a high tree top
There's a flag pole rag
And the wind won't stop

I have stood here before
Inside the pouring rain
With the world turning circles
Running 'round my brain
I guess I'm always hoping
That you'll end this reign
But it's my destiny
To be the king of pain

There's a little black spot
On the sun today
(That's my soul up there)
It's the same old thing as yesterday
(That's my soul up there)
There's a black hat
Caught in a high treetop
(That's my soul up there)
There's a flag pole rag
And the wind won't stop
(That's my soul up there)
I have stood here before
Inside the pouring rain
With the world turning circles
Running 'round my brain
I guess I'm always hoping
That you'll end this reign
But it's my destiny
To be the king of pain

There's a fossil that's trapped
In a high cliff wall
(That's my soul up there)
There's a dead salmon
Frozen in a waterfall
(That's my soul up there)
There's a blue whale beached
By a spring tide's ebb
(That's my soul up there)
There's a butterfly trapped
In a spider's web
(That's my soul up there)

I have stood here before
Inside the pouring rain
With the world turning circles
Running 'round my brain
I guess I'm always hoping
That you'll end this reign
But it's my destiny
To be the king of pain
There's a king on a throne
With his eyes torn out
There's a blind man looking
For a shadow of doubt
There's a rich man
Sleeping on a golden bed
There's a skeleton
Choking on a crust of bread

King of pain

There's a red fox torn
By a huntsman's pack
(That's my soul up there)
There's a black-winged gull
With a broken back
(That's my soul up there)
There's a little black spot
On the sun today
It's the same old thing as yesterday

I have stood here before
Inside the pouring rain
With the world turning circles
Running 'round my brain
I guess I'm always hoping
That you'll end this reign
But it's my destiny
To be the king of pain
King of pain, king of pain
King of pain, I'll always be
King of pain, I'll always be
King of pain, I'll always be
King of pain, I'll always be
King of pain, I'll always be
King of pain, I'll always be
King of pain, I'll always be
King of pain



{Intro}
I know you've deceived me, now here's a surprise
I know that you have, cause there's magic in my eyes
I can see for miles and miles and miles and miles and miles
Oh yeah
If you think that I don't know about the little tricks you've played
And never see you when deliberately you put things in my way
Well, here's a poke at you
You're going to choke on it too
You're going to lose that smile
Because all the while
I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles and miles and miles and miles
Oh yeah
You took advantage of my trust in you when I was so far away
I saw you holding lots of other guys and now you've got the nerve to say
That you still want me
Well, that's as may be
But you got to stand trial
Because all the while
I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles and miles and miles and miles
Oh yeah

I know you've deceived me, now here's a surprise
I know that you have, cause there's magic in my eyes
I can see for miles and miles and miles and miles and miles
Oh yeah
The Eiffel Tower and the Taj Mahal are mine to see on clear days
You thought that I would need a crystal ball to see right through the haze
Well, here's a poke at you
You're going to choke on it too
You're going to lose that smile
Because all the while
I can see for miles and miles

And miles and miles and miles and miles

Everyday in the week, I'm in a different city
If I stay too long, the people try to pull me down
They talk about me like a dog, talk about the clothes I wear
But they don't realize they're the ones who's square

Hey, and that's why you can't hold me down
I don't want to be down
I got to move on
Aw!

Stone free, to do what I please
Stone free, to ride the breeze
Stone free, I can't stay
I got to, got to, got to get away right now
Yeah, alright

Listen to this baby
A woman here, a woman there, try to keep me in a plastic cage
But they don't realize it's so easy to break
Oh but sometimes I can, ha
I can feel my heart kind of running hot
That's when I got to move, before I get caught
Hey, and that's why, listen to me baby, you can't hold me down
I don't want to be tied down
I got to be free
Aw!

I said
Stone free, to do what I please
Stone free, to ride the breeze
Stone free, I can't stay
I got to, got to, got to get away
Yeah, aw
Turn me loose baby

Yeah, aw!
Uh huh, yeah!

I said
Stone free, to ride the breeze
Stone free, to do what I please
Stone free, I can't stay
I got to, got to, got to, got to get away
Stone free
I'm gonna leave right now
Stone free
Don't turn on me back
Stone free
I'm going on down the highway, yeah
Stone free
Got to, got to, got to, got to, got to
Stone free
Ooh hell, bye bye baby
Stone free
Aw



Southern man better keep your head
Don't forget what your good book said
Southern change gonna come at last
Now your crosses are burning fast
Southern man

I saw cotton and I saw black
Tall white mansions and little shacks
Southern man, when will you pay them back?

I heard screaming and bullwhips cracking
How long? How long?

Southern man better keep your head
Don't forget what your good book said
Southern change gonna come at last
Now your crosses are burning fast
Southern man

Lily Belle, your hair is golden brown
I've seen your black man coming 'round
Swear by God, I'm gonna cut him down!
I heard screaming and bullwhips cracking
How long? How long?



Parody of "It's Only Rock and Roll" by the Rolling Stones
(Romans 8:28-39; Matthew 6:26-34, 10:29-31; Luke 12:6-7, 24-32; Proverbs 13:12)
If I could stick God's plan on a chart it would fill up all of outer space
Would you realize that all things coincide that's
What it says in Romans 8:28
Ev-ery-thin' - fits right on in
The puzzle by design
Nothing is enough to keep me apart
From the great love of Christ - Jesus Christ
I said - I know - it's all in God's control - but I like it
I know - it's all in God's control
And I like it, like it, yes, I do
Oh, well, I like it, I like it, I like it
I said can't you read the epistle goin' to the Romans?
If I could pick my life all apart
Still would slide right into place
Shouldn't we just trust - our Lord - He made us
Would it help if we explained - it's pre-arranged
And when I get down deep in a hole
Feel likes there's mud on my face
Should I start a-cryin' - look at that horizon
Surely things are going to change - keep the faith
I said - I know - it's all in God's control - but I like it
I know - it's all in God's control
And I like it, like it, yes, I do
Oh, well, I like it, I like it, I like it
I said can't you see that this whole world depends on Him?
And do ya think that you're the only one who's been down?
There's better things in store you know they're comin' around
CHORUS



(Hey man) Oh, leave me alone, you know
(Hey man) Oh, Henry, get off the phone, I gotta

This mellow thighed chick just put my spine out of place
(Hey man) My schooldays insane
(Hey man) My work's down the drain
(Hey man) Well, she's a total blam-blam
She said she had to squeeze it but she, and then she

Oh, don't lean on me, man, 'cause you can't afford the ticket
Back from Suffragette City

She's all right

(Hey, man) Oh, Henry, don't be unkind, go away
(Hey, man) I can't take you this time, no way
(Hey, man) Dear droogie, don't crash here
There's only room for one and here she comes, here she comes

Oh, don't lean on me, man, 'cause you can't afford the ticket

Ain't but one way out, baby, Lord I just can't go out the door
Ain't but one way out, baby and Lord, I just can't go out the door
'Cause there's a man down there - might be your man, I don't know

Lord, you got me trapped, woman, up on the second floor
If I get by this time I won't be trapped no more
So raise your window, baby and I can ease out soft and slow
And Lord, your neighbors, no they won't be
Talking that stuff that they don't know


Lord, I'm foolish to be here on the first place
I know some man gonna walk in and take my place, and
Ain't no way in the world I'm going out that front door
'Cause there's a man down there - might be your man, I don't know

'Cause there's a man down there - might be your man, I don't know
'Cause there's a man down there
Lord, it just might happen to be your man
Oh, it just-a might be your man
Mmm-mm-mmm-mm
Lord, it just-a might be your man
Oh baby, I just don't know



With a purposeful grimace and a terrible sound
He pulls the spitting high-tension wires down
Helpless people on subway trains
Scream, bug-eyed, as he looks in on them
He picks up a bus and he throws it back down
As he wades through the buildings toward the center of town

Oh, no, they say he's got to go
Go! Go! Godzilla, yeah

{Intro}

Don't you feel it growing, day by day
People getting ready for the news
Some are happy, some are sad
Woah, gotta let the music play
What the people need is a way to make them smile

Gotta get a message, get it on through
Oh now mamma don't you ask me why

Oh, oh, oh listen to the music

Feeling good, feeling fine

Stay with me
My love, I hope you'll always be
Right here by my side if ever I need you
Oh, my love
In your arms
I feel so safe and so secure
And every day is such a perfect day to spend
Alone with you

I will follow you, will you
Follow me all the
Days and nights that we
Know will be, I will
Stay with you will you
Stay with me just one
Single tear in each
Passing year

With the dark
Oh, I see so very clearly now
All my fears are drifting by me so slowly now
Fading away
I can say
The night is long, but you are here
Close at hand, oh, I'm better for the smile you give
And while I live I will

Follow you, will you
Follow me all the days and nights that we
Know will be I will
Stay with you will you
Stay with me just one
Single tear in each
Passing year there will be


I will follow you will you
Follow me All the
Days and nights that we
Know will be I will
Stay with you will you
Stay with me just one
Single tear in each
Passing year I will
Follow you, will you
Follow me all the
Days and nights that we
Know will be, I will
Stay with you, will you
Stay with me, just one
Single tear in each
Passing year, I will

I need a lover that won't drive me crazy
(I need a lover that won't drive me crazy)
I need a lover that won't drive me crazy
Some girl that knows the meaning of, uh
"Hey, hit the highway"

Well, I've been walkin' the streets up and down
Racing through the human jungles at night
I'm so confused, my mind is indifferent
Hey, I'm so weak, won't somebody shut off that light

Electricity runs through the video
And I watch it from this hole I call home
And all the stony's are dancin' to the radio
And I got the world calling me up here tonight on the phone

I need a lover that won't drive me crazy
Some girl to thrill me and then go away
I need a lover that won't drive me crazy
Some girl that knows the meaning of, uh
"Hey, hit the highway"
Well, I'm not wiped out by this poolroom life I'm living
I'm gonna quit this job and go to school, or head back home
And I'm not askin' to be loved or be forgiven
Hey, I just can't face shakin' in this bedroom
One more night alone

I need a lover that won't drive me crazy
I need a lover that won't drive me crazy
I need a lover that won't drive me crazy
Some girl that knows the meaning of, uh
"Hey, hit the highway"
I need a lover that won't drive me crazy
Some girl to thrill me and then go away
I need a lover that won't drive me crazy
Some girl that knows the meaning of, uh
"Hey, hit the highway"
You betcha



Born under a bad sign
I've been down since I began to crawl
If it wasn't for bad luck
I wouldn't have no luck at all

Bad luck and trouble's my only friend
I've been down ever since I was ten

Born under a bad sign
I've been down since I began to crawl
If it wasn't for bad luck
I wouldn't have no luck at all

More wine and women is all I crave
Big bad women gonna carry me to my grave

Born under a bad sign
I've been down since I began to crawl
If it wasn't for bad luck
I wouldn't have no luck at all

Bad luck and trouble's been my only friend
I've been down ever since I was ten

Born under a bad sign
I've been down since I began to crawl
If it wasn't for bad luck
I wouldn't have no luck
If it wasn't for real bad luck
I wouldn't have no luck at all
Born under a bad sign
Born under a bad sign

Woo-ho
Woo-ho-ho

No one looked as I walked by
Just an invitation would have been just fine
Said no to him again and again
First, he took my heart, then he ran
No one knows how I feel
What I say, unless you read between my lines
One man walked away from me
First he took my hand
Take me home

Stand back, stand back
In the middle of my room, I did not hear from you
It's alright, it's alright
To be standing in a line (Standing in a line)
To be standing in a line
I would cry

La la la la la la la la la
La la
La la la la la

Do not turn away my friend
Like a willow, I can bend
No man calls my name
No man came
So, I walked on down, away from you
Maybe your attention was more than you could do
One man did not call
He asked me for my love, and that was all
Stand back, stand back
In the middle of my room, I did not hear from you
It's alright, it's alright
To be standing in a line (Standing in a line)
To be standing in a line
I would cry

La la la la la la la la la
La la
La la la la la la la
Doo-doo, doo-doo
La la la la la la la la la
La la la la
La la la la la, wo-ah

So, I walked, walked down the line, away from you
Maybe your attention was more than I could do
One man did not call
Well, he asked me for my love, that was all

Stand back, stand back
In the middle of my room, I did not hear from you
It's alright, it's alright
To be standing in a line (Standing in a line)
To be standing in a line
I would cry
Need a little, need a little sympathy
Well, I need a little sympathy (Cry)
Well, I need a little sympathy
Well, you could be standing in (Stand back)
Well, you could be standing in (Stand back)
Well, you could be standing in (Stand back)
Take me home
Take me home (Stand back)
Won't you take me home?
Well, I need a little sympathy (Stand back)
Well, you could be standing in (Stand back)
Why don't you take me home?
Why don't you take me home? (Stand back)
Take me home (Alright)
Take me home (Alright)



Lonely is the night when you find yourself alone
Your demons come to light and your mind is not your own
Lonely is the night when there's no one left to call
You feel the time is right, say, the writing's on the wall, yeah
And it's a high time to fight when the walls are closing in
A-call it what you like, it's time you got to win
Lonely, lonely, lonely, your spirit's sinking down
You find you're not the only stranger in this town
Red lights, green lights, stop and go jive
Headlines, deadlines jamming your mind
You been stealing shots from the side
Let your feelings go for a ride
There's danger out tonight, the man is on the prowl
Get the dynamite, the boys are set to prowl
Lonely is the night when you hear the voices call
Are you ready for a fight? Do you wanna take it all?
Slowdown, showdown, waiting on line
Showtime, no time, changing your mind
Streets are ringing, march to the sound
Let your secrets follow you down
Somebody's watching you, baby, so much you can do
Nobody's stopping you, baby, from making it too
One glimpse'll show you now, baby, what the music can do
One kiss'll show you now, baby, it can happen to you
No more sleeping, wasting our time
Midnight creeping's first on our mind
No more lazing around the TV
You'll go crazy, come out with me
Say you're lonely?
Come out
Lonely is the night
A-you don't have to be lonely
Come out
Lonely is the night



Got me the strangest woman
Believe me this trick's no cinch
But I really get her going
When I whip out my big 10 inch

Record of a band that plays the blues
Well a band that plays the blues
She just love my big 10 inch
Record of her favorite blues

Last night I tried to tease her
I gave my love a little pinch
She said now stop that jivin'
Now whip out your big 10 inch

Record of a band that plays the blues
Well a band that plays the blues
She just love my big 10 inch
Record of her favorite blues

I, I, I cover her with kisses
And when we're in a lover's clinch
She gets all excited
When she begs for my big 10 inch
Record of a band that plays the blues
Well a band that plays the blues
She just love my big 10 inch
Record of her favorite blues


My girl don't go for smoking
And liquor just make her flinch
Seems she don't go for nothing
'Cept for my big 10 inch

Record of a band that plays the blues
Band that plays the blues
She just love my big 10 inch
Record of her favorite blues



I can't light no more of your darkness
All my pictures seem to fade to black and white
I'm growin' tired, and time stands still before me
Frozen here on the ladder of my life

Too late to save myself from falling
I took a chance and changed your way of life
But you misread my meanin' when I met you
Closed the door and left me blinded by the light

Don't let the sun go down on me
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free
But losin' everything is like the sun goin' down on me

I can't find, oh, the right romantic line
But see me once and see the way I feel
Don't discard me just because you think I mean you harm
But these cuts I have, oh, they need love to help them heal

Don't let the sun go down on me
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free
But losin' everything is like the sun goin' down on me
Don't let the sun go down on me
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free, yeah
But losin' everything is like the sun goin' down on me



Way back when, in '67
I was the dandy of Gamma Chi
Sweet things from Boston
So young and willing
Moved down to Scarsdale
Where the hell am I?

She's totally committed
To major independence
But she's a lady through and through
She gives them quite a battle
All that they can handle
She'll bruise some
She'll hurt some too
But oh they love to watch her strut
Oh they do respect her but
They love to watch her strut
Sometimes they'll want to leave her
Just give up and leave her
But they would never play that scene
In spite of all her talking
Once she starts in walking
The lady will be all they ever dreamed
Oh they'll love to watch her strut
Oh they'll kill to make the cut
They love to watch her strut
Yeah love to watch her strut
Watch her strut



Well, they say it's kinda fright'nin' how this younger generation swings
You know, it's more than just some new sensation
Well, the kid is into losin' sleep and he don't come home for half the week
You know, it's more than just an aggravation

And the cradle will rock
Yes, the cradle will rock
And I say, rock on!
Rock on!

And when some local kid gets down, they try and drum him out of town
They say, "You coulda least faked it, boy."
At an early age he hits the street and winds up tied with who he meets, and he's unemployed

And the cradle will rock
Yeah, the cradle will rock
And I say, rock on!
Rock on!
Have you seen Junior's grades?

And when some local kid gets down, they try and drum him out of town
They say, "You coulda least faked it, boy."
Faked it, boy
At an early age he hits the street and winds up tied with who he meets, and he's unemployed
His folks are overjoyed
And the cradle will rock
Yeah, the cradle will rock
And I say, rock on!
Rock on!
Rock on!
Rock on!



Leave your cares behind
Come with us and find
The pleasures of a journey to the center of the mind

Come along if you care
Come along if you dare
Take a ride to the land inside of your mind

Beyond the seas of thought
Beyond the realm of what
Across the streams of hopes and dreams where things are really not

Come along if you care
Come along if you dare
Take a ride to the land inside of your mind

But please realize
You'll probably be surprised
For it's the land unknown to man
Where fantasy is fact
So if you can, please understand
You might not come back

Come along if you care
Come along if you dare
Take a ride to the land inside and you'll see

How happy life could be
If all of mankind
Would take the time to journey to the center of the mind
Would take the time to journey to the center of the mind
Center of the mind



I've been drinkin', I've been drinkin'
I get filthy when that liquor get into me
I've been thinkin', I've been thinkin'
Why can't I keep my fingers off it?
Baby, I want you, now-now
Why can't I keep my fingers off you?
Baby, I want you, na na
Cigars on ice, cigars on ice
Feelin' like an animal with these cameras all in my grill
Flashin' lights, flashin' lights
You got me faded, faded, faded
Baby, I want you, na na
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy, I want you, na na
Drunk in love, I want you

We woke up in the kitchen
Saying, "How the hell did this shit happen?"
Oh, baby
Drunk in love
We be all night
Last thing I remember is our beautiful bodies
Grindin' up in that club
Drunk in love
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love

We be all night, and everything all right
No complaints from my body
So fluorescent under these lights
Boy, I'm drinkin', park it in my lot, 7-11
I'm rubbin' on it, rub-rubbin'
If you scared, call that reverend
Boy, I'm drinkin', get my brain right
Armand de Brignac, gangster wife
Louis sheets, he sweat it out
Like washrags, he wet it up
Boy, I'm drinkin', I'm singin'
On the mic to my boy toys
Then I fill the tub up halfway
Then ride it with my surfboard
Surfboard, surfboard
Grainin' on that wood
Grainin'-grainin' on that wood
I'm swervin' on that, swervin'-swervin' on that
Big body been servin' all this
Swerve, surfin' all in this good-good
Hahaha!
We woke up in the kitchen
Saying, "How the hell did this shit happen?"
Oh, baby
Drunk in love
We be all night
Last thing I remember is our beautiful bodies
Grindin' up in that club
Drunk in love

We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love
I'm nice right now… Hold up!

That D'USSÉ is the shit, if I do say so myself
If I do say so myself, if I do say so myself
Hold up, stumble all in the house
Time to back up all of that mouth
That you had all in the car
Talkin' 'bout you the baddest bitch thus far
Talkin' 'bout you be reppin' that Third
I wanna see all that shit that I heard
Know I sling Clint Eastwood
Hope you can handle this curve, uh
Foreplay in a foyer, fucked up my Warhol
Slid the panties right to the side
Ain't got the time to take drawers off
On sight, catch a charge I might
Beat the box up, like Mike in '97, I bite
I'm Ike Turner, turn up, baby, no, I don't play
"Now eat the cake, Anna Mae!"
Said, "Eat the cake, Anna Mae!"
I'm nice, for y'all to reach these heights
You gon' need G3, 4, 5, 6 flights
Sleep tight, we sex again in the morning
Your breasteses is my breakfast
We goin' in, we be all night
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love

I'm never tired, never tired
I been sippin', that's the only thing
That's keepin' me on fire, we on fire
Didn't mean to spill that liquor all on my attire
I've been drinkin', watermelon
I want your body right here
Daddy, I want you, right now
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy, I want you

We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love



{Intro}

You can take me to the paradise
And then again you can be cold as ice
I'm over my head (over my head)
Oh, but it sure feels nice

You can take me anytime you like
I'll be around if you think you might
Love me, baby (over my head)
And hold me tight

Your mood is like a circus wheel
You're changing all the time
Sometimes I can't help but feel
That I'm wasting all of my time
{Instrumental}

Your mood is like a circus wheel
You're changing all the time
Sometimes I can't help but feel
That I'm wasting all of my time
I think, I'm looking on the dark side
But everyday you hurt my pride
I'm over my head (over my head)
Oh, but it sure feels nice
I'm over my head (over my head)
But it sure feels nice
I'm over my head (over my head)
But it sure feels nice
{Outro}



No matter what you are
I will always be with you
Doesn't matter what you do, girl
Ooh girl, with you

No matter what you do
I will always be around
Won't you tell me what you found, girl
Ooh girl, won't you?

Knock down the old grey wall
Be a part of it all
Nothing to say, nothing to see, nothing to do
If you would give me all
As I would give it to you
Nothing would be, nothing would be, nothing would be

No matter where you go
There will always be a place
Can't you see it in my face, girl?
Ooh girl, want you

Knock down the old grey wall
Be a part of it all
Nothing to say, nothing to see, nothing to do
If you would give me all
As I would give it to you
Nothing would be, nothing would be, nothing would be

No matter what you are
I will always be with you
Doesn't matter what you do, girl
Ooh girl, with you
Ooh girl, you girl, want you
Ooh girl, you girl, want you



They pulled in just behind the bridge
He lays her down, he frowns
"Gee, my life's a funny thing
Am I still too young?"
He kissed her then and there
She took his ring, took his babies
It took him minutes, took her nowhere
Heaven knows, she'd have taken anything, but

(All night)
She wants the young American
(Young American, young American)
(She wants the young American)
(All right)
She wants the young American

Scanning life through the picture window
She finds the slinky vagabond
He coughs as he passes her Ford Mustang
But Heaven forbid, she'll take anything
But the freak, and his type, all for nothing
He misses a step and cuts his hand, but
Showing nothing, he swoops like a song
She cries "Where have all Papa's heroes gone?"
(All night)
She wants the young American
(Young American, young American)
(She wants the young American)
(All right)
But she wants the young American

All the way from Washington
Her bread-winner begs off the bathroom floor
"We live for just these twenty years
Do we have to die for the fifty more?"

All night
He wants the young American
(Young American, young American)
(He wants the young American)
(All right) All right
He wants the young American

Do you remember, your President Nixon?
Do you remember, the bills you have to pay?
Or even yesterday?
Have you been the un-American?
Just you and your idol sing falsetto
'bout Leather, leather everywhere
And not a myth left from the ghetto
Well, well, well, would you carry a razor
In case, just in case of depression?
Sit on your hands on a bus of survivors
Blushing at all the Afro-Sheeners
Ain't that close to love?
Well, ain't that poster love?
Well, it ain't that Barbie doll
Her heart's been broken just like you and

(All night)
All night, you want the young American
(Young American) young American
(You want the young American) All right
All right
You want the young American

You ain't a pimp and you ain't a hustler
A pimp's got a Cadi and a lady got a Chrysler
Black's got respect, and white's got his soul train
Mama's got cramps, and look at your hands ache
(I heard the news today, oh boy)
I got a suite and you got defeat
Ain't there a man who can say no more?
And ain't there a woman I can sock on the jaw?
And, ain't there a child I can hold without judging?
Ain't there a pen that will write before they die?
Ain't you proud that you've still got faces?
Ain't there one damn song that can make me break down and cry?
All night
I want the young American
(Young American) young American
(I want the young American)
All right
I want the young American, young American

(Young American, young American)
(I want the young American)
(All night)
You want I, I want you
(Young American, young American)
(I want the young American)
(All right)
All I want is the young American
(Young American, young American)
(I want the young American)
(All night)



It's been a mystery
And still they try to see
Why something good can hurt so bad
Caught on a one-way street
The taste of bittersweet
Love will survive somehow, some way

One love feeds the fire
One heart burns desire
I wonder, who's crying now
Two hearts born to run
Who'll be the lonely one
I wonder who's crying now

So many stormy nights
So many wrongs or rights
Neither could change
Their headstrong ways
And in a lover's rage
They tore another page
The fighting is worth
The love they save
One love feeds the fire
One heart burns desire
I wonder who's crying now
Two hearts born to run
Who'll be the lonely one
I wonder who's crying now

Only so many tears you can cry
'Till the heartache is over
And now you can say your love
Will never die
Whoooooa-oh-whoa
Whoooa-oh
Ooooooh-whoa, ooh-whooa

One love feeds the fire
One heart burns desire
Wonder who's crying now
Two hearts born to run
Who will be the lonely one
Wonder who's crying now



Somewhere out there on that horizon
Out beyond the neon lights
I know there must be something better
But there's nowhere else in sight
It's survival in the city
When you live from day to day
City streets don't have much pity
When you're down, that's where you'll stay

In the city (oh, oh)
In the city (oh, ohhh)

I was born here in the city
With my back against the wall
Nothing grows and life ain't very pretty
No one's there to catch you when you fall
Somewhere out on that horizon
Far away from the neon sky
I know there must be something better
And I can't stay another night

In the city (oh, oh)
In the city (oh, ohhh)
In the city
In the city
In the city (oh, ohhh)



Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me

I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I don't need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me

I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

You're asking me will my love grow
I don't know, I don't know
You stick around, now it may show
I don't know, I don't know

Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me

I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how



Down the street you can hear her scream "You're a disgrace"
As she slams the door in his drunken face
And now he stands outside
And all the neighbors start to gossip and drool
He cries "Oh girl, you must be mad
What happened to the sweet love you and me had?"
Against the door he leans and starts a scene
And his tears fall and burn the garden green

And so castles made of sand
Fall in the sea eventually

A little Indian brave who before he was ten
Played war games in the woods with his Indian friends
And he built a dream that when he grew up
He would be a fearless warrior, Indian Chief
Many moons passed, and more the dream grew strong
Until tomorrow he would sing his first war song
And fight his first battle
But something went wrong
Surprise attack killed him in his sleep that night

And so castles made of sand
Melts into the sea eventually
There was a young girl whose heart was a frown
Because she was crippled for life and she couldn't speak a sound
And she wished and prayed she could stop living
So she decided to die
She drew her wheelchair to the edge of the shore
And to her legs she smiled, "You won't hurt me no more"
But then a sight she'd never seen made her jump and say:
"Look a golden winged ship is passing my way
And it really didn't have to stop
It just kept on going

And so castles made of sand
Slips into the sea, eventually



When I was a young boy
Said put away those young boy ways
Now that I'm getting' older so much older
I long for those young boy days

With a girl like you
With a girl like you
Lord knows there are things we can do, baby
Just me and you
Come on and make it a

Hurt so good
Come on baby make it hurt so good
Sometimes love don't feel like it should
You make it hurt so good

You don't have to be so exciting
Just trying to give myself a little bit of fun, yeah
You always look so inviting
You ain't as green as you are young
Hey baby it's you
Come on girl now it's you
Sink your teeth right through my bones, baby
Let's see what we can do
Come on and make it a

Hurt so good
Come on baby make it hurt so good
Sometimes love don't feel like it should
You make it
A-hurt so good
I ain't talking no big deals
I ain't made no plans myself
I ain't talking no high heels
Maybe we could walk around, all day long
Walk around, all day long
Ugh!

Hurt so good
Come on baby make it hurt so good
Sometimes love don't feel like it should
You make it hurt so good
Hurt so good (come on baby, now)
Come on baby make it hurt so good
Sometimes love don't feel like it should
You make it hurt so good

Ey, ey



Wait a minute baby
Stay with me awhile
Said you'd give me light
But you never told me 'bout the fire

Drowning in the sea of love
Where everyone would love to drown
But now it's gone
It doesn't matter what for
When you build your house
Then call me home

And he was just like a great dark wing
Within the wings of a storm
I think I had met my match
He was singing
And undoing, and undoing
Ooh the laces
Undoing the laces

Said Sara, you're the poet in my heart
Never change, never stop
But now it's gone
It doesn't matter what for
But when you build your house
Oh then call me home
Hold on
The night is coming and the starling flew for days
I'd stay home at night all the time
I'd go anywhere, anywhere, anywhere
Ask me and I'm there, yeah
Ask me and I'm there 'cause I care

In the sea of love
Where every woman would love to drown
But now it's gone
They say it doesn't matter anymore
If you build your house
Then please, call me home

Sara, you're the poet in my heart
Never change, and don't you ever stop
And now it's gone
No, it doesn't matter anymore
When you build your house
I'll come by

Sara
All I ever wanted, was to know that you were dreaming, Sara
There’s a heartbeat that never really died
Oh, won't you swallow your pride?



Times are hard
You're afraid to pay the fee
So you find yourself somebody
Who can do the job for free
When you need a bit of lovin'
'Cause your man is out of town
That's the time you get me runnin'
And you know I'll be around

I'm a fool to do your dirty work, oh yeah
I don't wanna do your dirty work no more
I'm a fool to do your dirty work, oh yeah

Light the candle
Put the lock upon the door
You have sent the maid home early
Like a thousand times before
Like the castle in its corner
In a medieval game
I foresee terrible trouble
And I stay here just the same

I'm a fool to do your dirty work, oh yeah
I don't wanna do your dirty work no more
I'm a fool to do your dirty work, oh yeah


I'm a fool to do your dirty work, oh yeah
I don't wanna do your dirty work no more
I'm a fool to do your dirty work, oh yeah
I don't wanna do your dirty work no more

I'm a fool to do your dirty work, oh yeah
I don't wanna do your dirty work no more



Well she's walking, through the clouds
With a circus mind that's running round
Butterflies and zebras
And moonbeams
And-a, fairytales
That's all she ever thinks about
Riding with the wind
When I'm sad, she comes to me
With a thousand smiles she gives to me free
It's alright, she said, it's alright
Take anything you want from me
Anything, anything
Fly on, little wing

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, little wing



{Intro}
Here comes old Rosie she's looking mighty fine
Here comes hot Nancy she's steppin' right on time
There go the street lights bringin on the night
Here come the men faces hidden from the light
All through the shadows they come and they go
With only one thing in common
They got the fire down below
Here comes the rich man in his big long limousine
Here comes the poor man all you got to have is green
Here comes the banker and the lawyer and the cop
One thing for certain it ain't never gonna stop
When it all gets too heavy
That's when they come and go
With only one thing in common
They got the fire down below
It happens out in Vegas, happens in Moline
On the blue blood streets of Boston
Up in Berkeley and out in Queens
And it went on yesterday and it's going on tonight
Somewhere there's somebody ain't treatin' somebody right
And he's looking out for Rosie and she's looking mighty fine
And he's walking the streets for Nancy
And he'll find her every time
And when the street lights flicker bringing on the night
Well they'll be slipping into darkness slipping out of sight
All through the midnight
Watch 'em come and watch 'em go
Oh, c'mon
With only one thing in common
They got the fire down below
{outro}
Burning down below



When I became of age, my mama sat me down
She said, "Son, you're growing up, it's time you looked around."
So I began to notice some things I've never seen before
That's what brought me here knockin' at your back door
Oh, yeah
A closet queen, a bus stop fiend
It wants to shake my hand
I don't want to be there, she decides she can
It's Apple Dan, he's just the man to pick fruit off your branches
I can't sleep and we can't keep this cattle off our ranches
Oh, oh... yeah
It's too strong, something's wrong, I guess I lost the feeling
I don't mind the games you play, but I don't like you dealing
The cards looked bad, the luck's been had and there's nothing left to smoke
We'll all be back tomorrow for the punchline of the joke
Oh, Oh... Oh, Oh...



Growin' up, my mama explained the difference between fame and notoriety
See fame is when people know you
Notoriety is when people know your work
And notoriety leave a legacy
When they talk about us
When they talk about big arrangements
When they talkin' 'bout Lucci
When they talkin' 'bout TIG
Some will hate, some will cheer
All will know one thing
My nigga Nut, we came and changed the music game forever

Lately I been chasin' paper, chasin' guap, yeah, yeah

Uh, uh , I been a thug all my life, wanted a plug all my life

Fuck nigga, don't make me put a slug in 'em

If a nigga take my life, I pray he see me smilin', boss

Lately I been chasin' paper, chasin' guap, yeah, yeah
Lately I been feelin' like fuck a hater, fuck a cop, yeah, yeah
I swear lately I been heartless, heartless, heartless, heartless, yeah

The lights are on, but you're not home
Your mind is not your own
Your heart sweats, your body shakes
Another kiss is what it takes
You can't sleep, you can't eat
There's no doubt, you're in deep
Your throat is tight, you can't breathe
Another kiss is all you need

Whoa, you like to think that you're immune to the stuff, oh yeah
It's closer to the truth to say you can't get enough
You know you're going to have to face it, you're addicted to love

You see the signs, but you can't read
You're running at a different speed
Your heart beats in double time
Another kiss and you'll be mine
A one-track mind, you can't be saved
Oblivion is all you crave
If there's some left for you
You don't mind if you do
Whoa, you like to think that you're immune to the stuff, oh yeah
It's closer to the truth to say you can't get enough
You know you're going to have to face it, you're addicted to love

Might as well face it, you're addicted to love
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love

Your lights are on, but you're not home
Your will is not your own
Your heart sweats your teeth grind
Another kiss and you'll be mine

Whoa, you like to think that you're immune to the stuff, oh yeah
It's closer to the truth to say you can't get enough
You know you're going to have to face it, you're addicted to love

Might as well face it, you're addicted to love
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love



You make me weep, and wanna die
Just when you said we'd try
Loving, touching, squeezing each other
When I'm alone all by myself
You're out with someone else
Loving, touching, squeezing each other

You're tearing me apart
Every, every day
You're tearing me apart
Oh, what can I say?
You're tearing me apart

It won't be long, yes, 'til you're alone
When your lover, oh, he hasn't come home
'Cause he's loving, ooh, he's touching
He's squeezing another

He's tearing you apart
Ooh, every, every day
He's tearing you apart
Oh, girl, what can you say?
Cause he's loving, touching another
Now it's your turn, girl, to cry
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na
Na na na na na na

Spent some time feelin' inferior
Standing in front of my mirror
Combed my hair in a thousand ways
But I came out looking just the same
Daddy said, "Son, you better see the world
I wouldn't blame you if you wanted to leave
But remember one thing don't lose your head
To a woman that'll spend your bread"
So I got out, woo

Paris was a place you could hide away
If you felt you didn't fit in
French police wouldn't give me no peace
They claimed I was a nasty person
Down along the Left Bank minding my own
Was knocked down by a human stampede
Got arrested for inciting a peaceful riot
When all I wanted was a cup of tea
I was accused, woo
I moved on

Down in Rome, I wasn't getting enough
Of the things that keep a young man alive
My body stunk but I kept my funk, woo
At a time when I was right out of luck
Getting desperate, indeed I was, yeah
Looking like a tourist attraction
Oh my dear, I better get out of here
'fore the Vatican don't give no sanction
I wasn't ready for that, no no
I moved right out east, yeah, listen
On the Peking ferry I was feeling merry
Sailing on my way back here
I fell in love with a slit-eyed lady
By the light of an eastern moon
Shangai Lil never used the pill
She claimed that it just ain't natural
She took me up on deck and bit my neck
Oh people, I was glad I found her
Oh yeah, I was glad I found her, woohoo
Wait a minute

I firmly believe that I didn't need anyone but me
I sincerely thought I was so complete
Look how wrong you can be
The women I've known I wouldn't let tie my shoe
They wouldn't give you the time of day
But the slit-eyed lady knocked me off my feet
God I was glad I found her
And if they had the words I could tell to you
To help you on the way down the road
I couldn't quote you no Dickens, Shelley or Keats
'Cause it's all been said before
Make the best out of the bad, just laugh it off, ha
You didn't have to come here anyway
So remember, every picture tells a story, don't it
Every picture tells a story, don't it
Every picture tells a story, don't it, woo
Every picture tells a story, don't it
Every picture tells a story, don't it, woo
Every picture tells a story, don't it
Every picture tells a story, don't it
Every picture tells a story, don't it
Every picture tells a story, don't it
Every picture tells a story, don't it
Every picture tells a story, don't it
Every picture tells a story, don't it
Every picture tells a story, don't it
Every picture tells a story, don't it
Every picture tells a story, don't it, woo
Every picture tells a story, don't it, woo
Every picture tells a story, don't it, woo
Every picture tells a story, don't it, woo
Every picture tells a story, don't it, woo
Every picture tells a story, don't it
Every picture tells a story, don't it
Every picture tells a story, don't it



Well my Daddy said I'm messy 'bout the whiskers on my chin
Never had no problems 'cause I've always paid the rent
I got no time for loving 'cause my time is all used up
I spend my time creating for some groovy kinds of love

I'm a man, yes I am
And I can't help but love you so
I'm a man, yes I am
And I can't help but love you so

If I had my choice of matter, I'd rather be content
Being closer to the chatter, showing where your mind is at
While relating to each other, how strong your love could be
'Cept for only sometimes groovy chicks you see

I'm a man, yes I am
And I can't help but love you so
I'm a man, yes I am
And I can't help but love you so
I've got to keep my image, while I'm standing on the floor
If I drop upon my knees, it's just to keep them on my nose
You think that I'm not human, and my heart is made of stone
But I've never had no problems, and my body's pretty strong

I'm a man, yes I am
And I can't help but love you so
I'm a man, yes I am
And I can't help but love you so


If I had my choice of matter, I would rather be content
All engrossed in mental chatter, showin' where your mind is at
While relating to each other, how good your love can be
Resisting only some times groovy chicks you see

I'm a man, yes I am
And I can't help but love you so
I'm a man, yes I am
And I can't help but love you so
I've got to keep my image, while I'm standing on the floor
If I drop upon my knees, it's just to keep them on my nose
You think that I'm not human, and my heart is made of stone
But I've never had no problems, and my body's pretty strong

I'm a man, yes I am
And I can't help but love you so
Man, yes I am
And I can't help but love you so
Man, yes I am
And I can't help but love you so
Man, yes I am
And I can't help but love you so



There must be some misunderstanding
There must be some kind of mistake
I waited in the rain for hours
You were late
Now it's not like me to say the right thing
But you could've called to let me know
I checked your number twice, don't understand it
So I went home
Well I'd been waiting for this weekend
I thought that maybe we could see a show
Never dreamed I'd have this feeling
But seeing you is believing
That's why I don't know why
You didn't show up that night
There must be some misunderstanding
There must be some kind of mistake
I was waiting in the rain for hours
You were late
Since then I've been running around trying to find you
I went to the places that you always go
I rang your house but got no answer
Jumped in my car, i went round there
I still don't believe it
He was just leaving
There must be some misunderstanding
There must be some kind of mistake



Stuck inside these four walls
Sent inside forever
Never seeing no one nice again
Like you
Mama, you
Mama, you


If I ever get out of here
Thought of giving it all away to a registered charity
All I need is a pint a day if I ever get out of here
If we ever get out of here


Well, the rain exploded with a mighty crash
As we fell into the sun
And the first one said to the second one there
"I hope you're having fun"

Band on the run
Band on the run
And the jailer man and Sailor Sam
Were searching everyone
For the band on the run
Band on the run
For the band on the run
Band on the run
Well, the undertaker drew a heavy sigh
Seeing no one else had come
And a bell was ringing in the Village Square
For the rabbits on the run

Band on the run
Band on the run
And the jailer man and Sailor Sam
Were searching everyone
For the band on the run
Band on the run
Yeah, the band on the run
Band on the run
Band on the run
Band on the run

Well, the night was falling as the desert world
Began to settle down
In the town they're searching for us everywhere
But we never will be found

Band on the run
Band on the run
And the County Judge, who held a grudge
Will search forevermore
For the band on the run
Band on the run
Band on the run
Band on the run



Well you're dirty and sweet
Clad in black don't look back and I love you

Take me, for a meanwhile I'm still thinking



Well, I'm so tired of cryin' but I'm out on the road again
I'm on the road again
Well, I'm so tired of cryin' but I'm out on the road again
I'm on the road again
I ain't got no woman just to call my special friend
You know the first time I traveled out in the rain and snow
In the rain and snow
You know the first time I traveled out in the rain and snow
In the rain and snow
I didn't have no payroll, not even no place to go
And my dear mother left me when I was quite young
When I was quite young
And my dear mother left me when I was quite young
When I was quite young
She said "Lord, have mercy on my wicked son"
Take a hint from me, mama, please, don't you cry no more
Don't you cry no more
Take a hint from me, mama, please, don't you cry no more
Don't you cry no more
'Cause it's soon one morning down the road I'm going
But I ain't going down that long, old lonesome road
All by myself
But I ain't going down that long, old lonesome road
All by myself
I can't carry you, baby, gonna carry somebody else



Well, baby used to stay out all night long
She made me cry, she done me wrong
She hurt my eyes open, that's no lie
Tables turn and now her turn to cry

Because I used to love her, but it's all over now
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now

Well, she used to run around with every man in town
She spent all my money, playing her high class game
She put me out, it was a pity how I cried
Tables turn and now her turn to cry
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now
Well, I used to walk in the morning, get my breakfast in bed
When I'd gotten worried she'd ease my aching head
But now she's here and there, with every man in town
Still trying to take me for that same old clown

Because I used to love her, but it's all over now
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now

Whoopa, hey mesa, hooba huffa, hey meshy goosh goosh

Looking at the world through the sunset in your eyes
Traveling the train through clear Moroccan skies
Ducks and pigs and chickens call, animal carpet wall to wall
American ladies five-foot tall in blue

Sweeping cobwebs from the edges of my mind
Had to get away to see what we could find
Hope the days that lie ahead bring us back to where they've led
Listen not to what's been said to you

Would you know we're riding on the Marrakesh Express?
Would you know we're riding on the Marrakesh Express?
They're taking me to Marrakesh
All aboard the train, all aboard the train

I've been saving all my money just to take you there
I smell the garden in your hair

Take the train from Casablanca going South
Blowing smoke rings from the corners of my mouth
Colored cottons hang in the air
Charming cobras in the square
Striped djellabas we can wear at home
Well, let me hear ya now
Would you know we're riding on the Marrakesh Express?
Would you know we're riding on the Marrakesh Express?
They're taking me to Marrakesh
Would you know we're riding on the Marrakesh Express?
Would you know we're riding on the Marrakesh Express?
They're taking me to Marrakesh
All aboard the train, all aboard the train, all aboard

People say I'm crazy doing what I'm doing
Well they give me all kinds of warnings to save me from ruin
When I say that I'm okay well they look at me kind of strange
Surely you're not happy now you no longer play the game
People say I'm lazy dreaming my life away
Well they give me all kinds of advice designed to enlighten me
When I tell 'em that I'm doing fine watching shadows on the wall
Don't you miss the big time boy? You're no longer on the ball

I'm just sitting here watching the wheels go round and round
I really love to watch them roll
No longer riding on the merry-go-round
I just had to let it go

People asking questions lost in confusion
Well I tell them there's no problem
Only solutions
Well they shake their heads and they look at me
As if I've lost my mind
I tell them there's no hurry
I'm just sitting here doing time

I'm just sitting here watching the wheels go round and round
I really love to watch them roll
No longer riding on the merry-go-round
I just had to let it go
I just had to let it go
I just had to let it go

Lonely feeling deep inside
Find a corner where I can hide
Silent footsteps crowding me
Sudden darkness but I can see
No sugar tonight in my coffee
No sugar tonight in my tea
No sugar to stand beside me
No sugar to run with me
Dat'n-doo-dow dow-dat'n-doo-dow
Dat'n-doo-dow dow-dow-dow
Dat'n-doo-dow dow-dat'n-doo-dow
Dat'n-doo-dow dow
In the silence of her mind
Quiet movements where I can find
Grabbing for me with her eyes
Now I'm falling from her skies
No sugar tonight in my coffee
No sugar tonight in my tea
No sugar to stand beside me
No sugar to run with me
Dat'n-doo-dow dow-dat'n-doo-dow
Dat'n-doo-dow dow-dow-dow
Dat'n-doo-dow dow-dat'n-doo-dow
Dat'n-doo-dow dow
Jocko says "Yes" and I believe him
When we talk about the things I say
She hasn't got the faith or the guts to leave him
When they're standing in each other's way
You're tripping back now to places you've been to
You wonder what you're gonna find
You know you've been wrong but it won't be long
Before you leave 'em all far behind
'Cause it's the new mother nature taking over
It's the new splendid lady come to call
It's the new mother nature taking over
She's gettin' us all
She's gettin' us all
Jocko said "No" when I came back last time
It's looking like I lost a friend
No use callin' 'cause the sky is fallin'
And I'm getting pretty near the end
A smoke-filled room in a corner basement
The situation must be right
A bag of goodies and a bottle of wine
We're gonna get it on right tonight
'Cause it's the new mother nature taking over
It's the new splendid lady come to call
It's the new mother nature taking over
She's gettin' us all
She's gettin' us all
(Lonely feeling) Jocko says "Yes" and I believe him
(Deep inside) When we talk about the things I say
(Find a corner) She hasn't got the faith or the guts to leave him
(Where I can hide) When they're standing in each other's way
(Silent footsteps) You're tripping back now to places you've been to
(Crowding me) You wonder what you're gonna find
(Sudden darkness) You know you've been wrong and it won't be long
(But I can see) Before you leave 'em all far behind
'Cause it's the new mother nature taking over
It's the new splendid lady come to call
It's the new mother nature taking over
She's gettin' us all
She's gettin' us all

Two feets, they come a creepin'
Like a black cat do
And two bodies are layin' naked
A creeper think he got nothin' to lose

So he creeps into this house, yeah
And unlocks the door
An' as the man's reaching for his trousers
He shoots him full of 38 holes

Mister Saturday Night Special
Got a barrel that's blue and cold
It ain't good for nothing but puttin' men six feet in a hole

Big Jim's been drinking whiskey
And playing poker on a losing night
An' pretty soon, Ol' Jim starts a-thinkin'
Somebody been cheatin' and lyin'
So Big Jim commence to fighting
I wouldn't tell you no lie
Big Jim done pulled his pistol
Shot his friend right between the eyes
Mister Saturday Night Special
Got a barrel that's blue and cold
It ain't good for nothing but puttin' men six feet in a hole

Hmm, and that's the Saturday Night Special
For twenty dollars, you can buy yourself one, too
Here it come

Oh, lemme tell you all about it

Hand guns are made for killing
They ain't no good for nothing else
And if you like to drink your whiskey
You might even shoot yourself

So why don't we dump 'em, people, to the bottom of the sea?
Before some old fool come around here
Wanna shoot either you, or me
Mister Saturday Night Special
You got a barrel that's blue and cold
You ain't good for nothing but puttin' men six feet in a hole

It's a Saturday Night Special
And I'd like to tell you what you can do with it, too
And that's the end of this song



You know, I remember a few years ago
Some funny things used to happen to me
About 1956-57
At that time there was no blues scene
Or not really any kind of scene in London
I used to go out and play my guitar in the streets
And sing things with passing my hat down
I remember one particular night
I was playing the guitar in a little alleyway
Just off of Wardour Street in Soho
And I got busted by the police
This policeman come up and dragged me and my guitar
And my hat full of pennies off to the police station
Anyway, the next day
I had to appear in Marlboro Street Police Court
And it was quite a day
Police officer giving his evidence
I was proceeding in a southernly direction, mi-lord
When I heard strange sounds
Coming from Wardour Place, mi-lord
A sort of boogie woogie music was being played
On further investigation, I saw the defendant
Standing there with a guitar and an old hat
On the floor collecting pennies
Well, I decided that he was contravening
A breach of the peace there, as there was
A traffic jam about five miles long down Wardour Street
Wondering what all the fuss was about
So then I arrested the defendant
Ah, just one moment, officer
Well, what is this boogie woogie music
Here we're talking about?
"Oh, well, mi-lord", said the officer
Getting out his notebook, obviously
Been doing up his homework
It's a kind of jazz-rhythm music
Peculiar to the American-Negro
Oh, and what was the defendant doing
Playing this kind of music there in Wardour street?
Anyway I got off with a caution
A years conditional discharge
But I'll always remember that policeman
And his boogie woogie music
So don't try to lay no boogie woogie
On the king of rock and roll
Don't tell me nothing, don't lies, a woman
'Cause all you know I've told
Don't sell me no alibis, sister
'Cause all you've got I've sold
You better leave at a-midnight slinking
To the one who works it out
I don't want to hear no rackem-tackem squeaking
To go on and shut your mouth
And everything is gonna work out tight
If you ain't like you been told
Just don't try to lay no boogie woogie
On the king of rock and roll
Don't feed me no TV dinners
When you know that I'm used to steak
I don't need no rank beginners
When it's time to shake the shake
You better pull your thing together
'Cause you've been bested out
And if you feel that you just can't dig it
You know you don't know what it's all about
It ain't a matter of par convenience
That's gonna justify your soul
Just don't try to lay no boogie woogie
On the king of rock and roll
Don't try to lay no boogie woogie
On the king of rock and roll
You and I started to drive
So don't pull nothing on me
You didn't arrive til late '45
But your head's in '53
You got what it takes, give your heads a spin
Down by the lonely shack
But you come on just like a fool woman
In the back of a red Cadillac
You can't come across the Upsalquitch
Until you pay the toll
So don't try to lay no boogie woogie
On the king of rock and roll



Well

In this life, I've seen everything I can see, woman
I've seen lovers flying through the air hand in hand
I've seen babies dancing in the midnight sun
And I've seen dreams that came from the heavenly skies above
I've seen old men crying at their own grave sides
And I've seen pigs all sitting watching picture slides
But I never seen nothin' like you

Do ya, do ya want my love? (Woman)
Do ya, do ya want my face? (I need it)
Do ya, do ya want my mind? (I'm sayin')
Do ya, do ya want my love?

Well I heard the crowd singin' out of tune
As they sat and sang 'Auld Lang Syne' by the light of the moon
I heard the preacher bangin' on the drums
And I heard the police playin' with their guns
But I never heard nothing like you
{Bridge}
In the country where the sky touches down on the field
She lay her down to rest in the morning sun
They come a runnin' just to get a look
Just to feel, to touch her long black hair
They don't give a damn

But I never seen nothin' like you

Do ya, do ya want my love? (Woman)
Do ya, do ya want my face? (I need it)
Do ya, do ya want my mind? (I'm sayin')
Do ya, do ya want my love?

Well, I think you know what I'm trying to say, woman
That is, I'd like to save you for a rainy day
I've seen enough of the world to know
That I've got to get it all to get it all to grow

Do ya, do ya want my love? (Come on now)
Do ya, do ya want my face? (I need it)
Do ya, do ya want my mind? (Alright now)
Do ya, do ya want my blood?

Oh, look out
Do ya, do ya want my love?
Do ya, do ya want my love?
Oh-oh



You better you better you bet, ooh
You better you better you bet, ooh
You better you better you bet, ooh
You better you better you bet, ooh

I call you on the telephone
My voice too rough with cigarettes
I sometimes think I should just go home
But I'm dealing with a memory that never forgets
I love to hear you say my name
Especially when you say yes
I got your body right now on my mind
But I drunk myself blind to the sound of old T-Rex (Hmmmm)
To the sound of old T-Rex (oh)  – and Who's Next

When I say I love you you say you better
You better you better you bet
When I say I need you you say you better
You better you better you bet

You better bet your life
Or love will cut you like a knife
I want those feeble minded axes overthrown
I'm not into your passport picture -- I just like your nose
You welcome me with open arms and open legs
I know only fools have needs but this one never begs
I don't really mind how much you love me
Ooh, a little is alright
When you say come over and spend the night
Tonight, tonight

When I say I love you you say you better
You better you better you bet
When I say I need you you say you better
You better you better you bet

You better bet your life
Or love will cut you like a knife

I lay on the bed with you
We could make some book of records
Your dog keeps licking my nose
And chewing up all those letters
Saying "you better"
You better bet your life
You better love me, all the time now
You better shove me back into line now
You better love me, all the time now
You better shove me back into line now


I showed up late one night
With a neon light for a visa
But knowing I am so eager to fight
Can't make letting me in any easier (oooh ooh)
I know I've been wearing crazy clothes
And I look pretty crappy sometime (oooh ooh)
But my body feels so good
And I still sing a razor line every time
And when it comes to all night living
I know what I am giving
I have got it all down to a tee
And it's free

When I say I love you you say you better
You better you better you bet
When I say I need you you say you better
You better you better you bet
When I say I love you you say you better
You better you better you bet
When I say I need you you scream you better (ooh)

You better you better you bet
When I say I love you you say you better
You better you better you bet
When I say I need you you scream you better
You better you better you bet
You better bet your life
Or love will cut you
Just like a knife



Mystery surrounds me and I wonder where I'm going
There's a cloud above me and it seems to hide the way
I'm going straight ahead 'cause it's the only way I know
I wanna leave the past and live just for today
Now then tell me, baby, do you need my love
Tell me, baby, are you thinking of me
Tell me, baby, what it is you need
What kind of satisfaction guaranteed
Sittin' in the gutter with my head wrapped in my hands
I've been drinkin' all night and I just can't stand the pain
It took an awful lot of trouble just to make me understand
Now it's clear to me but will it ever be the same
Now then tell me, baby, do you need my love
Tell me, baby, are you thinking of me
Tell me, baby, what it is you need
What kind of satisfaction guaranteed
Now then tell me, baby, do you need my love
Tell me, baby, are you thinking of me
Tell me, baby, what it is you need
What kind of satisfaction guaranteed
Head upon the highway just as fast as I could go
I rode through the night and halfway through the day
I had no direction, I didn't even want to know where I was going
The only thing I knew was that I had to get away
Now then tell me, baby, do you need my love
Tell me, baby, are you thinking of me
Tell me, baby, what it is you need
What kind of satisfaction guaranteed
Tell me, baby, tell me, baby, tell me, baby, do you need my love
Now that I'm here, yeah, do you need, do you need my love



They like to get you in a compromising position
Well, they like to get you there and smile in your face
Yeah, they think they're so cute when they got you in that condition
But I think it's a total disgrace
And I say
I fight authority, Authority always wins
Well, I fight authority, Authority always wins
Well, I've been doing it since I was a young kid
And I come out grinnin'
Well, I fight authority, Authority always wins
(Oh yeah!)
I call up my preacher
I say, "Give me strength for round 5."
He said, "You don't need no strength, you need to grow up son."
I said, "Growin' up leads to growin' old and then to dyin'
Ooo, and dyin' to me don't sound like all that much fun."
And so I'll say
I fight authority, Authority always wins
Well, I fight authority, Authority always wins
Well, I've been doing it since I was a young kid
I come out grinnin'
Well, I fight authority, Authority always wins
I say: oh no, no no
I say: oh no, no no
I say: oh no, no no no
I fight authority, Authority always wins
I fight authority, Authority always wins (kick it in)
I've been doing it since I was a young kid
And I come out grinnin'
Well, I fight authority, Authority always wins
Well, I fight authority, Authority always wins
Well, I fight authority, Authority always wins
I've been doing it since I was a young kid
And I come out grinnin'

Well I fight authority, authority always wins (Oh no no)
Well I've doing it since I was a young kid (Oh no)
And I come out grinnin' (Oh no)
Well I fight authority and authority always wins



Jet!
Jet!

Jet, I can almost remember their funny faces
That time you told 'em that you were gonna be marrying soon

And Jet, I thought the only lonely place was on the moon

Jet! (ooh)
Jet! (ooh)

Jet, was your father as bold as a Sergeant Major?
Oh, how come he told you that you were hardly old enough yet?

And Jet, I thought the Major was a Lady Suffragette

Jet! (ooh)
Jet! (ooh)
Ah, mater, want Jet to always love me
Ah, mater, want Jet to always love me
Ah, mater, much later

Jet!

And Jet, I thought the Major was a little Lady Suffragette

Jet! (ooh)
Jet! (ooh)

Ah, mater, want Jet to always love me
Ah, mater, want Jet to always love me
Ah, mater, much later

Jet, with the wind in your hair of a thousand laces
Climb on the back, and we'll go for a ride in the sky

And Jet, I thought that the Major was a little Lady Suffragette
Jet! (ooh)
Jet! (ooh)

And Jet, you know I thought you was a little Lady Suffragette

Jet! (ooh)
A little lady
My little lady, yes, oh



It's no use saying that it's alright, it's alright
But where were you after midnight, midnight
Heard a Bang, Bang, Bang; Down they go
It's just a job you do
Cos the harder they run, and the harder they fall
I'm coming down hard on you
Now no-one saw what you looked like, what you looked like
Like a stranger you came out of the night, out of the night
Cos someone put the word on you, and I hope my aim is true
Cos I got a name, and I got a number, I gotta line on you
I got a name, and I got a number, I'm coming after you
Don't keep saying that it's alright, it's alright
It seems you went just a little too far this time
Heard a Bang Bang Bang, and down you go
It's just a job I do
Cos the harder you run the harder you fall
I'm coming down hard on you, hard on you - I hope my aim is true
I got a name, and I got a number, I got a line on you
I got a name, and I got a number, and I'm coming after you
Keep running, Keep running; city to city
Even if you're innocent
You can cause too much embarrassment
And though your heart is breaking
And you know there's no mistaking
Cos you feel your life line breaking (keep running, keep running)
You can feel your hands are shaking (keep running, keep running)
And no-one answers the telephone
You can never never ever go home alone
And though your heart is aching
And you know there's no mistaking
The footsteps close behind
Now don't pretend that you sleep at night, but sleep tight
And can't you feel that the time is right, it's alright
Heard a Bang Bang Bang, and down you go
Oh no-one really cares
Cos the harder you run, and the harder you fall
I'm coming down hard on you, hard on you - I'm hoping that my aim is true
I got a name, and I got a number, I got a line on you
I got a name, and I got a number, I'm coming after you
I got a name, and I got a number, I got a line on you
I got a name, and I got a number, I got a job to do



Manic depression is searching my soul
I know what I want, but I just don't know
How to, go about getting it
Feeling, sweet feeling
Drops from my Fender's, fingers
Manic depression is capturing my soul
Yeah

Woman so willing, the sweet cause in vain
You make love, you break love
It's all the same
When it's, when it's over, mama
Music, sweet music
I wish I could caress, caress, caress
Manic depression is a frustrating mess

Well, I think I'll go turn myself off and go on down
All the way down
Really ain't no use in me hanging around
In your kind of scene
Music, sweet music
I wish I could caress, and kiss, kiss
Manic depression is a frustrating mess



On waves of love my heart is breaking
And stranger still, my self control I can't rely on anymore
New tide, surprise, my world is changing
Within this frame an ocean swells behind the smile, I know it well
Beneath a lover's moon I'm waiting
I am the pilot of the storm, adrift in pleasure I may drown
I built this ship, it is my making
And furthermore, my self control I can't rely on anymore
I know why
I know why
Crazy on a ship of fools
Crazy on a ship of fools
Turn this boat around, back to my loving ground
Oh, no, oh, no
Who claims that no man is an island?
While I land up in jeopardy, more distant from you by degrees
I walk this shore in isolation
And at my feet eternity draws ever sweeter plans for me
I know why
I know why
Crazy on a ship of fools
Ah, crazy on a ship of fools
Turn this boat around, back to my loving ground
Oh, no, oh, no, ship of fools

Turn this boat around, back to my loving ground
Oh, no
Crazy on a ship of fools
Oh, crazy on a ship of fools
Turn this boat around, back to my loving ground
Oh, no, oh, no, ship of fools



May seem peculiar
How I think of you
If you want me, darlin'
Here's what you must do
You gotta give me
'Cause I can't give the best
Unless I got room to move
If you want me darlin'
Take me how you can
I'll be circulatin'
'Cause that's the way I am
You gotta give me
'Cause I can't give the best
Unless I got room to move



There I was with the old man
Stranded again so off I'd ran
A young world crashing around me
No possibilities of getting what I need
He looked at me and smiled
Said "No, no, no, no, no child
See the dog and butterfly. Up in the
Air he like to fly." Dog and butterfly
Below she had to try. She roll back down
To the warm soft ground laughing
She don't know why, she don't know why
Dog and butterfly
Well I stumbled upon your secret place
Safe in the trees you had tears on your face
Wrestling with your desires frozen strangers
Stealing your fires. The message hit my mind
Only words that I could find
See the dog and butterfly
Up in the air he like to fly
Dog and butterfly below she had to try
She roll back down to the warm soft ground
Laughing to the sky, up to the sky
Dog and butterfly
We're getting older the world's getting colder
For the life of me I don't know the reason why
Maybe it's livin' making us give in
Hearts rolling in taken back on the tide
We're balanced together ocean upon the sky
Another night in this strange town
Moonlight holding me light as down
Voice of confusion inside of me
Just begging to go back where I'm free
Feels like I'm through
Then the old man's words are true
See the dog and butterfly
Up in the air he like to fly
Dog and butterfly, below she had to try
She roll back down to the warm soft
Ground with a little tear in her eye
She had to try, she had to try
Dog and butterfly
Yeah
Up in the air, he liked to fly
The dog and butterfly, below she had to try
She rolled back down to the warm soft ground
Laughing she don't know why
But she had to try she had to try
Dog and butterfly



Your love is fadin', I feel it fade
Ah, your love is fadin', I feel it fade
Ah, your love is fadin', woman I feel it fade

Ah, woman, woman your touch, your touch has gone cold
As if someone else controls your very soul
I've fooled myself long as I can
Can feel the presence of another man
It's there when you speak my name
It's just not the same
Ooh babe, I'm losing you
It's in the air
It's there everywhere
Baby, baby, babe, I'm losing you

When I look into your eyes
A reflection of a face, I see
I'm hurt, down-hearted and worried, girl
'Cause that face doesn't belong to me
It's all over your face
Someone's takin' my place
Ooh baby, I'm losing you
You try hard to hide
The emptiness you feel inside
Ooh babe, I'm losing you
I can't bear the thought of losing you
Ah woman, can't you see what I'm goin' through
I'm losin' my mind, losin' my mind
And it's all because of you
I can't bear the thought of losing you
I'm losin' my mind, losin' my mind
And it's all because of you
I can't stand the thought of losing you



Well, we all need someone we can lean on
And if you want it, well, you can lean on me
Yeah, we all need someone we can lean on
And if you want it, well, you can lean on me

She said, "My breasts, they will always be open
Baby, you can rest your weary head right on me
And there will always be a space in my parking lot
When you need a little coke and sympathy"

Yeah, we all need someone we can dream on
And if you want it, baby, well, you can dream on me
Yeah, we all need someone we can cream on, yeah
And if you want to, well, you can cream on me

I was dreaming of a steel guitar engagement
When you drunk my health in scented jasmine tea
But you knifed me in my dirty, filthy basement
With that jaded, faded, junky nurse - oh, what pleasant company Ha!

Come on, we all need someone we can feed on
Yeah, and if you want it, well, you can feed on me
Hey, take my arm, take my leg
Oh baby, don't you take my head
Woo
Yeah, we all need someone we can bleed on
Yeah, and if you want it, baby, well, you can bleed on me
Yeah, we all need someone we can bleed on
Yeah yeah, and if you want it, baby, why don't you bleed on me ? (All over, woo!)

Yeah

(Come on, babe)
Ah, get it on rider, woo, get it on rider, get it on rider
You can bleed all over me, yeah
Get it on rider, woo, get it on rider, yeah
You can be my rider, you can come all over me, oh
Get it on rider, babe, get it on rider, get it on rider
You can come all over me
Yeah...
Come on, get it on, rider, let it come all over me
Yeah, yeah...
Get it on, rider
Get it on, rider

Well, Billy rapped all night about his suicide
How he'd kick it in the head when he was twenty-five
Speed jive, don't want to stay alive
When you're twenty-five
And Wendy's stealing clothes from Marks & Sparks
And Freddy's got spots from ripping off the stars from his face
Funky little boat race
Television man is crazy saying we're juvenile delinquent wrecks
Oh, Man, I need TV when I've got T.Rex
Oh brother, you guessed
I'm a dude, dad

All the young dudes (Hey dudes!)
Carry the news (Where are you?)
Boogaloo dudes (Stand up, c'mon)
Carry the news
All the young dudes (I want to hear you)
Carry the news (I want to see you)
Boogaloo dudes (I want to talk to you, all of you)
Carry the news (Nowwww)

Now Lucy looks sweet cause he dresses like a queen
But he can kick like a mule, it's a real mean team
But we can love
Oh yes, we can love
And my brother's back at home with his Beatles and his Stones
We never got it off on that revolution stuff
What a drag, too many snags
Now I've drunk a lot of wine and I'm feeling fine
Got to race some cat to bed
Oh is that concrete all around
Or is it in my head?
Yeah
I'm a dude, dad
All the young dudes (Hey dudes)
Carry the news (Where are you?)
Boogaloo dudes (Stand up)
Carry the news (ha ha)
All the young dudes (I want to hear you)

Carry the news



You might think I'm crazy to hang around with you
Maybe you think I'm lucky to have something to do
But I think that you're wild
Inside me is some child

You might think I'm foolish
Or maybe it's untrue (you might think)
You might think I'm crazy (but all I want)
But all I want is you

You might think it's hysterical, but I know when you're weak
You think you're in the movies, and everything's so deep
But I think that you're wild
When you flash that fragile smile

You might think it's foolish
What you put me through (you might think)
You might think I'm crazy (but all I want)
All I want is you

And it was hard, so hard to take
There's no escape without a scrape
But you kept it going till the sun fell down
You kept it going
Well, you might think I'm delirious the way I run you down
But somewhere sometimes, when you're curious, I'll be back around
Oh, I think that you're wild
And so uniquely styled

You might think it's foolish
This chancy rendezvous
You might think I'm crazy (but all I want)
But all I want is you
All I want is you
All I want is you



Well, the first days are the hardest days
Don't you worry anymore
'Cause when life looks like Easy Street
There is danger at your door
Think this through with me
Let me know your mind
Woah, oh, what I want to know
Is are you kind?
It's a buck dancer's choice my friend
Better take my advice
You know all the rules by now
And the fire from the ice
Will you come with me?
Won't you come with me?
Woah, oh, what I want to know
Will you come with me?
Goddamn, well, I declare
Have you seen the like
Their walls are built of cannon balls
Their motto is don't tread on me
Come hear Uncle John's Band
Playing to the tide
Come with me or go alone
He's come to take his children home
It's the same story the crow told me
It's the only one he know
Like the morning sun you come
And like the wind you go
Ain't no time to hate
Barely time to wait
Woah, oh, what I want to know
Where does the time go?
I live in a silver mine
And I call it "Beggar's Tomb"
I got me a violin
And I beg you call the tune
Anybody's choice
I can hear your voice
Whoa-ho what I want to know
How does the song go?
Come hear Uncle John's Band
By the riverside
Got some things to talk about
Here beside the rising tide
Come hear Uncle John's Band
Playing to the tide
Come on along or go alone
He's come to take his children home
Whoa-ho what I want to know
How does the song go?
Come hear Uncle John's Band
By the riverside
Got some things to talk about
Here beside the rising tide
Come hear Uncle John's Band
Playing to the tide
Come on along or go alone
He's come to take his children home
Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh (To fade)
Songwriters:  Jerry Garcia and Robert Hunter



In this dirty old part of the city
Where the sun refused to shine
People tell me there ain't no use in tryin'
Now, my girl, you're so young and pretty
And one thing I know is true
You'll be dead before your time is due, I know
Watch my daddy in bed a-dyin'
Watched his hair been turnin' grey, yeah
He's been workin' and slavin' his life away
Oh yes, I know it

Believe me, baby, I know it, baby
You know it too



Leah
It's been a long, long time
You're such a sight
You're looking better than a body has a right to
Don't you know we're playing with the fire
But we can stop this burning desire
Leah
Ah! Leah!
Here we go again
Ah! Leah!
Is it ever gonna end?
Ah! Leah!
Here we go again
Ah! Leah!
I see your lips
And I wonder who's been kissing them
I never knew how badly I was missing them
We both know we're never going to make it
But when we touch
We never have to fake it
Leah
Ah! Leah!
Here we go again
Ah! Leah!
Is it ever gonna end?
Ah! Leah!
Here we go again
Ah! Leah!
We ain't learned our lesson yet
Baby, it's no good
We're just asking for trouble
I can touch you
But I don't know how to love you
It ain't no use
We're headed for disaster
Our minds said no
But our hearts were talking faster
Leah
Ah! Leah!
Here we go again
Ah! Leah!
Here we go again
Ah! Leah!
Leah, Leah, Leah
Ah! Leah!
Here we go again
Ah! Leah!
Leah
We're never, ever, ever gonna make it, yeah
Ah! Leah!
Here we go again
Ah! Leah!
We're never gonna make it
Ah! Leah!



Lord, I was born a ramblin' man
Tryin' to make a livin' and doin' the best I can
And when it's time for leavin', I hope you'll understand
That I was born a ramblin' man

Well, my father was a gambler down in Georgia
And he wound up on the wrong end of gun
And I was born in the back seat of a Greyhound bus
Rollin' down Highway 41

Lord, I was born a ramblin' man
Tryin' to make a livin' and doin' the best I can
When it's time for leavin', I hope you'll understand
That I was born a ramblin' man

All right!

I'm on my way to New Orleans this mornin'
Leaving out of Nashville, Tennessee
They're always having a good time down on the bayou
Lord, and Delta women think the world of me
Lord, I was born a ramblin' man
Tryin' to make a livin' and doin' the best I can
And when it's time for leavin', I hope you'll understand
That I was born a ramblin' man

Lord, I was born a ramblin' man
Lord, I was born a ramblin' man
Lord, I was born a ramblin' man
Lord, I was born a ramblin' man



Hey
That's right

Asked sweet mama, let me be her kid
She said, "You might get hurt if you don't keep it hid"
Well, I know my baby if I see her in the dark
I said, I know my rider if I see her in the dark

Now, I'm going to Rosedale, take my rider by my side
Still barrel house, but it's on the riverside, yeah
I know my baby, Lord, I said, is really sloppy drunk
I know my mama, Lord, a brown-skin, but she ain't no plum
Uh-huh, see my baby, tell her, tell her hurry home
Had no loving since my baby been gone
See my baby, tell her hurry on home
I ain't had, Lord, my right mind
Since my rider's been gone
Hey, she promises, she's my rider
I want to tell you, she's my rider
I know you're mine, she's my rider
She ain't but sixteen, but she's my rider
I'm going to Rosedale, take my rider by my side
Anybody ask if you and me met, I keep them satisfied
But, uh, see my baby, tell her, tell her to shake my milk
Ain't no Lord since you nowhere
Ah, yeah
Won't you come in my kitchen

She's a kindhearted lady
She studies evil all the time
She's a kindhearted woman
She studies evil all the time
Squeeze my lemon 'til the juice runs down my leg
Squeeze it so hard, I'll fall right out of bed
Squeeze my lemon
'til the juice runs down my leg
I wonder if you know what I'm talking about
Oh, but the way that you squeeze it girl
I swear I'm going to  fall right out of bed

Ah, she's a good rider
She's my kindhearted lady
I'm going to take my rider by my side, yeah
I said her front teeth are lined with gold
She's got a mortgage on my body, got a lien on my soul
She's my brown-skin sugar plum



Now, warning lights are flashing down at Quality Control
Somebody threw a spanner, and they threw him in the hole
There's rumors in the loading bay and anger in the town
Somebody blew the whistle and the walls came down
There's a meeting in the boardroom
They're trying to trace the smell
There's a leaking in the washroom, there's a sneak in personnel
Somewhere in the corridors, someone was heard to sneeze
Goodness me, could this be industrial disease?

The caretaker was crucified for sleeping at his post
They're refusing to be pacified, it's him they blame the most
The watchdog's got rabies, the foreman's got the fleas
Everyone's concerned about industrial disease
There's panic on the switchboard, tongues in knots
Some come out in sympathy, some come out in spots
Some blame the management, some the employees
And everybody knows it's the industrial disease

Yeah, now the work force is disgusted downs tools and walks
Innocence is injured, experience just talks
Everyone seeks damages and everyone agrees
That these are "classic symptoms of a monetary squeeze"
On ITV and BBC they talk about the curse
Philosophy is useless, theology is worse
History boils over, there's an economics freeze
Sociologists invent words that mean "industrial disease"
Doctor Parkinson declared "I'm not surprised to see you here
You've got smoker's cough from smoking
Brewer's droop from drinking beer
I don't know how you came to get the Betty Davis' knees
But, worst of all young man you've got industrial disease"
He wrote me a prescription he said "You are depressed
I'm glad you came to see me to get this off your chest
Come back and see me later, next patient please
Send in another victim of industrial disease, ha-ha
Ha, splendid!"

And I go down to Speaker's Corner I'm-a thunderstruck
They got free speech, tourists, police in trucks
Two men say they're Jesus, one of them must be wrong
There's a protest singer, he's singing a protest song, he says
"They want to have a war to keep their factories
They want to have a war to keep us on our knees
They want to have a war to stop us buying Japanese
They want to have a war to stop Industrial Disease

They're pointing out the enemy to keep you deaf and blind
They want to sap your energy incarcerate your mind
Give you Rule Brittania, gassy beer, page three
Two weeks in Espana and Sunday striptease"
Meanwhile the first Jesus says "I'd cure it soon
Abolish Monday mornings and Friday afternoons"
The other one's out on hunger strike, he's dying by degrees
How come Jesus gets industrial disease?



Come down off your throne and leave your body alone
Somebody must change
You are the reason I've been waiting so long
Somebody holds the key

But I'm near the end and I just ain't got the time
And I'm wasted and I can't find my way home

Come down on your own and leave your body alone
Somebody must change
You are the reason I've been waiting all these years
Somebody holds the key

But I'm near the end and I just ain't got the time
And I'm wasted and I can't find my way home

But I can't find my way home
But I can't find my way home
But I can't find my way home
But I can't find my way home
Still I can't find my way home
And I ain't done nothing wrong
But I can't find my way home



If I hear you knocking hard up on my door
Ain't no way that I'm gonna answer it
'Cos cheating is one thing and lying is another
And when I say it's over that's it I'm gonna quit, yeah
Now I ain't complaining, just tryin' to understand
What makes a woman do the things she does?
One day she'll love you the next day she'll leave you
Why can't we have it just the way it used to be?
Why can't we have it, baby?
'Cos I'm a man, I got my pride
Don't need no woman to hurt me inside
I need a love like any other
So go on and leave me, leave me for another
Good lovin' gone bad
Good lovin' gone bad, bad, bad
Good lovin' gone bad
And baby, I'm a bad man
Now I'm a man, I got my pride
Don't need no woman to hurt me inside
I need a love like any other
So go on and leave me, leave me for another
Good lovin' gone bad
Good lovin' gone bad
Good lovin' gone bad
And baby, I'm a bad man
Good lovin' gone bad
Good lovin' gone bad
Good lovin' gone bad; I'm a sad man
Don't stand in my way 'cause baby, I'm a bad man



Raised to be a lady by the golden rule
Alice was the spawn of a public school
With a double barrel name in the back of her brain
And a simple case of mummy-doesn't-love-me blues
Reality it seems was just a dream
She couldn't get it on with the boys on the scene

But what do you expect from a chick who's just sixteen
And hey, hey, hey (hey, hey, hey)
You know what I mean

All the young girls love Alice
Tender young Alice, they say
Come over and see me
Come over and please me
Alice, it's my turn today
All the young girls love Alice
Tender young Alice they say
If I give you my number
Will you promise to call me?
Wait till my husband's away

Poor little darling with a chip out of her heart
It's like acting in a movie when you got the wrong part
Getting your kicks in another girl's bed
And it was only last Tuesday
Oh, they found you in the subway dead
And who could you call your friends down in SoHo
One or two middle-aged dykes in a go-go
But what do you expect from a 16-year-old yo-yo?
And hey, hey, hey (hey, hey, hey)
Oh, don’t you know?

All the young girls love Alice
Tender young Alice, they say
Come over and see me
Come over and please me
Alice, it's my turn today
All the young girls love Alice
Tender young Alice, they'd say
If I give you my number
Will you promise to call me?
Wait till my husband's away



I pulled in to Nazareth
Was feeling 'bout half past dead
I just need some place
Where I can lay my head
"Hey, mister, can you tell me
Where a man might find a bed?"
He just grinned and shook my hand
And "No" was all he said

Take a load off Fanny
Take a load for free
Take a load off Fanny
And (and, and) you put the load right on me
(You put the load right on me)

I picked up my bag
I went looking for a place to hide
When I saw Carmen and the Devil
Walking side by side
I said "Hey Carmen, come on
Let's go downtown?"
And she said, "I gotta go
But my friend can stick around"
And take a load off Fanny
Take a load for free
Take a load off Fanny
And (and, and) you put the load right on me
(You put the load right on me)

Go down, Miss Moses, there's nothin' you can say
It's just ol' Luke, and Luke's waitin' on the Judgement Day
"Well, Luke, my friend, what about young Anna Lee?"
He said, "Do me a favor, son, won't ya stay and keep Anna Lee company?"

And take a load off Fanny
Take a load for free
Take a load off Fanny
And (and, and) you put the load right on me
(You put the load right on me)

Crazy Chester followed me, and he caught me in the fog
He said, "I will fix your rack, if you'll take Jack, my dog."
I said, "Wait a minute, Chester, you know I'm a peaceful man."
He said, "That's okay, boy, won't you feed him when you can."
And take a load off Fanny
Take a load for free
Take a load off Fanny
And (and, and) you put the load right on me
(You put the load right on me)

Catch a Cannonball, now, to take me down the line
My bag is sinkin' low and I do believe it's time
To get back to Miss Fanny, you know she's the only one
Who sent me here with her regards for everyone

Take a load off Fanny
Take a load for free
Take a load off Fanny
And (and, and) you put the load right on me
(You put the load right on me)



Doo doo doo-doo doo doo-doo doo
Doo doo doo-doo doo doo-doo doo
Doo doo doo-doo doo doo-doo doo

You've got your mother in a whirl
She's not sure if you're a boy or a girl
Hey, babe, your hair's alright
Hey, babe, let's go out tonight
You like me and I like it all
We like dancing and we look divine
You love bands when they're playing hard
You want more and you want it fast

They put you down, they say I'm wrong
You tacky thing, you put them on

Rebel Rebel, you've torn your dress
Rebel Rebel, your face is a mess
Rebel Rebel, how could they know?
Hot tramp, I love you so
{Bridge}
Don't ya?
Doo doo doo-doo doo doo-doo doo
You've got your mother in a whirl
'Cause she's not sure if you're a boy or a girl
Hey, babe, your hair's alright
Hey, babe, let's stay out tonight
You like me and I like it all
We like dancing and we look divine
You love bands when they're playing hard
You want more and you want it fast

They put you down, they say I'm wrong
You tacky thing, you put them on

Rebel Rebel, how could they know?
Hot tramp, I love you so (don't ya?)


You've torn your dress, your face is a mess
You can't get enough, but enough ain't the test
You've got your transmission and your live wire
You got your cue line and a handful of ludes
You wanna be there when they count up the dudes
And I love your dress
You're a juvenile success
Because your face is a mess
So how could they know?
I said, how could they know?
So what you wanna know?
Calamity's child, chi-chi, chi-chi
Where'd you wanna go?
What can I do for you? Looks like I've been there too
'Cause you've torn your dress
And your face is a mess
Ooh, your face is a mess
Ooh, ooh, so how could they know?
Ah, ah, how could they know?
Ah, ah



When Black Friday comes
I'll stand down by the door
And catch the grey men when they
Dive from the fourteenth floor
When Black Friday comes
I'll collect everything I'm owed
And before my friends find out
I'll be on the road

When Black Friday falls
You know it's got to be
Don't let it fall on me
When Black Friday comes
I'll fly down to Muswellbrook
Gonna strike all the big red words
From my little black book
Gonna do just what I please
Gonna wear no socks and shoes
With nothing to do but feed
All the kangaroos

When Black Friday comes
I'll be on that hill
You know I will

When Black Friday comes
I'm gonna dig myself a hole
Gonna lay down in it
'til I satisfy my soul
Gonna let the world pass by me
The Archbishop's gonna sanctify me
And if he don't come across
I'm gonna let it roll

When Black Friday comes
I'm gonna stake my claim
I'll guess I'll change my name



Nothing is easy
Though times get you worried
My friend, it's OK
Just take your life easy
And stop all that hurrying
Be happy my way
When tension starts mounting
And you've lost count
Of the pennies you've missed
Just try hard and see why they're not worrying me
They're last on my list
Nothing's easy
Nothing is easy, you'll find
That the squeeze won't turn out so bad
Your fingers may freeze, worse things happen at sea
There's good times to be had
So if you're alone and you're down to the bone
Just give us a play
You'll smile in a while and discover
That I'll get you happy my way
Nothing's easy



Everybody's trying to say I'm wrong
I just want to be back where I belong

World turning
I got to get my feet back on the ground
World turning
Everybody's got me down

Maybe I'm wrong but who's to say what's right
I need somebody to help me through the night

World turning
I got to get my feet back on the ground
World turning
Everybody's got me down

Maybe I'm wrong but who's to say what's right
I need somebody to help me through the night

World turning
I got to get my feet back on the ground
World turning
Everybody's got me down
Umm turning
Everybody's got me down
World turning
Everybody's got me down



I know you want to leave me
But I refuse to let you go
If I have to beg, plead for your sympathy
I don't mind because you mean that much to me

Ain't too proud to beg and you know it
Please don't leave me girl, don't you go
Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me girl, don't you go

Now I heard a quiet man is half a man
With no sense of pride
But if I have to cry to keep you I don't mind weeping
If it will keep you by my side


If I have to sleep on your door step all night and day
Just to keep you from walking away
Let your friends laugh, even this I can stand
Because I want to keep you anywhere I can

Now I've got a love so deep in the pit of my heart
And each day it grows more and more
I'm not ashamed to come and plead with you, baby
If pleading keeps you from walking out the door



Well I've heard lots of people say
They're going to settle down
You don't see their faces
And they don't come around
Well I'm not that way
I got to move along
I like to drink and to dance all night
Comes to a fix not afraid to fight

You got that right
Said, you got that right
Sure got that right

Seems so long I been out on my own
Travel light and I'm always alone
Guess I was born with a travellin' bone
When my times up, I'll hold my own
You won't find me in an old folks home

You got that right
Said you got that right
Well, you got that right
Sure got that right
I tried everything in my life
Things I like I try 'em twice


Travelling around the world, just singing my song
I got to go, Lord I can't stay long
Here comes that ol' travelling jones once again
I like to drink and to dance all night
Comes to a fix not afraid to fight



I like the way your sparkling earrings lay
Against your skin so brown
And I want to sleep with you in the desert tonight
With a billion stars all around

'Cause I got a peaceful easy feelin'
And I know you won't let me down
'Cause I'm already standin'
On the ground

And I found out a long time ago
What a woman can do to your soul
Aw but she can't take you any way
You don't already know how to go

And I got a peaceful easy feelin'
And I know you won't let me down
'Cause I'm already standin'
On the ground

I get this feelin' I may know you
As a lover and a friend
This voice keeps whisperin' in my other ear
Tells me I may never see you again

'Cause I get a peaceful easy feelin'
And I know you won't let me down
'Cause I'm already standin'
I'm already standin'
Yes I'm already standin'
On the ground

Whoo oh ooh



Love hurts, love scars
Love wounds and marks
Any heart
Not tough or strong enough
To take a lot of pain, take a lot of pain
Love is like a cloud
Holds a lot of rain
Love hurts
Ooh, ooh love hurts

I'm young, I know, but even so
I know a thing or two
I learned from you
I really learned a lot, really learned a lot
Love is like a flame
It burns you when it's hot
Love hurts
Ooh, ooh love hurts

Some fools think of happiness
Blissfulness, togetherness
Some fools fool themselves, I guess
They're not foolin' me
I know it isn't true
I know it isn't true
Love is just a lie
Made to make you blue
Love hurts
Ooh, ooh love hurts
Ooh, ooh love hurts


I know it isn't true
I know it isn't true
Love is just a lie
Made to make you blue
Love hurts
Ooh, ooh love hurts
Ooh, ooh love hurts
Ooh, ooh...



You're not shy, you get around
You want to fly, don't want your feet on the ground
You stay up, you won't come down
You want to live, you want to move to the sound

Got fire in your veins
Burning hot but you don't feel the pain
Your desire is insane
You can't stop until you do it again

But sometimes I wonder as I look in your eyes
Maybe you're thinking of some other guy
But I know, yes I know, how to treat you right
That's why you call me in the middle of the night

You say it's urgent
So urgent, so oh oh urgent
Just wait and see
How urgent my love can be
It's urgent

You play tricks on my mind
You're everywhere but you're so hard to find
You're not warm or sentimental
You're so extreme, you can be so temperamental
But I'm not looking for a love that will last
I know what I need and I need it fast
Yeah, there's one thing in common that we both share
That's a need for for each other anytime, anywhere

It gets so urgent
So urgent
You know it's urgent
I want to tell you it's the same for me
So urgent
Just you wait and see
How urgent our love can be
It's urgent

You say it's urgent
Make it fast, make it urgent
Do it quick, do it urgent
Got to rush, make it urgent
Want it quick
Urgent, urgent, emergency

So urgent, emergency
Emer... emer... emer...
It's urgent



{Instrumental}
I never read it in a book
I never saw it on a show
But I heard it in the alley
On a weird radio
If you want a drink of water
You got to get it from a well
If you want to get to heaven
You got to raise a little hell
I never felt it in my feet
I never felt it in my soul
But I heard it in the alley
Now it's in my rock and roll
If you want to know a secret
You got to promise not to tell
If you want to get to heaven
You got to raise a little hell
{Instrumental}
I never thought it'd be so easy
I never thought it'd be so fun
But I heard it in the alley
Now I got it on the run
If you want to see an angel
You got to find it where it fell
If you want to get to heaven
You got to raise a little hell
{Instrumental}
If you want to get to heaven
If you want to get to heaven
If you want to get to heaven
If you want to get to heaven



Shadows grow so long before my eyes
And they're moving across the page
Suddenly, the day turns into night
Far away from the city

Don't hesitate
'Cause your love won't wait

Ooh, baby, I love your way
Wanna tell you I love your way
Wanna be with you night and day, ay

Moon appears to shine and light the sky
With the help of some fireflies
I wonder how they have the power to shine, shine, shine
I can see them under the pine

But don't hesitate
'Cause your love won't wait, yeah

Ooh, baby, I love your way
Wanna tell you I love your way
Wanna be with you night and day
Well, don't, don't hesitate
'Cause your love won't wait

I can see the sunset in your eyes
Brown and gray, blue besides
Clouds are stalking islands in the sun
I wish I could buy one
Out of season

But don't hesitate
'Cause your love won't wait, oh

Ooh, baby, I love your way
Wanna tell you I love your way
Wanna be with you night and day
Ooh, baby, I love your way



It's been a long time comin'
It's goin' to be a long time gone
And it appears to be a long
Appears to be a long
Appears to be a long time
Yes, a long, long, long, long time before the dawn
Turn, turn any corner
Hear, you must hear what the people say
You know there's something that's goin' on around here
That surely, surely, surely won't stand the light of day, no
And it appears to be a long (yes it does)
Appears to be a long (mm)
Appears to be a long time
Such a long, long time before the dawn
Speak out, you got to speak out against the madness
You got to speak your mind, if you dare
But don't—no, don't no—try to get yourself elected
If you do you had better cut your hair, mm
And it appears to be a long (yes it does)
Appears to be a long (mm)
Appears to be a long time
Such a long, long, long, long time before the dawn
It's been a (long) long (time) time (comin') comin'
It's going to be (long) a long (time) time (gone) gone
But you know the darkest hour
Is always, always just before the dawn
And it appears to be a long
Appears to be a long
Appears to be a long time
Such a long, long, long, long time before the dawn



The screen door slams, Mary's dress sways
Like a vision, she dances across the porch as the radio plays
Roy Orbison singing for the lonely
Hey, that's me, and I want you only
Don't turn me home again
I just can't face myself alone again
Don't run back inside
Darling, you know just what I'm here for
So you're scared, and you're thinking
That maybe we ain't that young anymore
Show a little faith, there's magic in the night
You ain't a beauty, but, hey, you're alright
Oh, and that's alright with me
You can hide 'neath your covers and study your pain
Make crosses from your lovers, throw roses in the rain
Waste your summer praying in vain
For a saviour to rise from these streets
Well now, I'm no hero, that's understood
All the redemption I can offer, girl, is beneath this dirty hood
With a chance to make it good somehow
Hey what else can we do now?
Except roll down the window and let the wind blow back your hair
Well the night's busting open
These two lanes will take us anywhere
We got one last chance to make it real
To trade in these wings on some wheels
Climb in back, heaven's waiting down on the tracks
Oh-oh come take my hand
We're riding out tonight to case the promised land
Oh-oh Thunder Road oh Thunder Road oh Thunder Road
Lying out there like a killer in the sun
Hey, I know it's late, we can make it if we run
Oh, Thunder Road, sit tight, take hold
Thunder Road
Well I got this guitar, and I learned how to make it talk
And my car's out back if you're ready to take that long walk
From your front porch to my front seat
The door's open but the ride it ain't free
And I know you're lonely for words that I ain't spoken
But tonight we'll be free, all the promises'll be broken
There were ghosts in the eyes of all the boys you sent away
They haunt this dusty beach road
In the skeleton frames of burned out Chevrolets
They scream your name at night in the street
Your graduation gown lies in rags at their feet
And in the lonely cool before dawn
You hear their engines roaring on
But when you get to the porch they're gone on the wind
So Mary, climb in
It's a town full of losers
And I'm pulling out of here to win



You know, every now and then
I think you might like to hear something from us
Nice and easy but there's just one thing
You see, we never ever do nothing nice and easy
We always do it nice and rough
So we're going to take the beginning of this song
And do it easy
Then we're going to do the finish rough
This is the way we do 'Proud Mary'

Left a good job in the city
Working for the man every night and day
And I never lost one minute of sleeping
Worrying 'bout the way that things might have been

Big wheel keep on turning
Proud Mary keep on burning
And we're rolling, rolling
Rolling on the river
Listen to the story

Left a good job in the city
Working for the man every night and day
And I never lost one minute of sleeping
Worrying 'bout the way that things might have been
Big wheel keep on turning
Proud Mary keep on burning
And we're rolling, rolling
Rolling yeah
Rolling
Rolling on the river
Rolling on the river

Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis
Ya know I pumped a lot of 'tane down in New Orleans
But I never saw the good side of the city
Until I hitched a ride on the riverboat queen

Ya know the big wheel keep on turning
Proud Mary keep on burning
And we're rolling (Rolling)
Rolling yeah (Rolling)
Rolling on the river (Rolling on the river)
Said we're rolling (Rolling)
Rolling yeah (Rolling)
Rolling on the river (Rolling on the river)

Oh I left a good job in the city
Working for the man every night and day
And I never lost one minute of sleeping
Worrying 'bout the way that things might have been
Big wheel keep on turning (Turning)
Proud Mary keep on burning (Burning)
Rolling, rolling, rolling on the river
We're rolling, rolling, rolling on the river

We're up
Do do do do do do do do do do
Alright

Oh I cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis
And I pumped a lot of 'tane down in New Orleans
But I never saw the good side of the city
'Til I hitched a ride on the riverboat queen

Big wheel keep on turning (Turning)
Proud Mary keep on burning (Burning)
We're rolling, said we're rolling, we're rolling on the river
I'll tell ya we're rolling, rolling, rolling on the river

We're up

Alright

And you don't have to worry if you got no money
People on the river are happy to give

Big wheel keep on turning (Turning)
Proud Mary keep on burning (Burning)
And we're rolling, and we're rolling, and we're rolling on the river
Tell me one more time rolling, (Yeah)
Rolling, rolling on the river (All right, ooo yeah)

Get your party gown, get your pigtail down
Get your heart beating, baby
Got my timing right, got my act all tight
It's gotta be tonight
My little school babe
Your momma says you don't
And your daddy says you won't
And I'm boiling up inside
There is no way I'm gonna lose out this time
Oh, no

Tie your mother down
Tie your mother down
Lock your daddy out of doors
I don't need him nosing around
Tie your mother down
Tie your mother down
Give me all your love tonight
"You're such a dirty louse
Go get out of my house"
That's all I ever get from your
Your family ties, in fact
I don't think I ever heard
A single little civil word from those guys
But you know I don't give a light
I'm gonna make out all right
I've got a sweetheart in hand
To put a stop to all that
Snipin' and grousin' goin' on all night
Tie your mother down
Tie your mother down
Send your little brother
Swimming with a brick, that's alright
Tie your mother down
Tie your mother down
Or you ain't no friend of mine

Bad guy

Your mommy and your daddy
Are gonna plague me till I die
They can't understand it
I'm just a peace loving guy
Tie your mother down
Tie your mother down
Get that big, big, big, big, big
Big daddy out the door
Tie your mother down
Yeah, tie your mother down
Give me all your love tonight
All your love tonight
Give me every inch of your love
Gotta get my timing right
All your love tonight, yeah
All your love
Tonight



I would climb any mountain
Sail across a stormy sea
If that's what it takes me, baby
To show you how much you mean to me

And I guess it's just the woman in you
That brings out the man in me
I know I can't help myself
You're all in the world to me

(It feels like the first time)
(Feels like the very first time)
(It feels like the first time)
(It feels like the very first time)

I have waited a lifetime
Spent my time so foolishly
But now that I've found you
Together we'll make history
And I know that it must be the woman in you
That brings out the man in me
I know I can't help myself
You're all that my eyes can see

And it feels like the first time
Like it never did before
Feels like the first time
Like we've opened up the door
Feels like the first time
Like it never will again
Never again

(Feels like the first time)
It feels like the first time
(It feels like the very first time)
Very first, feels
(It feels like the first time)
Oh, it feels like the first time
(Feels like the very first time)

Open up the door
Won't you open up the door? Yeah
(Feels like the first time)
(And it feels like the very first time)
(And it feels like the very first time)
(It feels like the very first time)

(And it feels like the first time)
(It feels like the very first time)
Oh, it feels
(Feels like the first time)
Yeah, it feels like the first time
(Feels like the very first time)



Nobody going to take my car
I'm going to race it to the ground
Nobody going to beat my car
It's going to break the speed of sound
Ooh, it's a killing machine
It's got everything
Like a driving power
Big fat tires and everything

I love it
And I need it
I bleed it
Yeah, it's a wild hurricane

Alright, hold tight
I'm a highway star

Nobody going to take my girl
I'm going to keep her to the end
Nobody going to have my girl
She stays close on every bend
Ooh, she's a killing machine
She's got everything
Like a moving mouth
Body control and everything
I love her
I need her
I see her
Yeah, she turns me on

Alright, hold tight
I'm a highway star


Nobody going to take my head
I got speed inside my brain
Nobody going to steal my head
Now that I'm on the road again
Ooh, I'm in heaven again
I've got everything
Like a moving ground
An open road and everything

I love it
And I need it
I seed it
Eight cylinders, all mine
Alright, hold tight
I'm a highway star


Nobody going to take my car
I'm going to race it to the ground
Nobody going to beat my car
It's going to break the speed of sound
Ooh, it's a killing machine
It's got everything
Like a driving power
Big fat tires and everything

I love it
And I need it
I bleed it
Yeah, it's a mad hurricane

Alright, hold tight
I'm a highway star
I'm a highway star
I'm a highway star



I used to hurry a lot, I used to worry a lot
I used to stay out till the break of day
Oh, that didn't get it
It was high time I quit it
I just couldn't carry on that way

Oh, I did some damage
I know it's true
Didn't know I was so lonely
Till I found you

You can go the distance
We'll find out
In the long run (In the long run)
We can handle some resistance
If our love is a strong one (Is a strong one)

People talking about us
They got nothin' else to do
When it all comes down
We will still come through
In the long run
Ooh, I want to tell you
It's a long run

You know I don't understand
Why you don't treat yourself better
Do the crazy things that you do
Cause all the debutantes in Houston, baby
Couldn't hold a candle to you

Did you do it for love?
Did you do it for money?
Did you do it for spite?
Did you think you had to, honey?

Who is gonna make it?
We'll find out
In the long run (In the long run)
I know we can take it
If our love is a strong one (Is a strong one)

Well, we're scared
But we ain't shakin'
Kinda bent
But we ain't breakin'
In the long run
Ooh, I want to tell you
It's a long run
In the long run
In the long run

Gonna find out, ooh fa-fa-fa-find out
Long-long-long-long, long-long-long-long
Ooh, run-run-run, baby, run-run, baby
Long, long, long, long



Crossroads, seem to come and go, yeah
The gypsy flies from coast to coast
Knowing many, loving none
Bearing sorrow having fun
But back home he'll always run
To sweet Melissa

Freight train, each car looks the same, all the same
And no one knows the Gypsy's name
No one hears his lonely sighs
There are no blankets where he lies
In all his deepest dreams the Gypsy flies
With sweet Melissa

Again the morning's come
Again he's on the run
Sunbeams shining through his hair
Appearing not to have a care
Well, pick up your gear and Gypsy roll on, roll on

Crossroads, will you ever let him go? No, no, no
Will you hide the dead man's ghost?
Or will he lie, beneath the clay?
Or will his spirit float away?
But I know that he won't stay without Melissa
Yes I know that he won't stay without Melissa



Let me take you baby, down to the river bed
Got to tell you somethin', go right to your head
Cause I got a line on you, babe
I got a line on you
Gotta put your arms around me
With every bit of your love
If you know what to do, I'll make love to you
Cause you got the right line to make it through these times
I got a line on you babe
I got a line on you babe
I got a line on you babe
I got a line on you
I got a line on you babe
You know my winter's almost over
My summer, she's comin' on strong
I can love you, love you, love you
Love you all year long
I got a line on you babe
I got a line on you
I got a line on you babe
I got a line on you
I got a line on you babe



Since you turned the tables on me
I've been steady and learnin' lonely
Keepin' this turntable spinnin'
Everything from Jones to Jennings
Slowly plannin' my survival
In a three-foot stack of vinyl
Since you had to walk on outta here
I've been havin' a record year

I bet you thought before you left
I'd just sit in silence by myself
Turn this house into a jail
Dyin' slow in a livin' hell
But love's got a funny way of keepin' score
And your leavin' lit up my scoreboard
I usually make it through side A sober
All bets are off when I flip her over
One bourbon, one scotch, one beer
I'm havin' a record year

Quarter notes and Hank's half time
Are poundin' on this heart of mine
Song to song, I pass my time
With these speakers on ten
Your good-and-gone keeps me up all night
Along with Songs In The Key of Life
I'm either gonna get over you
Or I'm gonna blow out my ears
Yeah, you're out there now
Doin' God knows how, and I'm stuck here
Havin' a record year
Your leavin' left me goin' crazy
I'm countin' on a needle to save me
I drop it in the groove
And we go 'round and 'round
And down in a spiral
I guess I really oughta call and thank you
I rediscovered  Red Headed Stranger
Got down with old James Brown
And found New Grass Revival
If you find your way back, I owe you a beer
For my record year

Quarter notes and Hank's half time
Are poundin' on this heart of mine
Song to song, I pass my time
With these speakers on ten
Your good-and-gone keeps me up all night
Along with Songs In The Key Of Life
I'm either gonna get over you
Or I'm gonna blow out my ears
Yeah, you're out there now
Doin' God knows how, and I'm stuck here
Havin' a record year
Yeah, I'm havin' a record year



You love her
But she loves him
And he loves somebody else
You just can't win
And so it goes
Till the day you die
This thing they call love
It's gonna make you cry
I've had the blues
The reds and the pinks
One thing for sure

(Love stinks)
Love stinks yeah yeah
(Love stinks)
Love stinks yeah yeah
(Love stinks)
Love stinks yeah yeah
(Love stinks)
Love stinks yeah yeah

Two by two and side by side
Love's gonna find you, yes it is
You just can't hide
You'll hear it call
Your heart will fall
Then love will fly
It's gone, that's all
I don't care what any Casanova thinks
All I can say is
Love stinks
(Love stinks)
Love stinks yeah yeah
(Love stinks)
Love stinks yeah yeah
(Love stinks)
Love stinks yeah yeah
(Love stinks)
Love stinks yeah yeah

Shoo doo wop
Shoo doo wop
Shoo doo wop, shoop, shoop
Shoo doo wop
Shoo doo wop

I've been through diamonds
I've been through minks
I've been through it all
Love stinks

(Love stinks)
Love stinks yeah yeah
(Love stinks)
Love stinks yeah yeah
(Love stinks)
Love stinks yeah yeah
(Love stinks)
Love stinks yeah yeah
Love stinks!

Ooooh, yeah

There goes my old girlfriend
There's another diamond ring
And all those late night promises?
I guess they don't mean a thing
So, baby, what's the story?
Did you find another man?
Is it easy to sleep in the bed that we made?
When you don't look back
I guess the feelings start to fade away
I used to feel your fire
But now it's cold inside
And you're back on the street
Like you didn't miss a beat, yeah

Tell me what it takes to let you go
Tell me how the pain's supposed to go
Tell me how it is that you can sleep in the night
Without thinking you lost everything that was
Good in your life to the toss of the dice
Tell me what it takes to let you go
Yeah
Girl, before I met you
I was F.I.N.E, fine
But your love made me a prisoner
Yeah, my heart's been doing time
You spent me up like money
Then you hung me out to dry
It was easy to keep all your lies in disguise
'Cause you had me in deep with the devil in your eyes

Tell me what it takes to let you go
Tell me how the pain's supposed to go
Tell me how it is that you can sleep in the night
Without thinking you lost everything that was
Good in your life to the toss of the dice
Tell me what it takes to let you go
Aw, guitar!


Tell me that you're happy that you're on your own, yeah, yeah, yeah
Tell me that it's better when you're all alone
Tell me that your body doesn't miss my touch
Tell me that my loving didn't mean that much
Tell me you aren't dying when you're crying for me
Tell me what it takes to let you go (Ooh)
Tell me how the pain's supposed to go (Oh yeah)
Tell me how it is that you can sleep in the night
Without thinking you lost everything that was
Good in your life to the toss of the dice

Tell me who's to blame for thinking twice
No, no, no, no, 'cause I don't want to burn in paradise
Ooo
Let go, let go, let go
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
I don't want to burn, I don't want to burn
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
Yeah

From her head to the ground

I don't know why I love her like I do
All the changes you put me through
Take my money, my cigarettes
I haven't seen the worst of it yet

I wanna know, can you tell me
Am I in love to stay?

Take me to the river, drop me in the water
Take me to the river, dip me in the water
Washing me down, washing me down

I don't know why you treat me so bad
Think of all the things that we could have had
Love is a notion that I can't forget
My sweet sixteen I would never regret

I wanna know, can you tell me?
Am I in love to stay?

Take me to the river, drop me in the water
Push me in the river, dip me in the water
Washing me down, washing me
Hug me, squeeze me, love me, tease me
Till I can't, till I can't, I can't take no more

Dip me in the water, drop me in the river
Push me in the water, drop me in the river
Washing me down, washing me down

I don't know why I love her like I do
All the trouble you put me through
Sixteen candles there on my wall
And here am I, the biggest fool of them all

I wanna know, can you tell me?
Am I in love to stay?

Take me to the river, drop me in the water
Dip me in the river, drop me in the water
Washing me down, washing me down
Ooh, a-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya

Ooh, a na na na
A na na na na, ah!
A na na na, hoo!
A na na na, ooh!
A na na na na, hoo!
Ha! Na na na na, ah!
Na na na na na
Na na na na



We grow old, our hearts are dim
But our minds are free, to fly where they will
Your beauty is faded, you're a broken shell
It's only the weak that fall for your spell

You can't control me no more Cleopatra-patra-patra
You can't control me no more Cleopatra-patra-patra

It's time to move to the next life
You'll be reborn as a beautiful child
You'll turn the heads of a million men
Lady Pharaoh, the Jewel of the Nile

You can't control me no more Cleopatra-patra-patra
You can't control me no more Cleopatra-patra-patra

All the wine we tasted, all the love we made
All the strumming lyres will decorate your grave
All the ecstasy is gone, gone, gone away
Whoa...
Five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five, thirty, thirty-five, forty
You're older, you're colder
Five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five, thirty, thirty-five, forty
You're older, you're colder


You can't control me no more Cleopatra-patra-patra
You can't control me no more Cleopatra-patra-patra
You can't control me no more Cleopatra-patra-patra
You can't control me no more Cleopatra-patra-patra

Five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five, thirty, thirty-five, forty
You're older, you're colder
Five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five, thirty, thirty-five, forty
You're older, you're colder



Ashes to ashes when classes are clashing
My raps, rich like they had the patent for Aspirin
I'm the not the preachy dude, this ain't a chill party
It's full of women but most of them stuck in male bodies
You follow I won't show you where I'm a be
Since I ain't got no crumbs of bread I'll drop a trail of MC's
And it's my honest work, but it's my honor words
So I got all the pull, I make your compass work
They drawn to me, they love the discussion
That I make you fall if I don't double or nothing
Collateral nil, I take my unusual stance
And make number one, make number two in his pants
And draw circle with a slash, don't know how to spell "can't"
Rappers, I'll burp your baby asses, these ain't pat from the back
I'm the addition, do you add? See my limited class
These bitches will move they ass, y'all ain't made out of glass
It's like...

Hey
What ya say?
If you talking 'bout me then move out the way
Hey
I'd like to stay
I'll just shut off my skins and go about my way
(What is it?)
It's your personal thoughts, the victories/follies
And the...why am I here and not in Hawaii's
It's the...cops and the cocky
The clock in her body
From the we're not going to take it so we're not going to lobby
It's the breath and the brain, the hands 
 speech and the thought, the band to the width
It's to lessen the weapons in the hand's of a little nigga
In language that people understand like a middle finger
The power to lust, the song the sacred
From the people that say it when the emperor's naked
Fucking...throw a towel at him
Throw your towel in too
You are foul/fowl and you, just on our menu
Got proof that I kill the tracks, won't show where I hid the knives
That's why I'm still loose in rap, this shit here is vintage Rise
I'll exit an enterprise like it wasn't decked to size
My name on a pencil side, leave one on the desk and slide


So we overshadow like a group of clouds or a chubby man
And understand we perform to a rubber band
And beats stretch out, no popping and spit
Never lands, I'm flaw/floor-less like a bottomless pit
(Who are you?)
I'm rap's energy, lost like "Remember me?"
I sling old slang to refresh your memory
Important something trying to stop me from talking
My heads up and people sticking out they legs when I'm walking
So I, walk like I'm jogging, jog like I run
Run like I drive and drive like I'm flying I come
In like I'm fly, at least that's how it's appearing
Speakers on they mini disc I'm playing just people cheering
Relax, I wait for my ketchup
Chill like I'm very patient
Times I think I'm too kind like a variation
Show you begin steps and tell you what I invest
But don't judge the book by the cover or the index
Ingest the text when it's second to none
I come in third to minus one, I put the F.U. in "fun"



{Intro}

Watching girls go passing by
It ain't the latest thing
I'm just standing in a doorway
I'm just trying to make some sense'
Out of these girls that passing by
The tales they tell of men
I'm not waiting on a lady
I'm just waiting on a friend

A smile relieves a heart that grieves
Remember what I said
I'm not waiting on a lady
I'm just waiting on a friend
Just waiting on a friend
I'm just waiting on a friend
I'm just waiting on a friend
{Bridge}

Don't need a whore, I don't need no booze
Don't need a virgin priest
But I need someone I can cry to
I need someone to protect
Making love and breaking hearts
It is a game for youth
But I'm not waiting on my lady
I'm just waiting on a friend
I'm just waiting on a friend
I'm just waiting on a friend
I'm just waiting on a friend
I'm just waiting on a friend
Just waiting on a friend
Waiting on a friend
Waiting on a friend



You never give me my money
You only give me your sympathy
'Cause I keep on running
There's no way to catch up with me
I'm leaving you, don't make no fuss;
You won't even see me, oh no, for dust
I'm running with the pack
Running with the pack
I'm running with the pack
Never looking back
You try to keep me in cages
But baby, you got to catch me first
You think your law is contagious
I'll do my best, you can do your worst
I'm leaving you, now who can I trust;
You won't even see me, oh no, for dust
I'm running with the pack
Running with the pack
I'm running with the pack
Never looking back
All right
Look out there
I'm running with the pack
Running with the pack
I'm running with the pack
Never looking back
Running with the pack
I'm running with the pack
Running with the pack
Never looking back
Oh, yeah
You can't hold me down
You can't hold me back
On my own way
Running with the pack, ooh
Never, never, never looking back, Oh
Keep on running, keep on running
Yeah, yeah
Moving on, moving out
Oh, oh......



I am Iron Man

Has he lost his mind?
Can he see or is he blind?
Can he walk at all
Or if he moves will he fall?

Is he alive or dead?
Has he thoughts within his head?
We'll just pass him there
Why should we even care?

He was turned to steel
In the great magnetic field
When he traveled time
For the future of mankind

Nobody wants him
He just stares at the world
Planning his vengeance
That he will soon unfurl
Now the time is here
For Iron Man to spread fear
Vengeance from the grave
Kills the people he once saved

Nobody wants him
They just turn their heads
Nobody helps him
Now he has his revenge

Heavy boots of lead
Fills his victims full of dread
Running as fast as they can
Iron Man lives again



In the days of my youth, I was told what it means to be a man
And now I've reached that age, I've tried to do all those things the best I can
No matter how I try, I find my way into the same old jam

Good times, bad times, you know I've had my share
When my woman left home with a brown eyed man
But I still don't seem to care

Sixteen, I fell in love with a girl as sweet as could be
It only took a couple of days 'til she was rid of me
She swore that she would be all mine and love me till the end
But when I whispered in her ear, I lost another friend, oh

Good times, bad times, you know I've had my share
When my woman left home for a brown eyed man
But I still don't seem to care


Good times, bad times, you know I've had my share
When my woman left home for a brown eyed man
But I still don't seem to care
I know what it means to be alone
I sure do wish I was at home
I don't care what the neighbours say
I'm gonna love you each and every day
You can feel the beat within my heart
Realize, sweet babe, we ain't ever gonna part



You tell me there's an angel in your tree
Did he say he'd come to call on me?
For things are getting desperate in our home
Living in the parish of the restless folks I know

Everybody now, bring your family down to the riverside
Look to the east to see where the fat stock hide
Behind four walls of stone the rich man sleeps
It's time we put the flame torch to their keep

Burn down the mission
If we're gonna stay alive
Watch the black smoke fly to heaven
See the red flame light the sky
Burn down the mission
Burn it down to stay alive
It's our only chance of living
Take all you need to live inside

Deep in the woods the squirrels are out today
My wife cried when they came to take me away
But what more could I do just to keep her warm
Than burn, burn, burn, burn, down the mission walls
Now everybody, bring your family down to the riverside
Look to the east to see where the fat stock hide
Behind four walls of stone the rich man sleeps
It's time we put the flame torch to their keep

Burn down the mission, Lord
If we're gonna stay alive
Watch the black smoke fly to heaven
See the red flame light the sky
Burn down the mission, Lord
If we're gonna stay alive
It's our only chance of living
Take all you need to live inside



Time, time and again
I've seen you starin' out at me
Now, then and again, I wonder
What it is that you see
With those Angry Eyes
Well, I bet you wish you could
Cut me down with those Angry Eyes...
You want to believe that
I am not the same as you
I can't conceive, oh no
What it is you're tryin' to do
With those Angry Eyes
Well, I bet you wish you could
Cut me down with those Angry Eyes...
What a shot you could be if
You could shoot at me
With those Angry Eyes...
You tried to defend that
You are not the one to blame
But I'm finding it hard, my friend
When I'm in the deadly aim
Of those Angry Eyes
With those Angry Eyes
Well, I bet you wish you could
Cut me down with those Angry Eyes...
What a shot you could be
If you could shoot at me
With those Angry Eyes...
You have never stopped to realize
Blindness binds us together in the foster skies
Can you see me through those Angry Eyes?



I was alone, I took a ride
I didn't know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I
Could see another kind of mind there
Ooh, then I suddenly see you
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life?

You didn't run, you didn't lie
You knew I wanted just to hold you
And had you gone, you knew in time
We'd meet again, for I had told you
Ooh, you were meant to be near me
Ooh, and I want you to hear me
Say we'll be together every day

Got to get you into my life

What can I do, what can I be?
When I'm with you I want to stay there
If I'm true, I'll never leave
And if I do, I know the way there
Ooh, then I suddenly see you
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life
Got to get you into my life


I've got to get you into my life

I was alone, I took a ride
I didn't know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I
Could see another kind of mind there
And suddenly I see you
Did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life?



I am he as you are he as you are me and we are all together
See how they run like pigs from a gun, see how they fly
I'm crying

Sitting on a cornflake, waiting for the van to come
Corporation tee-shirt, stupid bloody Tuesday
Man, you've been a naughty boy, you let your face grow long

I am the egg man, they are the egg men
I am the walrus, goo goo g'joob

Mister City policeman sitting, pretty little policemen in a row
See how they fly like Lucy in the sky, see how they run
I'm crying, I'm crying
I'm crying, I'm crying

Yellow-matter custard dripping from a dead dog's eye
Crabalocker fishwife, pornographic priestess
Boy, you've been a naughty girl, you let your knickers down

I am the egg man, they are the egg men
I am the walrus, goo goo g'joob
Sitting in an English garden waiting for the sun
If the sun don't come, you get a tan
From standing in the English rain

I am the egg man (Now good sir, what are you?)
They are the egg men (A poor man, made tame to fortune's blows)
I am the walrus, goo goo goo joob (Good pity)
G'goo goo g'joob

Expert, textpert, choking smokers, don't you think the joker laughs at you?
(Ho ho ho, hee hee hee, ha ha ha)
See how they smile like pigs in a sty, see how they snide
I'm crying

Semolina pilchard climbing up the Eiffel Tower
Elementary penguin singing Hare Krishna
Man, you should have seen them kicking Edgar Allan Poe

I am the egg man, they are the egg men
I am the walrus, goo goo g'joob g'goo goo g'joob
Goo goo g'joob g'goo goo g'joob, g'goo
Joob! Joob! Joob!
Joob! Joob! Joob!
Joob! Joob! Joob! Joob! Joob!
Joob! Joob!
Joob! Joob!

Umpa, umpa, stick it up your jumper
Everybody's got one, everybody's got one
“Villain, take my Purse
If ever thou wilt thrive, bury my Body
And give the Letters which thou findst about me
To Edmund Earl of Gloucester: seek him out upon the English Party
Oh, untimely death, death–”
“I know thee well, a serviceable Villain; as duteous to the Vices of thy Mistress as badness would desire”
“What, is he dead?”
“Sit you down, Father; rest you”



You made me cry when you said good-bye
Ain't that a shame...my tears fall like rain
Ain't that a shame...you're the one to blame
You broke my heart, now we're apart
Ain't that a shame...my tears fall like rain
Ain't that a shame...you're the one to blame
Ah, yes you are
Farewell, good-bye, although I'll cry
Ain't that a shame...my tears fall like rain
Ain't that a shame...you're the one to blame
Ah!
You made me cry when you said good-bye
Ain't that a shame...my tears fall like rain
Ain't that a shame...you're the one to blame



Well, I'm hot blooded
Check it and see
I got a fever of a hundred and three
Come on baby, do you do more than dance?
I'm hot blooded, I'm hot blooded

You don't have to read my mind
To know what I have in mind
Honey you oughta know

Now you move so fine
Let me lay it on the line
I wanna know
What you're doin' after the show?

Now it's up to you
We can make a secret rendezvous?
Just me and you
I'll show you loving like you never knew

That's why I'm hot blooded
Check it and see
I got a fever of a hundred and three
Come on baby, do you do more than dance?
I'm hot blooded, hot blooded
If it feels alright
Maybe you can stay all night
Shall I leave you my key?

But you've got to give me a sign
Come on girl, some kind of sign
Tell me, are you hot mama?
You sure look that way to me

Are you old enough?
Will you be ready when I call you bluff?
Is my timing right?
Did you save your love for me tonight?

Yeah, I'm hot blooded
Check it and see
I feel a fever burnin' inside of me
Come on baby, do you do more than dance?
I'm hot blooded, I'm hot blooded
I'm hot!

Now it's up to you
Can we make a secret rendezvous?
Oh, before we do
You'll have to get away from you know who
Well, I'm hot blooded
Check it and see
I got a fever of a hundred and three
Come on baby, do you do more than dance?
I'm hot blooded, I'm hot blooded

Hot blooded, every night
Hot blooded, you're lookin' so tight
Hot blooded, now you're driving me wild
Hot blooded, I'm so hot for you, child
Hot blooded, I'm a little bit high
Hot blooded, you're a little bit shy
Hot blooded, you're makin' me sing
Hot blooded, for you sweet, sweet thing
Did you hear what I said?



Early one morning the sun was shining
I was laying in bed
Wondering if she'd changed at all
If her hair was still red
Her folks they said our lives together
Sure was going to be rough
They never did like Mama's homemade dress
Papa's bankbook wasn't big enough
And I was standing on the side of the road
Rain falling on my shoes
Heading out for the East Coast
Lord knows I've paid some dues
Getting through
Tangled up in blue

She was married when we first met
Soon to be divorced
I helped her out of a jam, I guess
But I used a little too much force
We drove that car as far as we could
Abandoned it out West
Split up on a dark sad night
Both agreeing it was best
She turned around to look at me
As I was walking away
I heard her say over my shoulder
"We'll meet again someday
On the avenue"
Tangled up in blue
I had a job in the great north woods
Working as a cook for a spell
But I never did like it all that much
And one day the ax just fell
So I drifted down to New Orleans
Where I lucky was to be employed
Working for a while on a fishing boat
Right outside of Delacroix
But all the while I was alone
The past was close behind
I seen a lot of women
But she never escaped my mind
And I just grew
Tangled up in blue

She was working in a topless place
And I stopped in for a beer
I just kept looking at the side of her face
In the spotlight, so clear
And later on, when the crowd thinned out
I was just about to do the same
She was standing there, in back of my chair
Said to me "Tell me, don't I know your name?"
I muttered something underneath my breath
She studied the lines on my face
I must admit, I felt a little uneasy
When she bent down to tie the laces
Of my shoe
Tangled up in blue
She lit a burner on the stove
And offered me a pipe
"I thought you'd never say hello" she said
"You look like the silent type"
Then she opened up a book of poems
And handed it to me
Written by an Italian poet
From the thirteenth century
And every one of them words rang true
And glowed like burning coal
Pouring off of every page
Like it was written in my soul
From me to you
Tangled up in blue

I lived with them on Montague Street
In a basement down the stairs
There was music in the cafes at night
And revolution in the air
Then he started into dealing with slaves
And something inside of him died
She had to sell everything she owned
And froze up inside
And when it finally, the bottom fell out
I became withdrawn
The only thing I knew how to do
Was to keep on keeping on
Like a bird that flew
Tangled up in blue
So now I'm going back again
I got to get to her somehow
All the people we used to know
They're an illusion to me now
Some are mathematicians
Some are carpenter's wives
Don't know how it all got started
I don't know what they're doing with their lives
But me, I'm still on the road
A-heading for another joint
We always did feel the same
We just saw it from a different point
Of view
Tangled up in blue



Oh Mama, I'm in fear for my life from the long arm of the law
Lawman has put an end to my running, and I'm so far from my home
Oh Mama, I can hear you a-cryin', you're so scared and all alone
Hangman is comin' down from the gallows, and I don't have very long
(Yeah!)

The jig is up, the news is out
They finally found me
The renegade who had it made
Retrieved for a bounty
Nevermore to go astray
This'll be the end today
Of the wanted man

Oh Mama, I've been years on the lam and had a high price on my head
Lawman said, "Get him dead or alive;" I was for sure he'll see me dead
Dear Mama, I can hear you a-cryin', you're so scared and all alone
Hangman is comin' down from the gallows, and I don't have very long

The jig is up, the news is out
They finally found me
The renegade who had it made
Retrieved for a bounty
Nevermore to go astray
The judge will have revenge today
On the wanted man

Oh Mama, I'm in fear for my life from the long arm of the law
Hangman is comin' down from the gallows, and I don't have very long

The jig is up, the news is out
They finally found me
The renegade who had it made
Retrieved for a bounty
Nevermore to go astray
This'll be the end today
Of the wanted man
The wanted man

And I don't wanna go, no, no
Mama, don't let 'em take me!
Hey, hey
No, no, no, I can't go



Woo!
Get it

In the mornin' don't say you love me
'Cause I'll only kick you out of the door
I know your name is Rita 'cause your perfume's smelling sweeter
Since when I saw you down on the floor, guitar

You won't need too much pursuadin'
I don't mean to sound degradin'
But with a face like that
You got nothin' to laugh about
Red lips, hair and fingernails
I hear you're a mean old Jezebel
Let's go upstairs
And read my tarot cards, come on

Stay with me, stay with me
For tonight you'd better stay with me, oh yeah
Stay with me, stay with me
For tonight you'd better stay with me
So, in the mornin', please don't say you love me
'Cause you know I'll only kick you out the door
Yeah, I'll pay your cab fare home, you can even use my best cologne
Just don't be here in the mornin' when I wake up, come on, honey

Stay with me, stay with me
'Cause tonight you're gonna stay with me
Sit down, get up, get out
Stay with me, stay with me
'Cause tonight you're gonna stay with me
Hey, what's your name again?

Get out



Last Sunday morning, the sunshine felt like rain
Week before, they all seemed the same
With the help of God and true friends, I come to realize
I still had two strong legs and even wings to fly

And oh I ain't wastin' time no more
'Cause time goes by like hurricanes and faster things

Lord, Lord Miss Sally why are you crying?
Been around here three long days, looking like you're dying
Just step yourself outside and look up at the stars above
Go on downtown baby, find somebody to love

Meanwhile I ain't wastin' time no more
'Cause time goes by like pouring rain and much faster things

You don't need no gypsy to tell you why
You can't let one precious day slip by
Look inside yourself and if you don't see what you want
Maybe sometimes then you don't
But leave your mind alone and just get high

Well by and by, way after many years have gone
And all the war freaks die off, leaving us alone
We'll raise our children in the peaceful way we can
It's up to you and me brother to try and try again

Well hear us now, we ain't wastin' time no more
'Cause time goes by like hurricanes
Runnin' after subway trains
Don't forget the pouring rain



I wanna live with a cinnamon girl
I could be happy the rest of my life
With a cinnamon girl
A dreamer of pictures, I run in the night
You see us together, chasing the moonlight
My cinnamon girl
Ten silver saxes, a bass with a bow
The drummer relaxes and waits between shows
For his cinnamon girl
A dreamer of pictures, I run in the night
You see us together, chasing the moonlight
My cinnamon girl
Pa, send me money now
I'm going to make it somehow
I need another chance
You see your baby loves to dance
Yeah, yeah, yeah



How many times must I tell you babe
How many bridges I have got to cross?
How many times must I explain myself
Before I can talk to the boss?
Before I can talk to the boss?

How many times must I say I love you
Before you finally understand?
Won't you be my forever woman?
I will try to be your forever man
Try to be your forever man

How many times must I say I love you
Before you finally understand?
Won't you be my forever woman?
I will try to be your forever man
Try to be your forever man

Forever man, forever man, forever man
Forever man, forever man, forever man
Try to be your forever man
Forever man, forever man, forever man
Forever man, forever man, forever man
Try to be your forever man



In a place you always dream of, where your soul is always free
Silver stages, golden curtains, filled my head plain as could be
As a rainbow grew around the sun, all my stars above, who died
Came somewhere beyond the scene you see
These lovely people played for me

Now if I let you see this place where stories all ring true
Will you let me past your face to see what's really you?
It's not for me I ask this question as though I were a king
For you have to love, believe and feel
Before the burst of tambourines take you there

Green grass and high tides forever
Castles of stone, soul and glory
Lost faces say we adore you
As kings and queens bow and play for you

Those who don't believe me, find your souls and set them free
Those who do, believe and know that time will be your key
Time and time again I've thanked them for a peace of mind
That helped me find myself amongst the music and the rhyme
That enchants you there
Green grass and high tides forever
Castles of stone, soul and glory
Lost faces say we adore you
As kings and queens bow and play for you

Yeah, play for you



Remember when the days were long
And rolled beneath a deep blue sky
Didn't have a care in the world
With mommy and daddy standin' by
But "happily ever after" fails
And we've been poisoned by these fairy tales
The lawyers dwell on small details
Since daddy had to fly
Oh, but I know a place where we can go
Still untouched by men
Sit and watch the clouds roll by
And the tall grass waves in the wind
You can lay your head back on the ground
And let your hair fall all around me
Offer up your best defense
But this is the end
This is the end of the innocence
O' beautiful, for spacious skies
But now those skies are threatening
They're beating plowshares into swords
For this tired old man that we elected king
Armchair warriors often fail
And we've been poisoned by these fairy tales
The lawyers clean up all details
Since daddy had to lie
Oh, but I know a place where we can go
And wash away this sin
We'll sit and watch the clouds roll by
And the tall grass waves in the wind
Just lay your head back on the ground
And let your hair spill all around me
Offer up your best defense
But this is the end
This is the end of the innocence

Who knows how long this will last
Now we've come so far, so fast
But, somewhere back there in the dust
That same small town in each of us
I need to remember this
So baby give me just one kiss
And let me take a long last look
Before we say goodbye
Just lay your head back on the ground
And let your hair fall all around me
Offer up your best defense
But this is the end
This is the end of the innocence
Oh nah nah
Naaah



I lit out from Reno, I was trailed by twenty hounds
Didn't get to sleep that night 'til the morning came around

Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
Just might get some sleep tonight

Ran into the devil, babe, he loaned me twenty bills
Spent the night in Utah in a cave up in the hills

Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
Just might get some sleep tonight

I ran down to the levee but the devil caught me there
He took my twenty dollar bill and he vanished in the air

Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
Just might get some sleep tonight
Got two reasons why I cry away each lonely night:
The first one's named sweet Anne Marie, and she's my heart's delight
The second one is prison, babe, and the sheriff's on my trail
And if he catches up with me, I'll spend my life in jail

Got a wife in Chino, babe, and one in Cherokee
The first one says she's got my child, but it don't look like me

Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
Just might get some sleep tonight

Got two reasons why I cry away each lonely night:
The first one's named sweet Anne Marie, and she's my heart's delight

Born down in a dead man's town
The first kick I took was when I hit the ground
You end up like a dog that's been beat too much
'Til you spend half your life just coverin' up
Born in the U.S.A
I was born in the U.S.A
I was born in the U.S.A
Born in the U.S.A
Got in a little hometown jam
So they put a rifle in my hand
Sent me off to a foreign land
To go and kill the yellow man
Born in the U.S.A
I was born in the U.S.A
I was born in the U.S.A
I was born in the U.S.A
Come back home to the refinery
Hiring man says, "Son if it was up to me"
Went down to see my V.A. man
He said, "Son, don't you understand"
I had a brother at Khe Sanh
Fighting off the Viet Cong
They're still there, he's all gone
He had a woman he loved in Saigon
I got a picture of him in her arms now
Down in the shadow of the penitentiary
Out by the gas fires of the refinery
I'm ten years burning down the road
Nowhere to run ain't got nowhere to go
Born in the U.S.A
I was born in the U.S.A. now
Born in the U.S.A
I'm a long gone Daddy in the U.S.A. now
Born in the U.S.A
Born in the U.S.A
Born in the U.S.A
I'm a cool rockin' Daddy in the U.S.A. now



It used to seem to me
That my life ran on too fast
And I had to take it slowly
Just to make the good parts last
But when you're born to run
It's so hard to just slow down
So don't be surprised to see me
Back in that bright part of town
I'll be back in the high life again
All the doors I closed one time
Will open up again
I'll be back in the high life again
All the eyes that watched me once
Will smile and take me in
And I'll drink and dance with one hand free
Let the world back into me
And oh I'll be a sight to see
Back in the high life again
Girl you used to be the best
To make life be life to me
And I hope that you're still out there
And you're like you used to be
We'll have ourselves a time
And we'll dance till the morning sun
And we'll let the good times come in
And we won't stop till we're done
We'll be back in the high life again
All the doors I closed one time
Will open up again
We'll be back in the high life again
All the eyes that watched us once
Will smile and take us in
And we'll drink and dance with one hand free
And have the world so easily
And oh we'll be a sight to see
Back in the high life again
High life
High life
In the high life again
We'll be back in the high life again
All the doors I closed one time
Will open up again
We'll be back in the high life again
All the eyes that watched us once
Will smile and take us in
And we'll drink and dance with one hand free
And have the world so easily
And oh we'll be a sight to see
Back in the high life again
High life
Back in the high life
Oh, we'll be back



Out of the street, you better get on home
Tail shaking filly running on her own
They say she got loose on the night she was born
Cranking it up in a school zone
Kick it out
Come on, kick it out
She said kick out your motor and drive while you're still alive
Kick it out
Sitting in a bar in a seaside town
Sweet little love getting high, getting down
Well, sailors see her running along the beach
Laugh and jump out of reach
Wild music blowing in her mane
She needs a bareback rider, won't give her no pain
A hard racy game of give and take
She never plays half-crazed in her wake
Kick it out
She said kick it out.  Come on, come on
Kick out your motor and drive while you're still alive
Kick it out
Oooh, yeah.  Kick it out
Come on, kick out your motor and drive while you're still alive
Kick it out.  Woo!
(Guitar solo)
Ooooooh, she said kick it out
Ah, kick out your motor and drive while you're still alive
Kick it out
Oooh, yeah.  Oh, oh, oh
Kick out your motor and drive while you're still alive
Kick it out
Oooh.  Oooh, oooh, yeah

And take a long ride
On my motorbike until I'm ready
Crazy little thing called love

I know it's late
I know you're weary
I know your plans don't include me
Still, here we are
Both of us lonely
Longing for shelter from all that we see
Why should we worry
No one will care, girl
Look at the stars so far away

We've got tonight
Who needs tomorrow
We've got tonight babe why don't you stay

Deep in my soul
I've been so lonely
All of my hopes fading away
I've longed for love
Like everyone else does
I know I'll keep searchin' even after today

So there it is, girl
I've said it all now
And here we are, babe
What do you say
We've got tonight
Who needs tomorrow
We've got tonight babe why don't you stay

I know it's late I know you're weary
Ohhhh I know your plans don't include me
Still, here we are
Both of us lonely, both of us lonely

We've got tonight
Who needs tomorrow
Let's make it last
Let's find a way
Turn out the light come take my hand now
We've got tonight why don't you stay
We've got tonight
Who needs tomorrow

Ohhh ohhhhh why don't you stay



If you twist and turn away
If you tear yourself in two again
If I could, yes I would
If I could, I would let it go
Surrender, dislocate
If I could throw this lifeless lifeline to the wind
Leave this heart of clay, see you walk, walk away
Into the night, and through the rain
Into the half light and through the flame
If I could, through myself, set your spirit free
I'd lead your heart away, see you break, break away
Into the light and to the day
Hoo, hoo!
Hoo, hoo!
Hoo, hoo!
Hoo, hoo!
Hoo, hoo!
Hoo, hoo!
To let it go and so to fade away
To let it go and so fade away
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake, wide awake
I'm not sleeping
Oh no, no, no
If you should ask, then maybe
They'd tell you what I would say
True colours fly in blue and black
Blue silken sky and burning flag
Colours crash, collide in blood-shot eyes
Hoo, hoo!
Hoo, hoo!
Hoo, hoo!
If I could, you know I would
If I could, I would let it go
This desperation, dislocation
Separation, condemnation
Revelation, in temptation
Isolation, desolation
Let it go and so fade away
To let it go, oh yeah, and so fade away
To let it go, oh no, and so to fade away
I'm wide awake, I'm wide awake
Wide awake, I'm not sleeping
Oh no, no, no



Dreamer, you know you are a dreamer
Well, can you put your hands in your head? Oh no!
I said, dreamer, you're nothing but a dreamer
Well, can you put your hands in your head? Oh no!

You know, well, you know you had it comin' to you
Now there's not a lot I can do

Dreamer, you stupid little dreamer
So, now you put your head in your hands, oh no!
Woo!

I said "Far out, - What a day, a year, a life it is!"
You know, well, you know you had it comin' to you

You can see anything you want, boy
If I could be someone
You can be anyone, celebrate, boy
Well, if I could do something
You can do something
If I could do anything
Can you do something out of this world?
Take a dream on a Sunday
Take a life, take a holiday
Take a lie, take a dreamer

Born a poor young country boy
Mother Nature's son
All day long, I'm sitting singing songs for everyone

Sit beside a mountain stream
See her waters rise
Listen to the pretty sound of music as she flies

Find me in my field of grass
Mother Nature's son
Swaying daisies sing a lazy song beneath the sun

Mother Nature's son



Worry the bottle, Mama, it's grapefruit wine
Kick off your high-heel sneakers, it's party time
The girls don't seem to care what's on
As long as they play till dawn
Nothin' but blues and Elvis
And somebody else's favorite song
Give her some funked-up Muzak, she treats you nice
Feed her some hungry reggae, she'll love you twice
The girls don't seem to care tonight
As long as the mood is right
No static at all
No static, no static at all
FM, no static at all
Give her some funked-up Muzak, she treats you nice
Feed her some hungry reggae, she'll love you twice
The girls don't seem to care tonight
As long as the mood is right
No static at all
No static, no static at all
FM, no static at all

I drink alone
Yeah, with nobody else
I drink alone
Yeah, with nobody else
Yeah, you know when I drink alone
I prefer to be by myself

I don't want no coffee or tea
Just me and my good buddy Wiser
That's all I ever need

‘Cause I drink alone
Yeah, with nobody else
Yeah, you know when I drink alone

Yeah, with nobody else
Yeah, you know when I drink alone
I prefer to be by myself
Yeah, you know when I drink alone
I prefer to be by myself

I'd like to do a song
Of great social and political import
It goes like this

Oh Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz
My friends all drive Porsches, I must make amends
Worked hard all my lifetime, no help from my friends
So Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz

Oh Lord, won't you buy me a color TV
Dialing For Dollars is trying to find me
I wait for delivery each day until three
So oh Lord, won't you buy me a color TV

Oh Lord, won't you buy me a night on the town
I'm counting on you, Lord, please don't let me down
Prove that you love me and buy the next round
Oh Lord, won't you buy me a night on the town

Oh Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz
My friends all drive Porsches, I must make amends
Worked hard all my lifetime, no help from my friends
So Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz
Spoken:
That's it!  (cackle)



He had a thousand ideas
You might have heard his name
He lived alone with his vision;
Not looking for fortune or fame
Never said too much to speak of;
He was off on another plain
The words that he said were a mystery
Nobody's sure he was sane

But he knew, he knew more than me or you
No one could see his view
Oh, where was he going to?
He was in search of an answer
The nature of what we are
He was trying to do it a new way
He was bright as a star
But nobody understood him
"His numbers are not the way"
He's lost in the deepest enigma
Which no one's unraveled today

But he knew, he knew more than me or you
No one could see his view
Oh, where was he going to?
And he tried
But before he could tell us he died
When he left us the people cried
Where was he going to? Oh
He had a different idea
A glimpse of the master plan
He could see into the future
A true visionary man
But there's something he never told us
It died when he went away
If only he could have been with us
No telling what he might say

But he knew, he knew more than me or you
No one could see his view
Where was he going to?
But he knew, you can tell by the picture he drew
It was totally something new
Oh, where was he going to?



Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there ain't no place I'm goin' to
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle morning, I'll come followin' you
Take me for a trip upon your magic swirlin' ship
All my senses have been stripped
And my hands can't feel to grip
And my toes too numb to step
Wait only for my boot heels to be wanderin'
I'm ready to go anywhere, I'm ready for to fade
Unto my own parade
Cast your dancing spell my way
I promise to go under it
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there ain't no place I'm goin' to
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you



All alone at the end of the evening
When the bright lights have faded to blue
I was thinking 'bout a woman who might have
Loved me and I never knew
You know I've always been a dreamer
(Spent my life running 'round)
And it's so hard to change
(Can't seem to settle down)
But the dreams I've seen lately
Keep on turning out and burning out
And turning out the same

So put me on a highway
And show me a sign
And take it to the limit one more time

You can spend all your time making money
You can spend all your love making time
If it all fell to pieces tomorrow
Would you still be mine?
And when you're looking for your freedom
(Nobody seems to care)
And you can't find the door
(Can't find it anywhere)
When there's nothing to believe in
Still you're coming back, you're running back
You're coming back for more
So put me on a highway
And show me a sign
And take it to the limit one more time

Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit
Come on and take it to the limit one more time
Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit
You gotta take it to the limit one more time
Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit
Come on and take it to the limit one more time
Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit
Come on and take it to the limit
You got to take it to the limit one more time



Take me across the water cause I need some place to hide
I done the rancher's daughter and I sure did hurt his pride
Haha
Well, there's a hundred miles of desert lies between his hide and mine
I don't need no food and no water, Lord, cause I'm runnin' out of time
Fightin', killin', wine and women gonna put me to my grave
Runnin', hidin', losin', cryin', nothing left to save
But my life
Stood on a ridge and shunned religion, thinking the world was mine
I made my break and a big mistake, stealin' when I should have been buyin'
All that fightin', killin', wine and those women gonna put me to an early grave
Runnin', hidin', losin', cryin', nothing left to save
But my life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life
So I stood on a ridge and shunned religion, thinking the world was mine
I made my break and a big mistake, stealin' when I should have been buyin'
I was stealin' when I should have been buyin'
I was stealin' when I should have been buyin'
Stealin' when I should have been buyin'
Stealin' when I should have been buyin'
Stealin' when I should have been buyin'
Stealin' when I should have been buyin'
Stealin' woo
Stealin' hahaha, yeh
I was stealin' when I should have been buyin'
Stealin', oh yeh yeh yeh yeh yeh
Stealin', oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo
Stealin', rock'n'roll, all right
Stealin', rock'n'roll, all right
Stealin' babe, babe
Stealin', should, should, should have been buyin'
Stealin', should, should, should have been buyin'
Stealin', should have, should have, should have been buyin'
Stealin', buying, yeah

Athena, I had no idea how much I would need her
In peaceful times I hold her close and I feed her
My heart starts palpitating when I think my guess was wrong
But I think I will get along
She's just a girl – she's a bomb
Athena, all I ever want to do is please her
My life has been so settled and she is the reason
Just one word from her and my troubles are long gone
But I think I'll  get along
She's just a girl – she's a bomb

Just a girl, just a girl
She's just a girl

Athena, my heart felt like a shattered glass in an acid bath
I felt like one of those flattened ants you find on a crazy path
I would of topped myself to give her time she did not need to ask
Was I a suicidal psychopath?
She's just a girl – she's a bomb
Consumed, there was a beautiful white horse I saw on a dream stage
He had a snake the size of a sewer pipe living in his rib cage
I felt like a pickled priest who was being flambed
You got me requisitioned Blondie
She's just a girl – she's a bomb
I'm happy, I'm ecstatic
Just a girl, just a girl
She's just a girl

Look into the face of a child
Measure how long you smiled
Before the memory claimed
How long would children remain
How long could children remain
Athena, you picked me up by my lapels and screamed "leave her"
It felt like waking up in heaven on an empty meter
And now you are stuck with a castrated leader
And I hate the creep, I didn't mean that

She's a bomb
I just said it
She is a bomb
I didn't mean it, please
She's a bomb

Athena, I had no idea how much I need her
My life has been so settled and she is the reason
Just one word from her and my troubles are long gone
But I get along
She's just a girl, she's a bomb



As I was walking down the street one day
A man came up to me and asked me
What the time was that was on my watch
Yeah... and I said

(I don't) Does anybody really know what time it is?
(Care) Does anybody really care?
(About time) If so, I can't imagine why
(Oh no, no) We've all got time enough to cry

And I was walking down the street one day
A pretty lady looked at me
And said her diamond watch had stopped cold dead
And I said

(I don't) Does anybody really know what time it is?
(Care) Does anybody really care?
(About time) If so, I can't imagine why
(Oh no, no) We've all got time enough to cry
And I was walking down the street one day
Being pushed and shoved by people
Trying to beat the clock, oh, no
I just don't know, I don't know, I don't know-oh
And I said... yes, I said
(Background:)
People runnin' everywhere
Don't know where to go
Don't know where I am
Can't see past the next step
Don't have time to think past the last one
Have no time to look around
Just run around, run around think why

(I don't) Does anybody really know what time it is?
(Care) Does anybody really care?
(About time) If so I can't imagine why
(Oh no, no) We've all got time enough to die

Everybody's working
(I don't care) I don't care
(About time) About time
(Oh no, no) I don't care



Well, I was rolling down the road
In some cold blue steel
I had a blues man on the back
And a beautician at the wheel
We going downtown
In the middle of the night
We laughing and I'm joking
And we feeling alright

Oh I'm bad, I'm nationwide
Yes I'm bad, I'm nationwide
Easing down the highway
In a new Cadillac

They sporting short dresses
Wearing spike-heel shoes
They smoking Lucky Strikes
And wearing nylons too

Cause we bad, we're nationwide
Yeah we bad, we're nationwide

Well, I was moving down the road
In my V-8 Ford
I had a shine on my boots
I had my sideburns lowered
With my New York brim
And my gold tooth displayed
Nobody give me trouble
Cause they know I got it made
I'm bad, I'm nationwide
Well, I'm bad, bad, bad
Bad, bad, I'm nationwide, yeah, yeah

Let's go down to the Sunset Grill
We can watch the working girls go by
Watch the basket people walk around and mumble
Stare out at the auburn sky

There's an old man there from the old world
To him, it's all the same
Calls all his customers by name

Down at the Sunset Grill
Down at the Sunset Grill
Down at the Sunset Grill
Down at the Sunset Grill

You see a lot more meanness in the city
It's the kind that eats you up inside
Hard to come away with anything that feels like dignity
Hard to get home with any pride

These days a man makes you somethin'
And you never see his face
But there is no hiding place
Down at the Sunset Grill
Down at the Sunset Grill
Down at the Sunset Grill
Down at the Sunset Grill

Respectable little murders pay
They get more respectable every day
Don't worry, girl
I'm gonna stick by you
And someday soon
We're gonna get in that car
And get outta here


Let's go down to the Sunset Grill
Watch the working girls go by
Watch the basket people walk around and mumble
Gaze out at the auburn sky

Maybe we'll leave come springtime
Meanwhile, have another beer
What would we do without all these jerks anyway?
Besides, all our friends are here
Down at the Sunset Grill
Down at the Sunset Grill
Down at the Sunset Grill
Down at the Sunset Grill



Angel came down from heaven yesterday
She stayed with me
Just long enough to rescue me
And she told me a story yesterday
About the sweet love between
The moon and the deep blue sea
And then she spread her wings high over me
She said she is going to come back tomorrow

And I said, "Fly on, my sweet angel
Fly on through the sky
Fly on my sweet angel
Tomorrow I'm going to be by your side"
Sure enough this morning came unto me
Silver wings silhouetted against the child's sunrise
And my angel she said unto me
"Today is the day for you to rise
Take my hand, you are going to be my man
You are going to rise"
And then she took me high over yonder

And I said, "Fly on, my sweet angel
Fly on through the sky
Fly on my sweet angel
Forever I will be by your side"



Time is on my side, yes it is

You're searching for good times

But just wait and see
You'll come running back (I won't have to worry no more)
You'll come running back (spend the rest of my life with you, baby)
You'll come running back to me
Go ahead, go ahead and light up the town

And baby, do everything your heart desires
Remember, I'll always be around
And I know, I know
Like I told you so many times before
You're going to come back, baby
Because I know
You're going to come back knocking
Yeah, knocking right on my door
Yes, yes!
Well, time is on my side, yes it is
Time is on my side, yes it is
Cause I got the real love
The kind that you need
You'll come running back (said you would, baby)
You'll come running back (I don't always said you would)
You'll come running back (I won't have to worry no more)

Yes time, time, time is on my side, yes it is
Time, time, time is on my side, yes it is
Oh, time, time, time is on my side, yes it is
I said, time, time, time is on my side, yes it is
Oh, time, time, time is on my side

You know I've smoked a lot of grass
O' Lord, I've popped a lot of pills
But I never touched nothin'
That my spirit could kill

You know, I've seen a lot of people walkin' 'round
With tombstones in their eyes
But the pusher don't care
Ah, if you live or if you die

God damn, the pusher
God damn, I say the pusher
I said God damn
God damn the pusher man

You know the dealer, the dealer is a man
With the love grass in his hand
Oh but the pusher is a monster
Good God, he's not a natural man

The dealer for a nickel

Ah, but the pusher ruin your body
Lord, he'll leave your
He'll leave your mind to scream
God damn, the pusher
God damn, God damn the pusher
I said God damn
God, God damn the pusher man


Well, now if I were the president of this land
You know, I'd declare total war on the pusher man
I'd cut him if he stands, and I'd shoot him if he'd run
Yes, I'd kill him with my Bible and my razor and my gun

God damn, oh, the pusher
God damn the pusher
I said God damn
God damn the pusher man...



Hey, girl, stop what you're doing!
Hey, girl, you'll drive me to ruin

Won't you let me hold you, let me feel your loving touch

Communication breakdown

I'm having a nervous breakdown
Drive me insane

Hey, babe, I got something I think you ought to know
Hey, babe, I wanna tell you that I love you so
I wanna hold you in my arms, yeah!
I'm never gonna let you go, 'cause I like your charms

Communication breakdown

We were born before the wind
Also younger than the sun
Ere the bonnie boat was won
As we sailed into the mystic

Hark, now hear the sailors cry
Smell the sea and feel the sky
Let your soul and spirit fly
Into the mystic

And when that foghorn blows
I will be coming home, mmhmm hmm
And when the foghorn blows
I want to hear it
I don't have to fear it

And I want to rock your gypsy soul
Just like way back in the days of old
And magnificently we will float
Into the mystic, mmm

When that foghorn blows
You know I will be coming home, mmm uh
And when that foghorn whistle blows
I gotta hear it
I don't have to fear it

And I wanna rock your gypsy soul
Just like way back in the days of old
And together we will float
Into the mystic, mmm
Come on girl


Too late to stop now



There I was at the immigration scene
Shining and feeling clean
Could it be a sin?
I got stopped by the immigration man
He says he doesn't know if he can
Let me in - let me in - immigration man
Can I cross the line and pray
I can stay another day
Let me in immigration man
I won't toe your line today
I can't see it anyway
There he was with his immigration face
Giving me a paper chase
But the sun was coming
Cos all at once he looked into my space
And stamped a number over my face
And it sent me running
Let me in - let me in - immigration man
Can I cross the line and pray
I can stay another day
Let me in immigration man
I won't toe your line today
I can't see it anyway
Here I am with my immigration form
It's big enough to keep me warm
When a cold wind's coming
So go where you will
As long as you think you can
You'd better watch out - watch out for the man
Anywhere you're going
Won't you let me in immigration man
Can I cross the line and pray
Take your fingers from the tray
Let me in - irritation man
I won't toe your line today
I can't see it anyway



Conquistador your stallion stands
In need of company
And like some angel's haloed brow
You reek of purity
I see your armour-plated breast
Has long since lost its sheen
And in your death mask face
There are no signs which can be seen

Though I hoped for something to find
I could see no maze to unwind

Conquistador a vulture sits
Upon your silver shield
And in your rusty scabbard now
The sand has taken seed
And though your jewel-encrusted blade
Has not been plundered still
The sea has washed across your face
And taken of its fill
Though I hoped for something to find
I could see no maze to unwind
Though I hoped for something to find
I could see no maze to unwind

Conquistador there is no time
I must pay my respect
And though I came to jeer at you
I leave now with regret
And as the gloom begins to fall
I see there is no aureole
And though you came with sword held high
You did not conquer, only die

Though I hoped for something to find
I could see no maze to unwind
Though I hoped for something to find
I could see no maze to unwind

And though I hoped for something to find
I could see no maze to unwind



I went back to the doctor
To get another shrink
I sit and tell him about my weekend
But he never betrays what he thinks
Can you see the real me, doctor, doctor?
Can you see the real me, doctor?
Oh, doctor

I went back to my mother
I said, "I'm crazy Ma help me"
She said, "I know how it feels, son
'Cause it runs in the family"
Can you see the real me, mother, mother?
Can you see the real me, mother?
Oh, mama
Can you see
Can you see
Can you see the real me?
Can you see
Can you see the real me?
The real me, the real me
The cracks between the paving stones
Like rivers of flowing veins
Strange people who know me
Peeping from behind every window pane
The girl I used to love
Lives in this yellow house
Yesterday she passed me by
She doesn't want to know me now
Can you see the real me, can you, can you?
Can you see the real me, can you?
Oh yes

I ended up with the preacher
Full of lies and hate
I seemed to scare him a little
So he showed me to the golden gate
Can you see the real me, preacher, preacher?
Can you see the real me, preacher?

Can you see, can you see, can you see
Can you see the real me doctor
Can you see the real me mother
Can you see the real me me me me me...

Gonna do you in
'Cause she's the witch

I feel free
(ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh...)
(x9)
Feel when I dance with you
We move like the sea
You, you're all I want to know
I feel free
I feel free
I feel free
I can walk down the street, there's no one there
Though the pavements are one huge crowd
I can drive down the road; my eyes don't see
Though my mind wants to cry out loud
I, I, I, I feel free
I feel free
I feel free
I can walk down the street, there's no one there
Though the pavements are one huge crowd
I can drive down the road; my eyes don't see
Though my mind wants to cry out loud
Though my mind wants to cry out loud
Dance floor is like the sea
Ceiling is the sky
You're the sun and as you shine on me
I feel free
I feel free
I feel free
I... I...



It ain't easy
Living like a gypsy
Tell your honey how I feel
I've been dreaming
Floating down the stream and
Losing touch with all that's real
Whole earth lover
Keeping under cover
Never know where you've been
You've been fading
Always out parading
Keep in touch with Mama Kin
Well you've always got your tail on the wag
Shooting fire from your mouth
Just like a dragon
You act like a perpetual drag
You better check it out
Because someday soon, you'll have to
Climb back on the wagon

It isn't easy living like you wanna
It's so hard to find peace of mind, yes, it is
The way I see it, you've got to say shit
But don't forget to drop me a line
Said, you're bald as an egg when you're eighteen
And working for your dad is just a drag
You still stuff your mouth with your dreams
You better check it out
Or someday soon you'll have to
Climb back on the wagon

Keep in touch with Mama Kin
Tell her where you've gone and been
Living out your fantasy
Sleeping late and smoking tea
Keep in touch with Mama Kin
Tell her where you've gone and been
Living out your fantasy
Sleeping late and smoking tea

Tell her where you've gone and been
Living out your fantasy
Sleeping late and smoking tea

You can swim the sea
You can jump into the fire
But you'll never be free
You can shake me up
Or I can break you down
Whoa-o-o-o-, whoa-o-o-o-
We can make each other happy

{Intro}
I'm so hot for her, I'm so hot for her
I'm so hot for her and she's so cold
I'm so hot for her, I'm on fire for her
I'm so hot for her and she's so cold
I'm the burning bush, I'm the burning fire
I'm the bleeding volcano
I'm so hot for her, I'm so hot for her
I'm so hot for her and she's so cold
{Hook}
Yeah, I tried re-wiring her
Tried re-firing her
I think her engine is permanently stalled
She's so cold she's so cold
She's so cold cold cold
Like a tombstone
She's so cold, she's so cold
She's so cold cold, cold like an ice cream cone
She's so cold she's so cold
I dare not touch her my hand just froze
{Hook}
Yeah, I'm so hot for hot for her, I'm so hot for her
I'm so hot for her and even so
Put your hand on the heat, put your hand on the heat
Aw Come on baby, let's go
She's so cold, she's so cold, cold, she's so c-c-c-old
But she's beautiful, though
Yeah, she's so cold
{Bridge}
She's so cold, she's so cold
She was born in an arctic zone
She's so cold she's so cold, cold, cold
I dare not touch her my hand just froze
She's so cold, she's so goddamn cold she's so
Cold cold cold she's so cold
{Hook}
Who would believe you were a beauty indeed
When the days get shorter and the nights get long
Lie awake when the rain comes
Nobody will know, when you're old
When you're old, nobody will know
That you was a beauty, a sweet sweet beauty
A sweet sweet beauty, but stone stone cold
You're so cold, you're so cold, cold, cold
You're so cold, you're so cold
I'm so hot for you, i'm so hot for you
I'm so hot for you and you're so cold
I'm the burning bush, I'm the burning fire
I'm the bleeding volcano

The message you're about to hear is not meant for transmission
Should only be accessed in the privacy of your mind
Words are intense so my dear if you dare to listen
Take off your clothes
And Meet me between the lines

Are you ready for the touch that makes you go insane
Breast to lips to cheek to mane
I'll pull your hair, you'll feel no pain
Are you ready for the only forever we'll both obtain
The only joy in this forsaken game
You'll feel ashamed and ordained
When I lay my hands on you

The touch you're about to feel is the one you've been wishin' for
It's been here like an echo inside your space and time
It's about to get freaky cause the places that I'll be kissin'
Are the places that no other man could ever find
Oh wind up ready for

The touch that makes you go insane
Breast to lips to cheek to mane
I'll pull your hair, you'll feel no pain
Are you ready for the only forever we'll both obtain
The only joy in this forsaken game (God forbid)
You'll feel ashamed and ordained (God forbid)
When I lay my hands on you
Nobody knows
Like God knows
Where the deepest part of your river flows
Snap Snap
Undo these nylon hose
Around your thigh my finger goes slowly
Like a cat tip-toes
Until I reach the capstone
I will touch thee in the softest manner
Like "Europa" in the hands of Santana

Are you ready for the touch that makes you go insane
Breast to lips to cheek to mane
I'll pull your hair, you'll feel no pain
Are you ready for the only forever we'll both obtain
The only joy in this forsaken game
You'll feel ashamed and ordained
When I lay my hands on you
When I lay my hands on you



I hold you in my arms as the band plays
What are those words whispered, baby, just as you turn away
I saw you last night out on the edge of town
I wanna read your mind to know just what I've got in this new thing I've found

So tell me what I see when I look in your eyes
Is that you, baby, or just a brilliant disguise?

I heard somebody call your name from underneath our willow
I saw something tucked in shame underneath your pillow
Well I've tried so hard, baby, but I just can't see
What a woman like you is doing with me

So tell me who I see when I look in your eyes
Is that you, baby, or just a brilliant disguise?

Now look at me, baby
Struggling to do everything right
And then it all falls apart
When out go the lights
I'm just a lonely pilgrim
I walk this world in wealth
I want to know if it's you I don't trust
'Cause I damn sure don't trust myself
Now you play the loving woman, I'll play the faithful man
But just don't look too close into the palm of my hand
We stood at the altar, the gypsy swore our future was right
But come the wee wee hours, well maybe, baby, the gypsy lied

So when you look at me, you better look hard and look twice
Is that me, baby, or just a brilliant disguise?

Tonight our bed is cold
I'm lost in the darkness of our love
God have mercy on the man
Who doubts what he's sure of



He blesses the boys as they stand in line
The smell of gun grease
And the bayonets they shine
He's there to help them all that he can
To make them feel wanted he's a good holy man
Sky pilot
Sky pilot
How high can you fly?
You'll never, never, never reach the sky
He smiles at the young soldiers
Tells them it's all right
He knows of their fear in the forthcoming fight
Soon there'll be blood and many will die
Mothers and fathers back home they will cry
Sky pilot
Sky pilot
How high can you fly?
You'll never, never, never reach the sky
He mumbles a prayer and it ends with a smile
The order is given
They move down the line
But he'll stay behind and he'll meditate
But it won't stop the bleeding or ease the hate
As the young men move out into the battle zone
He feels good, with God you're never alone
He feels tired and he lays on his bed
Hopes the men will find courage
In the words that he said
Sky pilot
Sky pilot
How high can you fly?
You'll never, never, never reach the sky
{Instrumental}
You're soldiers of God, you must understand
The fate of your country is in your young hands
May God give you strength
Do your job real well
If it all was worth it
Only time it will tell
In the morning they return
With tears in their eyes
The stench of death drifts up to the skies
A soldier so ill looks at the sky pilot
Remembers the words
"Thou shalt not kill."
Sky pilot
Sky pilot
How high can you fly?
You'll never, never, never reach the sky



When the rain came I thought you'd leave
'Cause I knew how much you loved the sun
But you chose to stay, stay and keep me warm
Through the darkest nights I've ever known
If the mandolin wind couldn't change a thing
Then I know I love ya

Oh, the snow fell without a break
Buffalo died in the frozen fields you know
Through the coldest winter in almost fourteen years
I couldn't believe you kept a smile
Now I can rest assured knowing that we've seen the worst
And I know I love ya

Oh, I never was good with romantic words
So the next few lines come really hard
Don't have much but what I've got is yours
Except of course my steel guitar
Ha, 'cause I know you don't play
But I'll teach you one day
Because I love ya

I recall the night we knelt and prayed
Noticing your face was thin and pale
I found it hard to hide my tears
I felt ashamed I felt I'd let you down
No mandolin wind couldn't change a thing
Couldn't change a thing no, no
Ooh, ooh, ooh
La-da-da, la-la-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da

The coldest winter in almost 14 years
Could never, never change your mind, ooh
And I love ya
Yes indeed, and I love ya
And I love ya
Lordy I love ya, woohoo
And I love ya
Lord, I love ya

There's talk on the street; it sounds so familiar
Great expectations, everybody's watching you
People you meet, they all seem to know you
Even your old friends treat you like you're something new

Johnny-come-lately
The new kid in town
Everybody loves you
So don't let them down

You look in her eyes; the music begins to play
Hopeless romantics, here we go again
But after a while, you're lookin' the other way
It's those restless hearts that never mend

Johnny-come-lately
The new kid in town
Will she still love you
When you're not around?

There's so many things you should have told her
But night after night, you're willing to hold her
Just hold her, tears on your shoulder
There's talk on the street, it's there to remind you
Doesn't really matter which side you're on
You're walking away and they're talking behind you
They will never forget you 'til somebody new comes along

Where you've been lately?
There's a new kid in town
Everybody loves him, don't they?
He's holding her, and you're still around

Oh, my, my
There's a new kid in town
Just another new kid in town
(Ooh, hoo) Everybody's talking 'bout the
(Ooh, hoo) New kid in town
(Ooh, hoo) Everybody's walking like the
(Ooh, hoo) New kid in town
There's a new kid in town
I don't want to hear it
There's a new kid in town
I don't want to hear it, ah ooh
There's a new kid in town
There's a new kid in town
There's a new kid in town
Everybody's talking
There's a new kid in town
People started walking
There's a new kid in town
There's a new kid in town
There's a new kid in town
There's a new kid in town



You could be my silver spring
Blue-green colors flashing
I would be your only dream
Your shining autumn ocean crashing

Don't say that she's pretty
And did you say that she loves you?
Baby, I don't want to know

So I begin not to love you
Turn around, see me running
I say I loved you years ago
But tell myself you never loved me, no

Don't say that she's pretty
And did you say that she loves you?
Baby, I don't want to know

Oh no, and can you tell me was it worth it?
Baby, I don't want to know
Time cast a spell on you
But you won't forget me
I know I could have loved you
But you would not let me


Time cast a spell on you
But you won't forget me
Well, I know I could have loved you
But you would not let me

I follow you down until the sound
Of my voice will haunt you
(Give me just a chance)
You'll never get away from the sound
Of the woman that loved you
Was I just a fool?
I follow you down until the sound
Of my voice will haunt you
(Give me just a chance)
You'll never get away from the sound
Of the woman that loved you
(Was I just a fool)
Time cast a spell on you
But you won't forget me
I know I could have loved you
But you would not let me



She's come undone
She didn't know what she was headed for
And when I found what she was headed for
It was too late
She's come undone
She found a mountain that was far too high
And when she found out she couldn't fly
It was too late

It's too late
She's gone too far
She's lost the sun

She's come undone
She wanted truth, but all she got was lies
Came the time to realize
And it was too late
She's come undone
She didn't know what she was headed for
And when I found what she was headed for
Mama, it was too late
It's too late
She's gone too far
She's lost the sun
She's come undone
No-na-na, no-na-na, no-na-na

Too many mountains and not enough stairs to climb
Too many churches and not enough truth
Too many people and not enough eyes to see
Too many lives to lead and not enough time

It's too late
She's gone too far
She's lost the sun
She's come undone

Doe-doe-doe-doe-doe, doe, un-doe-doe-doe, un-doe-doe-doe

No, no-no-no-no-no, no
Doe, doe, doe-doe

Last October Grammy nominated producer KANYE WEST was in a nearly fatal car accident. His jaw was fractured in nearly three places. Two weeks later he recorded this song with his mouth still wired shut... so the world could feel his pain!

Yo, Gee, they can't stop me from rappin', can they?
Can they, Hop?

Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

I spit it through the wire, man
There's too much stuff on my heart right now, man
I'd gladly risk it all right now
It's a life-or-death situation, man
Y'all, y'all don't really understand how I feel right now, man
It's your boy, Kanye to the…
Chi-Town, what's goin' on?
Uh-huh, yeah, yeah

I drink a Boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dessert
Somebody ordered pancakes, I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man berserk
Not to worry, Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back to wizzerk
How do you console my mom or give her light support
Tellin' her her son's on life support?
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till
She was with me before the deal, she'd been tryna be mine
She a Delta, so she'd been throwin' that Dynasty sign
No use in me tryna be lyin', I been tryna be signed
Tryin' to be a millionaire, how I used two lifelines
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
The doctor said I had blood clots, but I ain't Jamaican, man
Story on MTV and I ain't tryna make a band
I swear, this right here, history in the makin', man
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

I really apologize for everything right now
If it's unclear at all, man
They got my mouth wired shut
For like… I dunno, the doctor said like six weeks
Y'know, he had, I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw
I looked in the mirror
And half my jaw was in the back of my mouth, man
I couldn't believe it
But I'm still here for y'all right now, man
This what I got to say right here, dawg
Yeah, turn me up, yeah, uh

What if somebody from the Chi' that was ill got a deal
On the hottest rap label around?
But he wasn't talkin' 'bout coke and birds
It was more like spoken word, 'cept he's really puttin' it down?
And he explained the story 'bout how Blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude, bad night, right place, wrong time
In the blink of a eye, his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt
You would know how Mase felt (Mason Betha!)
Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt
I swear to God, driver two wanna sue
I got a lawyer for the case, to keep what's in my safe safe
My dawgs couldn't tell if I…
I looked like Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky, it was televised
There's been an accident like GEICO
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must got a angel, ‘cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable, what, you thought they'd call me Mr. Glass?
Look back on my life like the Ghost of Christmas Past
Toys "R" Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown-ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did
But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph
Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

Y'know what I'm sayin'?
When the doctor told me I had, um
That I was gonna have to have a plate in my chin
I said, "Dawg, don't you realize I'll never make it on a plane now?"
"It's bad enough I got all this jewelry on!"
You can't be serious, man



She would never say where she came from
Yesterday don't matter if it's gone
While the sun is bright
Or in the darkest night
No one knows
She comes and goes
Goodbye Ruby Tuesday
Who could hang a name on you?
When you change with every new day
Still I'm going to miss you

Don't question why she needs to be so free
She'll tell you it's the only way to be
She just can't be chained
To a life where nothing's gained
And nothing's lost
At such a cost

Goodbye Ruby Tuesday
Who could hang a name on you?
When you change with every new day
Still I'm going to miss you
"There's no time to lose," I heard her say
"Catch your dreams before they slip away
Dying all the time
Lose your dreams and you
Will lose your mind
Ain't life unkind?"

Goodbye Ruby Tuesday
Who could hang a name on you?
When you change with every new day
Still I'm going to miss you
Goodbye Ruby Tuesday
Who could hang a name on you?
When you change with every new day
Still I'm going to miss you



Ba-ba, ba-ba
Ba-ba, ba-ba

Good sense, innocence, cripplin' mankind
Dead kings, many things I can't define
Occasions, persuasions clutter your mind
Incense and peppermints, the color of time

Who cares what games we choose?
Little to win, but nothin' to lose

Incense and peppermints, meaningless nouns
Turn on, tune in, turn your eyes around
Look at yourself, look at yourself, yeah, girl
Look at yourself, look at yourself, yeah, girl, yeah, yeah

To divide the cockeyed world in two
Throw your pride to one side, it's the least you can do
Beatniks and politics, nothin' is new
A yardstick for lunatics, one point of view
Who cares what games we choose?
Little to win, but nothin' to lose

Good sense, innocence, cripplin' mankind
Dead kings, many things I can't define
Occasions, persuasions clutter your mind
Incense and peppermints, the color of time

Who cares what games we choose?
Little to win, but nothin' to lose

Incense, peppermints
Incense, peppermints
Sha-la-la
Sha-la-la
Sha-la-la

Sha-la-la
Sha-la-la



Walkin' down this rocky road
Wondering where my life is leadin'
Rollin' on to the bitter end
Finding out along the way
What it takes to keep love living
You should know how it feels, my friend

Ooh, I want you to stay
Ooh, I want you today

I'm ready for love
Oh baby, I'm ready for love
Ready for love
Oh baby, I'm ready for love
Yeah, ooh
For your love

Now I'm on my feet again
Better things are bound to happen
All my dues surely must be paid
Many miles and many tears
Times were hard but now they're changing
You should know that I'm not afraid
Ooh, I want you to stay
Ooh, I want you today

I'm ready for love
Oh baby, I'm ready for love
Ready for love
Oh baby, I'm ready for love
Oh I'm ready for love
I'm ready for your love

2:37-3:23

Ooh, I want you to stay
Ooh, I want you today

I'm ready for love
Oh baby, I'm ready for love
Ready for love
Oh baby, I'm ready for love
Ready for love
Oh baby, I'm ready for love
Ready for love
Oh baby, I'm ready for your love
I'm ready for your love
Oh baby



There is unrest in the forest
There is trouble with the trees
For the maples want more sunlight
And the oaks ignore their pleas

The trouble with the maples
And they're quite convinced they're right
They say the oaks are just too lofty
And they grab up all the light
But the oaks can't help their feelings
If they like the way they're made
And they wonder why the maples
Can't be happy in their shade

There is trouble in the forest
And the creatures all have fled
As the maples scream "Oppression!"
And the oaks just shake their heads


So the maples formed a union
And demanded equal rights
"The oaks are just too greedy
We will make them give us light"
Now there's no more oak oppression
For they passed a noble law
And the trees are all kept equal
By hatchet, axe, and saw



Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's got to be rock and roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me

I've got no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And lose the beauty of the melody
Until they sound just like a symphony

That's why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's got to be rock and roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me

I took my loved one over across the tracks
So she can hear my man a wailin' sax
I must admit they have a rocking band
Man, they were blowing like a hurricane
That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's got to be rock and roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me

Way down South they had a jubilee
Them Georgia folks they had a jamboree
They're drinking home brew from a wooden cup
The folks dancing there are all shook up

And started playing that rock and roll music
Any old time you use it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
Got to be rock and roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me

Don't care to hear them play a tango
And in the mood they take a mambo
It's way to early for a congo
So keep a rocking that piano
That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old time you use it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
Oh, you got rock 'n roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me



That night, her kiss told me it was over
I walked out late into the dark
The misty gloom seems to soak up my sorrow
The further I went on, I felt a spreading calm
Then suddenly my eyes were bathed in a light
And the lovely lady in white was by my side
She said, "Like me, I see you're walking alone -
Won't you please stay?"
I couldn't look away

She said I love the night
The day is okay and the sun can be fun
But I live to see those rays slip away
I love the night
There's so much that I can show and give to you
If you will welcome me tonight
If only you had been there, my dear
We could have shared this together

No mortal was meant to know such wonder
One look in the mirror told me so
Come darkness, I'll see her again
Yes I'm gonna go, 'cause now I know
I love the night
The day is okay and the sun can be fun
But I live to see those rays slip away

I love the night
I love the night
I love the night



Timothy Leary's dead
No, no, no, no, he's outside looking in
Timothy Leary's dead
No, no, no, no, he's outside looking in

Along the coast you'll hear them boast
About a light they say that shines so clear
So raise your glass, we'll drink a toast
To the little man who sells you thrills along the pier
He'll take you up, he'll bring you down
He'll plant your feet back firmly on the ground
He flies so high, he swoops so low
He knows exactly which way he's gonna go
Timothy Leary, Timothy Leary
He'll take you up, he'll bring you down
He'll plant your feet back on the ground
He'll fly so high, he'll swoop so low

Ha, ha, ha, I don't believe it
Da, da, ah, ooh, don't touch me
Hey, Ray!
Hey, Sugar!
Tell 'em who we are

Well, we're big rock singers
We got golden fingers
And we're loved everywhere we go (That sounds like us)
We sing about beauty
And we sing about truth
At ten thousand dollars a show (Right!)

We take all kind of pills
That give us all kind of thrills
But the thrill we've never known
Is the thrill that'll get ya
When you get your picture
On the cover of the Rolling Stone

(Rolling Stone) Wanna see my picture on the cover
(Of the Stone) Wanna buy five copies for my mother (Yeah!)
(Stone) Wanna see my smilin' face
On the cover of the Rolling Stone (That's a very, very, good idea!)
 George
I got a freaky ol' lady name o' Cocaine Katy
Who embroiders on my jeans
I got my poor old gray-haired daddy
Drivin' my limousine

Now, it's all designed to blow our minds
But our minds won't really be blown
Like the blow that'll get ya when you get your picture
On the cover of the Rolling Stone

(Rolling Stone) Wanna see our pictures on the cover
(Stone) Wanna buy five copies for our mothers (yeah)
(Stone) Wanna see my smilin' face
On the cover of the Rolling Stone

(Hey, I know how, rock and roll!!)

(Ah, that's beautiful)

We got a lot of little teenage blue-eyed groupies
Who do anything we say
We got a genuine Indian guru
Who's teaching us a better way
We got all the friends that money can buy
So we never have to be alone
And we keep getting richer but we can't get our picture
On the cover of the Rolling Stone

(Rolling Stone) Wanna see my picture on the cover
(Stone) Wanna buy five copies for my mother (I want one!)
(Stone) Wanna see my smilin' face
On the cover of the Rolling Stone
On the cover of the Rolling Stone

Wanna see my picture on the cover
(Man, I don't know why we ain't on the cover, Baby)

(Fresh shot, right up front, man)
On the cover of the Rolling Stone
(I can see it now, we'll be up on the front)
(Smilin', man ... ahh, beautiful!)



Is love so fragile and the heart so hollow
Shatter with words impossible to follow
You're saying I'm fragile, try not to be
I search only for something I can't see
I have my own life
And I am stronger than you know

But I carry this feeling
When you walked into my house
That you won't be walking out the door
Still I carry this feeling
When you walked into my house
That you won't be walking out the door

Lovers forever, face to face
My city, your mountains
Stay with me, stay
I need you to love me
I need you today
Give to me your leather
Take from me my lace

You in the moonlight
With your sleepy eyes
Could you ever love a man like me
And you were right
When I walked into your house
I knew I'd never want to leave
Sometimes I'm a strong man
Sometimes cold and scared
And sometimes I cry
But that time I saw you
I knew with you to light my nights
Somehow I'd get by
First time I saw you
I knew with you to light my nights
Somehow I would get by

Lovers forever, face to face
My city, your mountains
Stay with me, stay
I need you to love me
I need you today
Give to me your leather
Take from me my lace
Lovers forever, face to face
My city, your mountains
Stay with me, stay
I need you to love me
I need you today
Give to me your leather
Take from me my lace



Well, she was an American girl
Raised on promises
She couldn't help thinkin' that there
Was a little more to life somewhere else
After all, it was a great big world
With lots of places to run to
And if she had to die tryin', she
Had one little promise she was gonna keep
Oh yeah, all right
Take it easy, baby
Make it last all night (Make it last all night)
She was an American girl

Well, it was kinda cold that night
She stood alone on her balcony (Ooh)
Yeah, she could hear the cars roll by
Out on 441 like waves crashin' on the beach
And for one desperate moment there
He crept back in her memory
God, it's so painful when something that is so close
Is still so far out of reach
Oh yeah, all right
Take it easy, baby
Make it last all night (Make it last all night)
She was an American girl (Ooh)



Happy Jack wasn't old, but he was a man
He lived in the sand at the Isle of Man.
The kids would all sing, he would take the wrong key
So they rode on his head in their furry donkey

The kids couldn't hurt Jack
They tried, tried, tried
They dropped things on his back
They lied, lied, lied, lied, lied

But they couldn't stop Jack, or the waters lapping
And they couldn't prevent Jack from feeling happy
But they couldn't stop Jack, or the waters lapping
And they couldn't prevent Jack from feeling happy

The kids couldn't hurt Jack
They tried, tried, tried
They dropped things on his back
They lied, lied, lied, lied, lied
But they couldn't stop Jack, or the waters lapping
And they couldn't prevent Jack from being happy

I saw yer!



Yeah, now don't touch the knobs
'Cause I think we're gonna
Have some with this one here
Oh, yeah
You got to give it to me
You got to give it to me
You got to give it to me
You got to give it to me
You're so slick, honey
Know every trick now
You know I want it
I want it so bad
You know I need it
I can't believe it
So come on baby
Please relieve it
Got to give it to me
You got to give it to me
Got to give it to me
You got to give it to me
You've been bugging me
Every night now
You say you want it
You want it right now
I can't get through it
And I can't get to it
So come on, baby, please
Got to get it up (get it up)
Come on, you got to
Get it up (get it up)
You got to get it up (get it up)
Babe, you got to give it to me

You got to give it to me
(Give it to me)
Why keep me cold
When it's so warm inside
Come on, baby, your love
Is too good to hide
Woah, yeah



On the turning away
From the pale and downtrodden
And the words they say
Which we won’t understand
"Don’t accept that what’s happening
Is just a case of all the suffering
Or you’ll find that you’re joining in
The turning away"

It’s a sin that somehow
Light is changing to shadow
And casting its shroud
Over all we have known
Unaware how the ranks have grown
Driven on by a heart of stone
We could find that we’re all alone
In the dream of the proud

On the wings of the night
As the daytime is stirring
Where the speechless unite
In a silent accord
Using words you will find are strange
Mesmerized as they light the flame
Feel the new wind of change
On the wings of the night

No more turning away
From the weak and the weary
No more turning away
From the coldness inside
Just a world that we all must share
It’s not enough just to stand and stare
Is it only a dream that there’ll be
No more turning away?



Star fleet to scout ship, please give your position
Over
I am in orbit around the third planet from the star called the sun
Over
May this be Earth?
Over
Positive. It is known to have some form of intelligent species
Over
I think we should take a look


Strange beautiful grass of green
With your majestic silver seas
Your mysterious mountains I'd wish to see closer
May I land my kinky machine?

Although your world wonders me
With your majestic and superior cackling hen
Your pickle I do not understand
So to you I shall put an end
Then you'll never hear surf music again



It's getting late, have you seen my mates?
Ma, tell me when the boys get here
It's seven o'clock and I wanna rock
Wanna get a belly full of beer
My old man's drunker than a barrel full of monkeys
And my old lady, she don't care
My sister looks cute in her braces and boots
A handful of grease in her hair

Oh, don't give us none of your aggravation
We had it with your discipline
Oh, Saturday night's alright for fighting
Get a little action in
Get about as oiled as a diesel train
Gonna set this dance alight
'Cause Saturday night's the night I like
Saturday night's alright, alright, alright, ooh

Well, they're packed pretty tight in here tonight
I'm looking for a dolly who'll see me right
I may use a little muscle to get what I need
I may sink a little drink and shout out, "She's with me!"
A couple of the sounds that I really like
Are the sounds of a switchblade and a motorbike
I'm a juvenile product of the working class
Whose best friend floats in the bottom of a glass
Oh, don't give us none of your aggravation
We had it with your discipline
Saturday night's alright for fighting
Get a little action in
Get about as oiled as a diesel train
Gonna set this dance alight
'Cause Saturday night's the night I like
Saturday night's alright, alright, alright, ooh


Oh, don't give us none of your aggravation
We had it with your discipline
'Cause Saturday night's alright for fighting
Get a little action in
Get about as oiled as a diesel train
Gonna set this dance alight
'Cause Saturday night's the night I like
Saturday night's alright, alright, alright, ooh

Saturday! Saturday! Saturday!

Saturday! Saturday! Saturday!
Saturday! Saturday! Saturday!
Saturday! Saturday! Saturday night's alright

I have just closed my eyes again
Climbed aboard the Dream Weaver train
Driver take away my worries of today
And leave tomorrow behind

Ooh, Dream Weaver
I believe you can get me through the night
Ooh, Dream Weaver
I believe we can reach the morning light

Fly me high through the starry skies
Or maybe to an astral plane
Cross the highways of fantasy
Help me to forget today's pain

Ooh, Dream Weaver
I believe you can get me through the night
Ooh, Dream Weaver
I believe we can reach the morning light

Though the dawn may be coming soon
There still may be some time
Fly me away to the bright side of the moon
And meet me on the other side
Ooh, Dream Weaver
I believe you can get me through the night
Ooh, Dream Weaver
I believe we can reach the morning light

Dream Weaver

Welcome, my son
Welcome to the machine
Where have you been?
It's alright, we know where you've been
You've been in the pipeline, filling in time
Provided with toys and 'Scouting for Boys'
You bought a guitar to punish your ma
You didn't like school
And you know you're nobody's fool
So welcome to the machine

Welcome, my son
Welcome to the machine
What did you dream?
It's alright, we told you what to dream
You dreamed of a big star
He played a mean guitar
He always ate in the Steak Bar
He loved to drive in his Jaguar
So welcome to the machine



I must have been through about a million girls
I'd love 'em then I'd leave 'em alone
I didn't care how much they cried, no sir
Their tears left me cold as a stone

But then I fooled around and fell in love
I fooled around and fell in love, yes I did
I fooled around and fell in love
I fooled around and fell in love

It used to be when I'd see a girl that I liked
I'd get out my book and write down her name
Ah, but when the, the grass got a little greener over on the other side
I'd just tear out that page

But then I fooled around and fell in love
I fooled around and fell in love, since I met you baby
I fooled around and fell in love
I fooled around and fell in love

Free, on my own is the way I used to be
Ah, but since I met you baby, love's got a hold on me
(Fooled around and fell in love)
It's got a hold on me now
(Fooled around and fell in love)
I can't let go of you baby
(Fooled around and fell in love)
I can't stop loving you now
(Fooled around and fell in love)
'Cause I fooled around, I fooled around, I fooled around, I fooled around
I fooled around, I fooled around, and I fell in love
I fooled around, I fooled around,  yes I did, I fooled around
I fooled around (and I fell in love), I fooled around
'Cause I fooled around, and I fell in love
I fooled around
I fooled around, and I fell in love
Some of you know what I am trying to say



Give me a ticket for an aeroplane

Oh, the lonely days are gone

Is it getting better
Or do you feel the same?
Will it make it easier on you, now
You got someone to blame?

You say one love, one life
When it's one need in the night
One love, we get to share it
Leaves you, baby, if you don't care for it

Did I disappoint you
Or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
You act like you never had love
And you want me to go without

Well, it's too late tonight
To drag the past out into the light
We're one, but we're not the same
We get to carry each other, carry each other
One

Have you come here for forgiveness?
Have you come to raise the dead?
Have you come here to play Jesus
To the lepers in your head?
Did I ask too much? More than a lot
You gave me nothing, now it's all I got
We're one, but we're not the same
Well, we hurt each other, then we do it again

You say love is a temple, love a higher law
Love is a temple, love the higher law
You ask me to enter, but then you make me crawl
And I can't be holding on to what you got
When all you got is hurt

One love, one blood
One life, you got to do what you should
One life with each other
Sisters, brothers
One life, but we're not the same
We get to carry each other, carry each other
One
One

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh-ooh
May we, may we, may we get
Higher
Oh, higher
(Ay, yeah, go) higher
(Oh) Higher



One is the loneliest number that you'll ever do
Two can be as bad as one
It's the loneliest number since the number one

No is the saddest experience you'll ever know
Yes, it's the saddest experience you'll ever know
'Cause one is the loneliest number that you'll ever do
One is the loneliest number, whoa-oh, worse than two

It's just no good anymore since you went away
Now I spend my time just making rhymes of yesterday

One is the loneliest number
One is the loneliest number
One is the loneliest number that you'll ever do
One is the loneliest
One is the loneliest
One is the loneliest number that you'll ever do

It's just no good anymore since you went away
(Number)
One is the loneliest (number)
One is the loneliest (number)
One is the loneliest number that you'll ever do (number)
One is the loneliest (number)
One is the loneliest (number)
One is the loneliest number that you'll ever do (number)
One (one is the loneliest number that you'll ever do)(number)
One is the loneliest number that you'll ever do (number)
One is the loneliest number that you'll ever do



I was eight years old and running with a dime in my hand
Into the bus stop to pick up a paper for my old man
I'd sit on his lap in that big old Buick
And steer as we drove through town
He'd tousle my hair and say "Son, take a good look around
This is your hometown."
This is your hometown
This is your hometown
This is your hometown
In '65 tension was running high at my high school
There was a lot of fights 'tween the black and white
There was nothing you could do
Two cars at a light on a Saturday night
In the back seat there was a gun
Words were passed, then a shotgun blast
Troubled times had come to my hometown
To my hometown
To my hometown
To my hometown
Now Main Street's whitewashed windows and vacant stores
Seems like there ain't nobody wants to come down here no more
They're closing down the textile mill across the railroad tracks
Foreman says "These jobs are going, boys
And they ain't coming back
To your hometown."
To your hometown
To your hometown
To your hometown
Last night me and Kate, we laid in bed
Talking about getting out
Packing up our bags maybe heading south
I'm thirty-five, we got a boy of our own now
Last night I sat him up behind the wheel, and said
"Son take a good look around
This is your hometown."
Songwriter:  Bruce Springsteen



I should have known better with a girl like you
That I would love everything that you do
And I do, hey, hey, hey, and I do

Whoa, oh, I never realized what a kiss could be
This could only happen to me
Can't you see, can't you see

That when I tell you that I love you, oh
You're going to say you love me too, oh
And when I ask you to be mine
You're gonna say you love me too

So I should have realized a lot of things before
If this is love you've got to give me more
Give me more, hey hey hey, give me more


Whoa, oh, I never realized what a kiss could be
This could only happen to me
Can't you see, can't you see
That when I tell you that I love you, oh
You're going to say you love me too, oh
And when I ask you to be mine
You're going to say you love me too

You love me too, you love me too
You love me too



Mmm num ba de
Dum bum ba be
Doo buh dum ba beh beh

Pressure pushing down on me
Pressing down on you, no man ask for
Under pressure that burns a building down
Splits a family in two
Puts people on streets
Um ba ba be
Um ba ba be
De day da
Ee day da- that's okay

It's the terror of knowing what this world is about
Watching some good friends screaming, "Let me out!"
Pray tomorrow gets me higher
Pressure on people, people on streets

Day day de mm hm
Da da da ba ba
Okay
Chipping around, kick my brains around the floor
These are the days it never rains but it pours
Ee do ba be
Ee da ba ba ba
Um bo bo
Be lap
People on streets
Ee da de da de
People on streets
Ee da de da de da de da
It's the terror of knowing what this world is about
Watching some good friends screaming, 'Let me out'
Pray tomorrow gets me higher, high
Pressure on people, people on streets

Turned away from it all like a blind man
Sat on a fence but it don't work
Keep coming up with love but it's so slashed and torn
Why, why, why?
Love, love, love, love, love
Insanity laughs under pressure we're breaking

Can't we give ourselves one more chance?
Why can't we give love that one more chance?
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love
Give love, give love, give love, give love, give love?

Because love's such an old-fashioned word
And love dares you to care for
The people on the (People on streets) edge of the night
And love (People on streets) dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance
This is ourselves under pressure
Under pressure
Under pressure
Pressure



Boogie up, boogie down
Shake your body to the groove
Sing it high, sing it low
Dancin', dancin', dancin' 
Boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie
Boogie boogie all night long
Boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie
Boogie boogie to the songs
The hits of '69
Keep on goin' up the vibe
Like Credence CCR
 to the star
And here they come again
 shook, ooh, ooh

Sugar, ah honey honey
You are my candy girl
And you've got me wanting you
(want you to CCR)

(Solo)
Well
Think of your fellow man
Lend him a helping hand
Put a little love in your heart
If you want the world to know
We won't let hatred grow
Put a little love in your heart
And the world will be a better place
For you and me
You just wait and see

Na na na na, na na na na, hey hey, goodbye
Na na na na, na na na na, hey hey, goodbye

This is the dawning of the age of Aquarius
The age of Aquarius
Aquarius
Aquarius

Thinkin' 'bout the times you drove in my car
Thinkin' that I might have drove you too far
And I'm thinkin' 'bout the love that you laid on my table
Who's to ask how many times I found you
Standing wet and naked in the garden

Took the train from Casablanca going South
Blowing smoke rings from the corners of my mouth, my mouth, my mouth
Ducks and pigs and chickens call, animal carpet wall to wall
American ladies five-foot tall in blue
Don't you know we're riding on the Marrakesh Express?
Don't you know we're riding on the Marrakesh Express?
They're taking me to Marrakesh
Come on board (toot toot) to Woodstock

By the time we got to Woodstock
We were half a million strong
And everywhere was a song
And a celebration
We are stardust, we are golden
We are caught in the devil's bargain
And we got to get ourselves
Back to the garden
Gimme an F (F!)
U (U!)
C (C!)
K (K!)
What's that spell? (Fuck!)
What's that spell? (Fuck!)

Living, loving, she's just a woman

Well, the leaders of our time choose to remain blind. Let us sing and dance, and rejoice, and braze the new. Hail Atlantis!
Way down below the ocean where I wanna be she may be

Woo woo woo-woo, woo-woo-woo, woo woo-woo
Woo woo woo-woo, woo-woo-woo, woo woo-woo
You gotta hit the beat, you gotta hit the beat
One, two, three, four

So long, Frank Lloyd Wright
All of the nights we'd harmonize till dawn
I never laughed so long
So long
So long

Standing at the docks at Southampton
Trying to get to Holland or France
The man in the mac said, "You've got to go back"
You know he never even give us a chance
Christ you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're gonna crucify

John
Yoko
John
Yoko
John
Yoko

Shall I tell you about my life
They say I'm a man of the world
And there's no one I'd rather be
But I just wish that I'd never been born

When the day is done
Some get by but some get old
Just to show life's not made of gold
When the day is done

Linger on pale blue eyes
Linger on pale blue eyes

Frank Zappa!

Miles runs the voodoo down
He runs the voodoo down
Miles runs the voodoo down
We run that voodoo down

The creator has a master plan
Peace and happiness throughout the land
The creator has a working plan
Peace and happiness throughout the land
The creator has a master plan
Peace and happiness throughout the land
The creator has a master plan
Peace and happiness throughout the land

A salty dog, a seaman's log
And no one left alive

Make your own kind of music
Sing your own special song
Make your own kind of music
Even if nobody else sings along

Woo woo woo-woo, woo-woo-woo, woo woo-woo
Woo woo woo-woo, woo-woo-woo, woo woo-woo
The hits of '69 keep on blowing up your mind
Remember "Day is Done", "John and Yoko" sure was fun
Frank Zappa, Miles, give the gift of fun, ah ah ah
Woo woo woo-woo, woo-woo-woo, woo woo-woo
Woo woo woo-woo, woo-woo-woo, woo woo-woo



There are stars
In the Southern sky
Southward as you go
There is moonlight
And moss in the trees

Down the Seven Bridges Road

Now I have loved you like a baby
Like some lonesome child
And I have loved you in a tame way
And I have loved you wild
Sometimes there's a part of me
Has to turn from here and go
Running like a child from these warm stars

Down the Seven Bridges Road

There are stars in the Southern sky
And if ever you decide
You should go
There is a taste of thyme sweetened honey
Down the Seven Bridges Road



It's the same kind of story
That seems to come down from long ago
Two friends having coffee together
When something flies by their window
It might be out on that lawn
Which is wide, at least half of a playing field
Because there's no explaining
What your imagination can make you see and feel

Seems like a dream
They got me hypnotized

Now it's not a meaningless question
To ask if they've been and gone
I remember a talk about North Carolina
And a strange, strange pond
You see the sides were like glass
In the thick of a forest without a road
And if any man's hand ever made that land
Then I think it would've showed

That's why it seems like a dream
They got me hypnotized
I know that's right

Seems like a dream
They got me hypnotized

They say there's a place down in Mexico
Where a man can fly over mountains and hills
And he don't need an airplane or some kind of engine
And he never will
Now you know it's a meaningless question to ask
If those stories are right
Because what matters most
Is the feeling you get when you're hypnotized

Seems like a dream
They got me hypnotized
Seems like a dream
They got me hypnotized
Seems like a dream
They got me hypnotized
Yeaaaaahhhh, that's when, that's when they got you hypnotized
Seems like a dream
They got me hypnotized
Seems like a dream
Seems like a dream
They got me hypnotized



I ain't superstitious, black cat crossed my trail
I ain't superstitious but a black cat crossed my trail
Bad luck ain't got me so far and I won't let it stop me now

The dogs begin to bark all over my neighbourhood
And that ain't all
Dogs begin to bark all over my neighbourhood
Mmm-mmm
This is a mean old world to live in and I can't face it all by myself
At all


And dogs begin to bark all over my neighbourhood
The dogs begin to bark all over my neighbourhood
I got a feelin' about the future and it ain't too good, I know that
I know, I know, I know now


Ain't superstitious but a black cat crossed my trail
I said so one time before
Ain't superstitious, a black cat crossed my trail
Bad luck ain't got me so far and you know I ain't gonna let it stop me now
Come on



There've been so many girls that I've known
I've made so many cry and still I wonder why
Here comes the little girl
I see her walking down the street
She is all by herself
I try and knock her off her feet

But, she'll never break, never break
Never break, never break this heart of stone
Oh, no, no, this heart of stone

What's different about her?
I don't really know
No matter how I try
I just can't make her cry

'Cause she'll never break, never break
Never break, never break
This heart of stone
Oh, no, no, no, this heart of stone

Don't keep on looking that same old way
If you try acting sad, you will only make me glad
Better listen little girl
You go on walking down the street
I ain't got no love, I ain't the kind to meet
'Cause she'll never break, never break
Never break, never break
This heart of stone

Oh, no, no, no
You'll never break this heart of stone, darling
No, no, this heart of stone
You'll never break it, darling
You won't break this heart of stone
Oh, no, no, no
You better go, you better go home
'Cause you'll, you'll never break this heart of stone
You better, you better drive on home



One, two, three, four

I just want to celebrate another day of livin'
I just want to celebrate another day of life

I put my faith in the people
But the people let me down
So I turned the other way
And I carry on, anyhow

That's why I'm telling you
I just want to celebrate, yeah, yeah
Another day of living, yeah
I just want to celebrate another day of life

Had my hand on the dollar bill
And the dollar bill flew away
But the sun is shining down on me
And it's here to stay

That's why I'm telling you
I just want to celebrate, yeah, yeah
Another day of living, yeah
I just want to celebrate another day of livin'
I just want to celebrate another day of life
Don't let it all get you down, no, no
Don't let it turn you around and round and round and round and round
Well, I can't be bothered with sorrow
And I can't be bothered with hate, no, no
I'm using up the time but feeling fine, every day

That's why I'm telling you
I just want to celebrate, oh, yeah
I just want to celebrate another day
Oh, I just want to celebrate another day of livin'
I just want to celebrate another day of life

Don't let it all get you down, no, no
Don't let it turn you around and round
Round, round, round
Don't go round

I just want to celebrate
I just want to celebrate
Well, I just want to celebrate
Said I just want to celebrate (celebrate)
I just want to celebrate (I want to celebrate)
I just want to celebrate (I got to celebrate)
I just want to celebrate



Was an early morning yesterday
I was up before the dawn
And I really have enjoyed my stay
But I must be moving on
Like a king without a castle, like a queen without a throne
I'm an early morning lover, and I must be moving on
Yeah yeah

Now I believe in what you say
Is the undisputed truth
But I have to have things my own way
To keep me in my youth
Like a ship without an anchor, like a slave without a chain
Just the thought of those sweet ladies sends a shiver through my veins
And I will go on shining, shining like brand new
I'll never look behind me, my troubles will be few

Goodbye stranger, it's been nice
Hope you'll find your paradise
Tried to see your point of view
Hope your dreams will all come true
Goodbye, Mary, goodbye, Jane
Will we ever meet again?
Feel no sorrow, feel no shame
Come tomorrow, feel no pain
Sweet devotion (Goodbye, Mary), it's not for me (Goodbye, Jane)
Just give me motion (Will we ever) and set me free (Meet again?)
And land and the ocean (Feel no sorrow), far away (Feel no shame)
The life I've chosen (Come tomorrow), every day (Feel no pain)
So goodbye, Mary (Goodbye, Mary), goodbye, Jane (Goodbye, Jane)
Will we ever (Will we ever) meet again? (Meet again?)
Now, some they do and some they don't
And some you just can't tell
And some they will and some they won't
With some it's just as well
You can laugh at my behaviour, that'll never bother me
Say, the devil is my saviour, but I don't pay no heed
And I will go on shining, shining like brand new
I'll never look behind me, my troubles will be few

Goodbye stranger, it's been nice
Hope you find your paradise
Tried to see your point of view
Hope your dreams will all come true
Goodbye, Mary, goodbye, Jane
Will we ever meet again?
Feel no sorrow, feel no shame
Come tomorrow, feel no pain
Sweet devotion (Goodbye, Mary), it's not for me (Goodbye, Jane)
Just give me motion (Will we ever) and set me free (Meet again?)
And land and the ocean (Feel no sorrow), far away (Feel no shame)
The life I've chosen (Come tomorrow), every day (Feel no pain)
And now I'm leaving (Goodbye, Mary), got to go (Goodbye, Jane)
Hit the road (Will we ever), I say it once again (Meet again?)
Oh yes, I'm leaving (Feel no sorrow), got to go (Feel no shame)
Got to go (Come tomorrow), I'm sorry I must tell you (Feel no pain)
Goodbye, Mary (Goodbye, Mary), goodbye, Jane (Goodbye, Jane)
Will we ever (Will we ever) meet again? (Meet again?)
Go and believe it



It was late last night
I was feeling something wasn't right
There was not another soul in sight
Only you, only you
So we walked along
Though I knew that there was something wrong
And a feeling hit me, oh so strong
About you

Then you gazed up at me
And the answer was plain to see
'Cause I saw the light
In your eyes (in your eyes)
In your eyes (in your eyes)

Though we had our fling (we had our fling)
I just never would suspect a thing (suspect a thing)
'Til that little bell began to ring (began to ring)
In my head, in my head
But I tried to run (I tried to run)
Though I knew it wouldn't help me none (would not help me none)
'Cause I couldn't ever love no one
Or so I said
But my feelings for you
Were just something I never knew
'Til I saw the light
In your eyes (in your eyes)
In your eyes (in your eyes)


But I love you best
It's not something that I say in jest
'Cause you're different, girl, from all the rest
In my eyes

And I ran out before
But I won't do it anymore
Can't you see the light in my eyes (in my eyes)

In my eyes (in my eyes)
In my eyes (in my eyes)
In my eyes (in my eyes)
In my eyes (in my eyes)



I would walk ten miles on my hands and knees
Ain't no doubt about it baby, it's you I aim to please
I'd wrestle with a lion and a grizzly bear
It's my life baby but I don't care

Ain't that tough enough?
Ain't that tough enough?
Ain't that tough enough?
Ain't that tough enough?

For you baby I would swim the sea
Nothin' I'd do for you that's too tough for me
I'd put out a burnin' building with a shovel and dirt
And not even worry about getting hurt

Ain't that tough enough?
Ain't that tough enough?
Ain't that tough enough?
Ain't that tough enough?

I'd work twenty four hours, seven days a week
Just so I could come home and kiss your cheek
I'll love you in the mornin' and I'll love you at noon
I'll love you in the night and take you to the moon
Ain't that tough enough?
Ain't that tough enough?
Ain't that tough enough?
Ain't that tough enough?

I'd lay in a pile of burnin' money that I've earned
And not even worry about getting burned
I'd climb the Empire State, fight Muhammad Ali
Just to have you baby close to me

Ain't that tough enough?
Ain't that tough enough?
Ain't that tough enough?
Ain't that tough enough?
Ain't that tough enough?
Ain't that tough enough?
Ain't that tough enough?
Ain't that tough enough?
Ain't that tough enough?
Ain't that tough enough?



I told you 'bout Strawberry Fields
You know the place where nothing is real
Well here's another place you can go
Where everything flows

Looking through the bent back tulips
To see how the other half lives
Looking through a glass onion

I told you 'bout the walrus and me, man
You know that we're as close as can be, man
Well, here's another clue for you all
The walrus was Paul

Standing on the cast iron shore, yeah
Lady Madonna trying to make ends meet, yeah
Looking through a glass onion

Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Looking through a glass onion
I told you 'bout the fool on the hill
I tell you, man, he living there still
Well, here's another place you can be
Listen to me

Fixing a hole in the ocean
Trying to make a dove-tail joint, yeah
Looking through a glass onion



Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it

She loves to laugh
She loves to sing

What good love could do
Ooh, then we touched
Then we sang
About the loving things

We swallow the odors of Southern cities,
Fat back boiled to submission,
Tender evening poignancies of
Magnolia and the great green
Smell of fresh sweat.
In Southern fields,
The sound of distant
Feet running, or dancing,
And the liquid notes of
Sorrow songs,
Waltzes, screams and
French quadrilles float over
The loam of Georgia.

Sing me to sleep, Savannah.

Clocks run down in Tara’s halls and dusty
Flags droops their unbearable
Sadness.

Remember our days, Susannah.

Oh, the blood-red clay,
Wet still with ancient
Wrongs, and Abenaa
Singing her Creole airs to Macon.
We long, dazed, for winter evenings
And a whitened moon,
And the snap of controllable fires.

Cry for our souls, Augusta.

We need a wind to strike
Sharply, as the thought of love
Betrayed can stop the heart
An absence of tactile
Romance, no lips offering
Succulence, nor eyes
Rolling disconnected from
A Sambo face.

Dare us new dreams, Columbus.

A cool new moon, a
Winter’s night, calm blood,
Sluggish, moving only
Out of habit, we need
Peace.

Oh Atlanta, oh deep, and
Once lost city,

Chant for us a new song. A song
Of Southern peace.We swallow the odors of Southern cities,

She laughed in my face, told me good-bye
Said "Don't think about it, you can go crazy
Anything can happen, anything can end
Don't try to fight it, don't try to save me"
She's a woman in love
And he's gonna break her heart to pieces
She don't wanna see
She's a woman in love, but it's not me
Well alright, do what you want
Don't try to talk, don't say nothing
She used to be the kind of woman
You have and you hold, she could understand the problem
She let the little things go
She's a woman in love
And he's gonna break her heart to pieces
But she don't wanna know
She's a woman in love, she can't let go
Time after time, night after night
She would look up at me
And say she was lonely
I don't understand the world today
I don't understand what she needed
I gave her everything she threw it all away
On nothin'
She's a woman in love



{Instrumental Opening}
You think we look pretty good together
You think my shoes are made of leather
But I'm a substitute for another guy
I look pretty tall but my heels are high
The simple things you see are all complicated
I look pretty young, but I'm just back-dated, yeah
Substitute your lies for fact
I see right through your plastic mac
I look all white, but my dad was black
My fine looking suit is really made out of sack
I was born with a plastic spoon in my mouth
The north side of my town faced east, and the east was facing south
And now you dare to look me in the eye
Those crocodile tears are what you cry
It's a genuine problem, you won't try
To work it out at all you just pass it by, pass it by
Substitute me for him
Substitute my coke for gin
Substitute you for my mum
At least I'll get my washing done

I caught you knockin' at my cellar door
I love you, baby, can I have some more?
Ooh, ooh, the damage done

I hit the city and I lost my band
I watched the needle take another man
Gone, gone, the damage done

I sing the song, because I love the man
I know that some of you don't understand
Milk-blood to keep from running out

I've seen the needle and the damage done
A little part of it in everyone
But every junkie's like a settin' sun



These eyes
Cry every night
For you
These arms
Long to hold you
Again

The hurtin's on me, yeah
And I will never be free

Mama told me when I was young
"Come sit beside me, my only son
And listen closely to what I say
And if you do this, it'll help you some sunny day, ah yeah"

(Be a simple man)

Oh, take your time, don't live too fast
Troubles will come and they will pass
You'll find a woman, yeah, and you'll find love
And don't forget, son, there is someone up above

And be a simple kind of man
Oh, be something you love and understand
Baby, be a simple kind of man
Oh, won't you do this for me, son, if you can?

Forget your lust for the rich man's gold
All that you need is in your soul
And you can do this, oh, baby, if you try
All that I want for you, my son, is to be satisfied
And be a simple kind of man
Oh, be something you love and understand
Baby, be a simple kind of man
Oh, won't you do this for me, son, if you can?
Oh, yes, I will


Boy, don't you worry, you'll find yourself
Follow your heart and nothing else
And you can do this, oh, baby, if you try
All that I want for you, my son, is to be satisfied

And be a simple kind of man
Oh, be something you love and understand
Baby, be a simple kind of man
Oh, won't you do this for me, son, if you can?

Baby, be a simple, be a simple man
Oh, be something you love and understand
Baby, be a simple kind of man

Cancel my subscription to the Resurrection
Send my credentials to the House of Detention
I got some friends inside
The face in the mirror won't stop
The girl in the window won't drop
A feast of friends, "Alive!" she cried
Waiting for me outside
Before I sink into the big sleep
I want to hear
I want to hear
The scream of the butterfly
Come back, baby
Back into my arm
We're gettin' tired of hangin' around
Waitin' around with our heads to the ground
I hear a very gentle sound
Very near yet, very far
Very soft, yeah, very clear
Come today, come today
What have they done to the earth, yeah?
What have they done to our fair sister?
Ravaged and plundered and ripped her and bit her
Stuck her with knives in the side of the dawn
And tied her with fences and dragged her down
I hear a very gentle sound
With your ear down to the ground
We want the world and we want it
We want the world and we want it
Now
Now?
Now!
Persian night babe
See the light, babe
Save us
Jesus
Save us

So when the music's over
When the music's over, yeah
When the music's over
Turn out the lights
Turn out the lights
Turn out the lights

Well, the music is your special friend
Dance on fire as it intends
Music is your only friend
Until the end

Well, I don't know why I came here tonight
I got the feeling that something ain't right
I'm so scared in case I fall off my chair
And I'm wondering how I'll get down the stairs

Clowns to the left of me
Jokers to the right
Here I am
Stuck in the middle with you

Yes, I'm stuck in the middle with you
And I'm wondering what it is I should do
It's so hard to keep this smile from my face
Losing control, yeah, I'm all over the place

Clowns to the left of me
Jokers to the right
Here I am
Stuck in the middle with you

Well, you started out with nothing
And you're proud that you're a self-made man
And your friends, they all come crawling
Slap you on the back and say
Please
Please
Trying to make some sense of it all
But I can see it makes no sense at all
Is it cool to go to sleep on the floor?
'Cause I don't think that I can take anymore

Clowns to the left of me
Jokers to the right
Here I am
Stuck in the middle with you

And you started out with nothing
And you're proud that you're a self-made man
And your friends, they all come crawling
Slap you on the back and say
Please
Please

Yeah I don't know why I came here tonight
I got the feeling that something ain't right
I'm so scared in case I fall off my chair
And I'm wondering how I'll get down the stairs
Clowns to the left of me
Jokers to the right
Here I am
Stuck in the middle with you

Yes, I'm stuck in the middle with you
Stuck in the middle with you
Here I am
Stuck in the middle with you



Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise

Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these sunken eyes and learn to see
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to be free

Blackbird fly, blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night


Blackbird fly, blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night

Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
You were only waiting for this moment to arise



Midnight on the water
I saw the ocean's daughter
Walking on a wave she came
Staring as she called my name

And I can't get it out of my head
No, I can't get it out of my head
Now my old world is gone for dead
'Cause I can't get it out of my head

Breakdown on the shoreline
Can't move, it's an ebb tide
Morning don't get here 'til night
Searching for her silver light

And I can't get it out of my head
No, I can't get it out of my head
Now my old world is gone for dead
'Cause I can't get it out of my head, no, no

Bank job in the city
Robin Hood, William Tell, Ivanhoe, and Lancelot
They don't envy me, yeah
Sitting 'til the sun goes down
In dreams, the world keeps going
'Round and 'round

And I can't get it out of my head
No, I can't get it out of my head
Now my old world is gone for dead
'Cause I can't get it out of my head, no, no

Oh, I can't get it out of my head
No, I can't get it out of my head
Now my old world is gone for dead
'Cause I can't get it out of my head, no, no, no, no



Rosanna's daddy had a car she loved to drive
Stole the keys one night and took me for a ride
Turned up the music just as loud as it could go
Blew out the speakers in her daddy's radio
She was shakin' (oh oh ooo oh)
Snappin' her fingers (oh oh ooo oh)
She was movin' round and round (oh oh ooo oh)
That girl was shakin' (oh oh ooo oh)
We started drinkin' wasn't thinkin' too straight
She was doin' 80 and she slammed on the brakes
Got so high we had to pull to the side
Her tits were shakin' 'til the middle of the night
Shakin' (oh oh ooo oh)
Snappin' her fingers (oh oh ooo oh)
She was up and down and round and round
Shakin' (oh oh ooo oh)
Shakin' (oh oh ooo oh) (oh oh ooo oh)

I got a little nervous
When she took her coat off
She looked so pretty
Ahh yeah

I love that little girl and I just can't get enough
It takes a lonely night with nowhere to go
Just call Rosanna, it's a hell of a show
And she's shakin' (oh oh ooo oh)
Snappin' her fingers (oh oh ooo oh)
She'll be movin' round and round (oh oh ooo oh)
Oh she's shakin' (oh oh ooo oh)
Shakin' (oh oh ooo oh)

Well love is love and not fade away

For you to know just how I feel
Love is real and not fade away

I'm going to tell you how it's going to be
You're going to give your love to me
I'm going to love you night and day
Well love is love and not fade away

Johnny was a schoolboy when he heard his first Beatles song
'Love Me Do,' I think it was. From there it didn't take him long
Got himself a guitar, used to play every night
Now he's in a rock 'n' roll outfit and everything's all right
Don't you know?
Johnny told his mama, "Hey, Mama, I'm goin' away
I'm gonna hit the big time, gonna be a big star someday."
Mama came to the door with a teardrop in her eye
Johnny said, "Don't cry, Mama," smiled and waved good-bye
Don't you know, yeah yeah, Don't you know that you are a shooting star
Don't you know, don't you know. Don't you know that you are
A shooting star
And all the world will love you just as long
As long as you are
Johnny made a record, went straight up to number one
Suddenly everyone loved to hear him sing his song
Watching the world go by, surprising it goes so fast
Johnny looked around him and said, 'Well, I made the big time at last'
Don't you know, don't you know, don't you know that you are
A shooting star
Don't you know, oh, yeah, don't you know that you are
A shooting star, yeah
And all the world will love you just as long
As long as you are, a shooting star
Don't you know that you are a shooting star, Don't you know, yeah
Don't you know that you are a shooting star, now
And all the world will love you just as long, As long you are you
Johnny died one night, died in his bed
Bottle of whiskey, sleeping tablets by his head
Johnny's life passed him by like a warm summer day
If you listen to the wind, you can still hear him play
Oh oh oh, Don't you know that you are a shooting star
Don't you know, yeah, don't you know', Don't you know that
You are a shooting star
Don't you know, yeah
Don't you know that you are a shooting star
Don't you, don't you
Don't you, don't you
Don't you know, don't you
Know, oh, yeah, you are
Yeah, a shooting star, yeah, oh
Oh oh oh oh......
Don't you, don't you know
That you are a shooting star
Don't you don't you know......



I can see why you think you belong to me
I never tried to make you think or let you see
One thing for yourself
But now you're off with someone else and I'm alone
You see, I thought that I might keep you for my own
Amie, what you wanna do?
I think I could stay with you
For a while, maybe longer if I do
Don't you think the time is right for us to find
All the things we thought weren't proper could be right in time?
And can you see which way we should turn, together or alone?
I can never see what's right or what is wrong
Oh, you take too long
Amie, what you wanna do?
I think I could stay with you
For a while, maybe longer if I do
Well, Amie, what you wanna do?
I think I could stay with you
For a while, maybe longer if I do
Now it's come to what you want, you've had your way
And all the things you thought before just faded into gray
And can you see that I don't know if it's you or if it's me?
If it's one of us, I'm sure we both will see
Won't you look at me and tell me
Amie, what you wanna do?
I think I could stay with you
For a while, maybe longer if I, longer if I do, yeah, now
Amie, what you wanna do?
I think I could stay with you
For a while, maybe longer if I do
I keep falling in and out of love with you
Falling in and out of love with you
Don't know what I'm gonna do
I keep falling in and out of love with you



She don't love me
She loves my automobile
She don't love me
She loves my automobile
But she would do anything
Just to slide behind the wheel

She said, "What's it going to take
For you to lay your top on down?"
She said, "What's it going to take
For you to lay your top on down?"
I said, "Honey, why don't you ask me
When we get to the outskirts of town?"

Well, now she don't care
If I'm stoned or sloppy drunk
Well she don't care
If I'm stoned or sloppy drunk
Long as she got the keys
And there's a spare wheel in her trunk



My love is in league with the freeway
Its passion will ride, as the cities fly by
And the tail-lights dissolve, in the coming of night
And the questions in thousands take flight
My love is the miles and the waiting
The eyes that just stare, and the glance at the clock
And the secret that burns
And the pain that won't stop
And its fuel is the years
Leading me on - leading me down the road
Driving beyond
Driving me down the road
My love is exceeding the limit
Red-eyed and fevered with the hum of the miles
Distance and longing, my thoughts do collide
Should I rest for a while at the side
Your love is cradled in knowing
Eyes in the mirror, still expecting they'll come
Sensing too well when the journey is done
There is no turning back
No
There is no turning back
On the run
My love is in league with the freeway
Oh the freeway, and
The coming of night-time
My love
My love is in league with the freeway



Somewhere in a lonely hotel room
There's a guy starting to realize
That his eternal fate has turned its back on him
It's two A.M
It's two A.M., the fear has gone
I'm sitting here waitin', the gun still warm
Maybe my connection is tired of takin' chances
Yeah, there's a storm on the loose, sirens in my head
Wrapped up in silence, all circuits are dead
Cannot decode, my whole life spins into a frenzy
Help, I'm steppin' into the Twilight Zone
Place is a madhouse, feels like being cloned
My beacon's been moved under moon and star
Where am I to go now that I've gone too far?
Help, I'm steppin' into the Twilight Zone
Place is a madhouse, feels like being cloned
My beacon's been moved under moon and star
Where am I to go now that I've gone too far?
Soon you will come to know
When the bullet hits the bone
Soon you will come to know
When the bullet hits the bone
I'm falling down the spiral destination unknown
Double crossed messenger all alone
Can't get no connection, can't get through
Where are you?
Well the night weighs heavy on his guilty mind
This far from the borderline
When the hitman comes
He knows damn well he has been cheated
And he says, "Help, I'm steppin' into the Twilight Zone
Place is a madhouse, feels like being cloned
My beacon's been moved under moon and star
Where am I to go now that I've gone too far?"
Help, I'm steppin' into the Twilight Zone
Place is a madhouse, feels like being cloned
My beacon's been moved under moon and star
Where am I to go now that I've gone too far?
Soon you will come to know
When the bullet hits the bone
Soon you will come to know
When the bullet hits the bone
When the bullet hits the bone
Help, I'm steppin' into the Twilight Zone
Place is a madhouse, feels like being cloned
My beacon's been moved under moon and star
Where am I to go now that I've gone too far?

I'm free, I'm free
And freedom tastes of reality
I'm free, I'm free
And I'm waiting for you to follow me

If I told you what it takes
To reach the highest high
You'd laugh and say nothing's that simple
But you've been told many times before
Messiahs pointed to the door
And no one had the guts to leave the temple!

I'm free, I'm free
And freedom tastes of reality
I'm free, I'm free
And I'm waiting for you to follow me

How can we follow?
How can we follow?



I said baby mama, I don't know your name
But I said baby, sugar I can play your game
Every night when we leave the hall
I see you hanging around
You wanna ride in my big black car baby
Want to go uptown

I know who you are baby
I know what they call you girl
Never put you down baby
I'm just like you baby, I'm on the hunt

I know lady
People going to talk about you and me
Let me say one thing mama, sugar I do as I please
And if you wanna love me baby, I'm your man
And all those high-faluting society people
I don't care if they don't understand


My daddy told me a long time ago
Said there's two things son
Two things you should know
And in these two things you must take pride
That's a horse and woman, yeah
Well both of them you ride



Oh, no one ever left alive In nineteen hundred and eighty five
Will ever do
She may be right, she may be fine
She may get love, but she won't get mine 'cause I got you
Oh, I
Oh, I
Well, I just can't get enough of that sweet stuff
My little lady gets behind

Shake it
Baby don't break it

Woo ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Woo ooh ooh

Oh, my mama said a time would come
When I would find myself in love with you
I didn't think, I never dreamed
That I would be around to see it all come true
Oh, I
Oh, I
Well, I just can't get enough of that sweet stuff
My little lady gets behind
Woo ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Woo ooh ooh

Oh, no one ever left alive in nineteen hundred and eighty five
Will ever do
Well, she may be right, she may be fine
She may get love, but she won't get mine
Because I got you
Oh, I
Oh, I
Well, I just can't get enough of that sweet stuff
My little lady left behind


Band on the run, band on the run
Band on the run, band on the run



Shapes of things before my eyes
Just teach me to despise
Will time make men more wise?

Here within my lonely frame
My eyes just hurt my brain
But will it seem the same?

Come tomorrow, will I be older?
Come tomorrow, may be a soldier
Come tomorrow, may I be bolder than today?

Now the trees are almost green
But will they still be seen?
When time and tide have been

Fall into your passing hands
Please don't destroy these lands
Don't make them desert sands

Come tomorrow, will I be older?
Come tomorrow, may be a soldier
Come tomorrow, may I be bolder than today?

Soon I hope that I will find
Thoughts deep within my mind
That won't disgrace my kind



I remember when rock was young
Me and Susie had so much fun
Holding hands and skimming stones
Had an old gold Chevy and a place of my own
But the biggest kick I ever got
Was doing a thing called the Crocodile Rock
While the other kids were rocking 'round the clock
We were hopping and bopping to the Crocodile Rock

Well, Crocodile Rocking is something shocking
When your feet just can't keep still
I never knew me a better time, and I guess I never will
Oh, lawdy mama, those Friday nights
When Susie wore her dresses tight
And the Crocodile Rocking was out of sight

Laa, la-la-la-la-laa
La-la-la-la-laa
La-la-la-la-laa

But the years went by and the rock just died
Susie went and left us for some foreign guy
Long nights crying by the record machine
Dreaming of my Chevy and my old blue jeans
But they'll never kill the thrills we've got
Burning up to the Crocodile Rock
Learning fast as the weeks went past
We really thought the Crocodile Rock would last
Well, Crocodile Rocking is something shocking
When your feet just can't keep still
I never knew me a better time, and I guess I never will
Oh, lawdy mama, those Friday nights
When Susie wore her dresses tight
And the Crocodile Rocking was out of sight

Laa, la-la-la-la-laa
La-la-la-la-laa
La-la-la-la-laa

'Cause I was born lonely down by the riverside
Learned to spin fortune wheels and throw dice
I was just thirteen when I had to leave home
Knew I couldn't stick around, I had to roam

Ain't good lookin', but you know I ain't shy
Ain't afraid to look you girl, hey, in the eye
So if you need some lovin', and you need it right away
Take a little time out, and maybe I'll stay

But I got to ramble (Ramblin' man)
Gamble (Gamblin' man)
Got to, got to ramble (ramblin' man)
I was born a ramblin', gamblin' man
Yeah, uhh, say, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, hah, hah

You can have your funky world, see you 'round
Cause I got to ramble (Ramblin' man)
I got to gamble (gamblin' man)
I got to ramble (ramblin' man)

Yeah! and I'm just a gambler
Come on and sing along
'Cause I'm just a rambler (ramblin' man)
Lord I'm a gambler (gamblin' man)
I'm a rambler (ramblin' man)



White bird in a golden cage
On a winter's day, in the rain
White bird in a golden cage
Alone

The leaves blow 'cross the long, black road
To the darkened sky in its rage
But the white bird just sits in her cage
Unknown

White bird must fly, she will die


The white bird dreams of the aspen tree
With her dying leaves turning gold
But the white bird just sits in her cage
Growing old

White bird must fly or she will die
White bird must fly or she will die
The sunsets come, the sunsets go
The clouds roll by, and the Earth turns slow
And a young bird's eyes do always glow
And she must fly
She must fly
She must fly


White bird in a golden cage
On a winter's day, in the rain
White bird in a golden cage
Alone

White bird must fly, she will die
White bird must fly or she will die
White bird must fly, she will die

White bird must fly



Sheepdog
Standing in the rain
Bullfrog
Doing it again
Some kind of happiness is measured out in miles
What makes you think you're something special when you smile?

Child-like
No one understands
Jack knife
In your sweaty hands
Some kind of innocence is measured out in years
You don't know what it's like to listen to your fears

You can talk to me
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
If you're lonely you can talk to me

Big man (Yeah)
Walking in the park
Wigwam
Frightened of the dark
Some kind of solitude is measured out in you
You think you know me but you haven't got a clue
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
If you're lonely you can talk to me

Wahoo woof! Woof!
Hey bulldog! Hey bulldog!
Hey bulldog! Hey bulldog!

Hey man, what's that boy?
Woof!
What do you say?
I said "woof!"
You know anymore?
Wooaah ha ha ha!
You've got it, that's it, you had it!
That's it, man, woo!
That's it! You've got it!
Don't look at me man, I only have ten children
Ah ho! Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Quiet boy, quiet!
Okay
Quiet!
Hey bulldog!
Hey bulldog!



I Dig a Pygmy by Charles Hawtrey and the Deaf Aids
Phase one, in which Doris gets her oats

Two of us riding nowhere, spending someone's
Hard earned pay
You and me Sunday driving, not arriving
On our way back home

We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

Two of us sending postcards, writing letters
On my wall
You and me burning matches, lifting latches
On our way back home

We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home
You and I have memories
Longer than the road that stretches out ahead

Two of us wearing raincoats, standing solo
In the sun
You and me chasing paper, getting nowhere
On our way back home

We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

You and I have memories
Longer than the road that stretches out ahead

Two of us wearing raincoats, standing solo
In the sun
You and me chasing paper, getting nowhere
On our way back home

We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home
We're going home
Better believe it
Goodbye



You're gonna miss me little baby, the day that I'm gone
You're gonna miss me little darlin', the day that I'm gone
'Cause I'm leavin' in the mornin', won't be back at all
You have run me ragged baby, it's your own fault, you're on your own
You have run me ragged darlin', it's your own fault, you're on your own
You didn't want me no way baby, till your other man was gone
You can try to get me back baby, with all your tricks and charms
You can try to get me back baby, with all your tricks and charms
But when all your games are over, you'll be left with empty arms
You have run me ragged baby, it's your own fault, you're on your own
You have run me ragged darlin', it's your own fault, you're on your own
You didn't want me no way baby, till your other man was gone
You can try to get me back baby, with all your tricks and charms
You can try to get me back baby, with all your tricks and charms
But when all your games are over, you'll be left with empty arms



Meanwhile back in the year one
When you belonged to no one
You didn't stand a chance, son
If your pants were undone
'Cause you were bred for humanity
And sold to society
One day you'll wake up in the present day
A million generations removed from expectations
Of being who you really want to be
Skating away, skating away, skating away
On the thin ice of the new day
So as you push off from the shore
Won't you turn your head once more
And make your peace with everyone
For those who choose to stay
Will live just one more day
To do the things they should've done
And as you cross the wilderness
Spinning in your emptiness
You feel you have to pray
Looking for a sign that the universal mind
Has written you into the passion play
Skating away, skating away, skating away
On the thin ice of the new day
And as you cross the circle line
Well, the ice wall creaks behind
You're a rabbit on the run
And the silver splinters fly
In the corner of your eye
Shining in the setting sun
Well, do you ever get the feeling
That the story's too damn real
And in the present tense?
Or that everybody's on the stage
And it seems like you're the only
Person sitting in the audience?
Skating away, skating away, skating away
On the thin ice of the new day
Skating away, skating away, skating away



Tough boys
Running the streets
Come a little closer
Rough toys
Under the sheets
Nobody knows her
Rough boys
Don't walk away
I very nearly missed you
Tough boys
Come over here
I wanna bite and kiss you
I wanna see what I can find
Tough kids
Take a bottle of wine
When your deal is broken
Ten quid
She's so easy to find
Not a word is spoken
Rough boys
Don't walk away
I feel pretty blissed here
Tough boy
I'm gonna carry you home
You got pretty pissed, dear
Gonna get inside you
Gonna get inside your bitter mind
I wanna see what I can find
Rough boys
Don't walk away
I wanna buy your leather
Make noise
Try and talk me away
We can't be seen together
Tough kids
What can I do?
I'm so pale and weedy
Rough fits
In my Hush Puppy shoes
But I'm still pleading
Pleading, bleeding, fining, whining, shining
I wanna see what I can find
Tough boys
Running the streets
Come a little closer
Rough toys
Under the sheets
Nobody knows her
Rough boys
Don't you walk away
I very nearly missed you
Tough boys
Come over here
I wanna bite and kiss you
I wanna see what I can find



When I get off of work on Friday after working like a dog all week
I go to meet the boys for a cold one at a little joint up the street
They got a jukebox in the corner full of old country tunes
Feed it five dollars worth of quarters is the first thing I always do

'Cause I need a little twang, a little hillbilly bending on some guitar strings
Some peddle steel whining like a whistle of an old freight train
To get that foot stomping honky tonking feeling going through my veins
I need a little twang, twang, twang

Well, I like a lot of kinds of music, I try to keep an open mind
Depending on the mood to strike me if I'm gonna stay till closing time
So when I wanna lift my spirits to get me feeling worth a dang
I know I'm gonna have to hear it 'cause I gotta have some Hank to hang

'Cause I need a little twang, a little hillbilly bending on some guitar strings
Some peddle steel whining like a whistle of an old freight train
To get that foot stomping honky tonking feeling going through my veins
I need a little twang, twang, twang

'Cause I need a little twang, a little hillbilly bending on some guitar strings
Some peddle steel whining like a whistle of an old freight train
To get that foot stomping honky tonking feeling going through my veins
I need a little twang, twang, twang



People of the Earth can you hear me?
Came a voice from the sky on that magical night
And in the colors of a thousand sunsets
They traveled through the world on a silvery light
The people of the Earth stood waiting
Watching as the ships came one by one
Setting fire to the sky as they landed
Carrying to the world Children Of The Sun
Children of the sun
All at once came a sound from the inside
Then a beam made of light hit the ground
Everyone felt the sound of their heartbeat
Every Man - Every Woman - Every Child
They passed the limits of imagination
Through the doors - to a world - of another time
On the journey of a thousand lifetimes
With the Children Of The Sun - They started to climb
Children of the sun, children of the sun
No more gravity, nothing holding them down
Floating endlessly, as their ship leaves the ground
Thru the walls of time - at the speed of light
Fly the crystal ships on their celestial flight
On their celestial flight
Children of the sun, children of the sun
Children of the sun
Children of the sun, children of the sun
Children of the sun, children of the sun
Children of the sun, children of the sun
Children of the sun, children of the sun
Children of the sun, children of the sun
Children of the sun, children of the sun



Got those highway blues, can't you hear my motor runnin'
Flyin' down the road with my foot on the floor
All the way in town they can hear me comin'
Ford's about to drop, she won't do no more
And I smell my motor burnin'
Underneath the hood is smoke
Can't stop, and I can't stop
Got to keep on movin' or I'll lose my mind

Oh, rockin' down the highway
Oh, rockin' down the highway
Oh, rockin' down the highway
Oh, rockin' down the highway

The highway patrol got his eyes on me
I know what he's thinkin' and it ain't good
I'm movin' so fast he can barely see me
Gonna lose that man, I know I should
I gotta kick in my pedal
Make my Ford move a little bit faster
Can't stop, and I can't stop
Got to keep movin' or I'll lose my mind
Oh, rockin' down the highway
Oh, rockin' down the highway
Oh, rockin' down the highway
Oh, rockin' down the highway


Oh, rockin' down the highway
Oh, rockin' down the highway
Oh, rockin' down the highway
Oh, rockin' down the highway



Seems I've got to have a change of scene
'Cause every night I have the strangest dreams
Imprisoned by the way it could have been
Left here on my own or so it seems
I've got to leave before I start to scream
But someone's locked the door and took the key

You feeling all right?
I'm not feelin' too good myself
Well, you feeling all right?
I'm not feeling too good myself

Well, boy, you sure took me for one big ride
And even now I sit and wonder why
And when I think of you I start to cry
I just can't waste my time, I must keep dry
Got to stop believing in all your lies
'Cause there's too much to do before I die

You feeling all right?
I'm not feelin' too good myself
Well, you feeling all right?
I'm not feeling too good myself
Wait for me, yeah

All right, yeah

Don't get too lost in all I say
Though at the time I really felt that way
But that was then, now it's today
I can't get off yet and so I'm here to stay
Till someone comes along and takes my place
With a different name and, yes, a different face

You feeling all right?
I'm not feelin' too good myself
Well, you feeling all right?
I'm not feeling too good myself
(Alright) You feeling all right?
I'm not feelin' too good myself
Well, you feeling all right?
I'm not feeling too good myself
You feeling all right?
I'm not feelin' too good myself



I hear the ticking of the clock
I'm lying here the room's pitch dark
I wonder where you are tonight
No answer on the telephone
And the night goes by so very slow
Oh, I hope that it won't end though
Alone

'Till now I always got by on my own
I never really cared until I met you
And now it chills me to the bone
How do I get you alone?
How do I get you alone?

You don't know how long I have wanted
To touch your lips and hold you tight, oh
You don't know how long I have waited
And I was gonna tell you tonight
But the secret is still my own
And my love for you is still unknown
Alone

'Till now I always got by on my own
I never really cared until I met you
And now it chills me to the bone
How do I get you alone?
How do I get you alone?

How do I get you alone?
How do I get you alone?
Alone, alone



You say that it's over baby, Lord
You say that it's over now
But still you hang around me, come on
Won't you move over
You know that I need a man, honey Lord
You know that I need a man
But when I ask you to you just tell me
That maybe you can
Please don't you do it to me babe, no!
Please don't you do it to me baby
Either take this love I offer
Or honey let me be
I'm not quite ready for walking, no no no no
I'm not quite ready for walking
And what are you going to do with your life
Life all just dangling?
Oh yeah, make up your mind, honey
You're playing with me, hey hey hey
Make up your mind, darling
You're playing with me, come on now!
Now either be my loving man
I said let me honey, let me be, yeah!
You say that it's over baby, Lord
You say that it's over now
But still you hang around me, come on
Won't you move over
You know that I need a man, honey Lord
You know that I need a man
But when I ask you to you just tell me
That maybe you can
Please don't you do it to me babe, no!
Please don't you do it to me baby
Either take this love I offer
Or honey let me be
I said won't you, won't you let me be?
Honey, you're teasing me
Yeah, you're playing with my heart, dear
I believe you're toying with my affections, honey
I can't take it no more baby
And furthermore, I don't intend to
I'm just tired of hanging from the end of a string, honey
You expect me to fight like a goddamned mule
Wah, wah, wah, wah, honey

Sail right around all the seven oceans
Drop it straight into the deep blue sea

Helplessly hoping
Her harlequin hovers nearby
Awaiting a word
Gasping at glimpses
Of gentle true spirit
He runs, wishing he could fly
Only to trip at the sound of good-bye

Wordlessly watching
He waits by the window
And wonders
At the empty place inside
Heartlessly helping himself to her bad dreams
He worries
Did he hear a good-bye? Or even hello?

They are one person
They are two alone
They are three together
They are for each other

Stand by the stairway
You'll see something
Certain to tell you confusion has its cost
Love isn't lying
It's loose in a lady who lingers
Saying she is lost
And choking on hello
They are one person
They are two alone
They are three together
They are for each other



Get Off My Cloud
Written by Latour,  Joey Spatafora,   Bolander Davis,  Dave Hunt,  Emery Joe Yost
Performed by The Squids
Don't tell me to turn my stereo down
When you hear my music on
You should be dancing
And be real happy that you live next door to a guy
Who likes to hear really good music
Like The Rolling Stones and "103.5 The Blaze"
Get off my cloud
Cause if you hear me rockin'
Don't bother knockin'
Don't tell me to turn my "Walkman" down
There's no way that you could possibly hear the music
These are small little headphones that bother no one
These are small little headphones
Get off my cloud
Cause if you hear me rockin'
Don't bother knockin'
Cause I'm rockin' baby
Cut



Well everytime that I come home nobody wants to let me be
It seems that all the friends I've got just got to come interrogate me
Well, I appreciate your feelings and I don't want to pass you by
But I don't ask you about your business, don't ask me about mine

Well its true I love the money and I love my brand new car
I like drinking the best of whiskey and playing in a honky tonk bar
But when I come off the road, well I just got to have my time
'Cause I got to find a break in this action, else I'm going to lose my mind

So don't ask me no questions
And I won't tell you no lies
So don't ask me about my business
And I won't tell you goodbye, that's right

Well, "What's your favorite color?" and "Do you dig the Brothers?" is driving me up a wall
And every time I think I can sleep, some fool has got to call
Well don't you think that when I come home, I just want a little peace of mind
If you want to talk about the business buddy, you're just wasting time

So don't ask me no questions
And I won't tell you no lies
So don't ask me about my business
And I won't tell you goodbye
I said don't ask no stupid questions
And I won't send you away
If you want to talk fishing
Well I guess that'll be okay



(One, two, three, four)

I went home with the waitress
The way I always do
How was I to know
She was with the Russians too?

I was gambling in Havana
I took a little risk
Send lawyers, guns, and money
Dad, get me out of this
Ha!

I'm the innocent bystander
And somehow I got stuck
Between the rock and the hard place
And I'm down on my luck
Yes, I'm down on my luck
Well, I'm down on my luck

Now I'm hiding in Honduras
I'm a desperate man
Send lawyers, guns, and money
The shit has hit the fan
Alright, send lawyers, guns, and money
Huh, yeah
Send lawyers, guns, and money
Uh
Send lawyers, guns, and money
Hey
Send lawyers, guns, and money
Ooh, yeah
Yeah
Yeah



There’s colors on the street
Red, white, and blue
People shuffling their feet
People sleeping in their shoes
There’s a warning sign on the road ahead
There’s a lot of people saying we’d be better off dead
Don’t feel like Satan, but I am to them
So I try to forget it any way I can
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
I see a woman in the night
With a baby in her hand
There's an old street light
Near a garbage can
Now she put the kid away and she’s gone to get a hit
She hates her life and what she’s done to it
There’s one more kid that’ll never go to school
Never get to fall in love, never get to be cool
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
We got a thousand points of light
For the homeless man
We got a kinder, gentler machine gun hand
We've got department stores and toilet paper
Got Styrofoam boxes for the ozone layer
Got a man of the people says keep hope alive
Got fuel to burn, got roads to drive
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world



She's really upset with me again
I didn't give her what she likes
I don't know what to tell her
Don't know what to say
Everything got funky last night

She was really bombed
And I was really blown away
And when I asked her what she wanted
And this is what she had to say
A pearl necklace
She want a pearl necklace
She want a pearl necklace
She gets a charge out of being so weird
Digs getting downright strange
But I can keep a handle on anything
Just this side of deranged

She was gettin' bombed
And I was gettin' blown away
And she knew it in her head
And this is what she had to say
A pearl necklace
She want a pearl necklace
She want a pearl necklace
She want a pearl necklace

She is so tough
And pure as the driven slush
And that's not jewelry she's talking 'bout
It really don't cost that much
She was gettin' bombed
And I was gettin' blown away
And she knew it in her head
And this is what she had to say
A pearl necklace
She want a pearl necklace
She want a pearl necklace
She want a pearl necklace



You're lazy, you just stay in bed
You're lazy just stay in bed
You don't want no money, you don't want no bread
If you're drowning, you don't clutch no straw
If you're drowning, you don't clutch no straw
You don't want to live, don't want to cry no more


Well, my crying ain't done no good
I said, my trying ain't done no good
You don't make no effort, no, not like you should

Lazy!
You just stay in bed
Lazy!
You just stay in bed
You don't want no money, you don't want no bread



Oh! Darling, please believe me
I'll never do you no harm
Believe me when I tell you
I'll never do you no harm

Oh! Darling, if you leave me
I'll never make it alone
Believe me when I beg you (Wooo!)
Don't ever leave me alone

When you told me, you didn't need me anymore
Well, you know I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me, that you didn't need me anymore
Well, you know I nearly fell down and died

Oh! Darling, if you leave me
I'll never make it alone
Believe me when I tell you
I'll never do you no harm
(Believe me, darling!)

When you told me (Woo!) you didn't need me anymore
Well, you know I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me you didn't need me anymore
Well, you know I nearly fell down and died
Oh! Darling, please believe me
I'll never let you down
(Oh! Believe me, darling)
Believe me when I tell you
I'll never do you no harm



Stepping like a concrete mixer
All these odd thoughts flicker
While these soft parts flutter
Churning all that glitter ain't gold
By the digits or they got 'em in the gutter
You can find it where the road hits the rubber stamp
Ode to the underbelly
Fold with the upper-hand? Please
I tell myself "breathe"
I tell you "pardon my reach"
I thread the needle through the heart of the dream
To see which part of it bleeds

Yeah
Doin' donuts in an Acura in slow motion
Cause life is cooler than you thought it was
Doors open, both hands up, eyes closed
Taking out a stop light, that's my real life
Push buttons and write words and say em for work
And make nerds feel something as fuck daily
Guaranteed stressed out with a dumb heart
And a V Chill Vibe but throw a TV at you crazy
Bitches say "P, you crazy"
Then they get pissed that I said the word "bitches"
Then I explain that I was quoting a rap guy
And that's how my rap dies
I laugh then laugh-cry
I was diggin' for a fire while you were gone fishin', reeling
I was key in the ignition, peelin'
Listen to the tires squealin'
Feelin' inspired in spite o' all these flashin' red lights
I was maskin' my pain but I was feelin' all right
You were passin' that blame
While I was passin' that light
I was takin' that light, tryna feel a little better
I was takin' that light, makin' somethin' insane
I would make it galvanize
Put the metal to the flame
Eyes, heavy 90's metal bass player vibe
Slowly cockin' his head to one side
Creep City like I'm Cedar Falls, Iowa, and that's fine
I get a "fuck yes" out of a "maybe"
Make it wavy like whoa
Surf's up somethin' crazy
Do's what I feel like, that's my real life



How are the tenders, Johnny?

Why don't you ask him if he's going to stay?
Why don't you ask him if he's going away?
Why don't you tell me what's going on?
Why don't you tell me who's on the phone?
Why don't you ask him what's going wrong?
Why don't you ask him who's the latest on his throne?
(Ooga-aga-ooga)

Don't say that you love me (Hiyee)
Just tell me that you want me (Hiyee)
Tusk!
Just say that you want me (Hiyee)
Don't tell me that you--

Tusk!
(Real savage-like)
Tusk!
Tusk!
Tusk! Tusk! Tusk!



Take the highway
Lord knows I've been gone too long
Lot of sad days
One day you'll turn around and I'll be gone
And the time has finally come
For me to pack my bags and walk away
Hear me say

I'll be back someday
But darlin' please don't wait for me too long
There's just one place I can't stay
Memories of your love still lingers on
And the time has finally come
For me to pack my bags and walk away
Hear me say


I'll be back someday
But darlin' please don't wait for me too long
There's just one place I can't stay
Memories of your love still lingers on
And the time has finally come
For me to pack my bags and walk away
Hear me say
Take the highway
Take the highway
Take the highway
And the time has finally come
For me to pack my bags and walk away
Here me say



No one told me about her
The way she lied
Well, no one told me about her
How many people cried
Well, it's too late to say you're sorry
How would I know, why should I care
Please don't bother trying to find her
She's not there...oh oh oh
Nobody told me about her
What could I do
Well, nobody told me about her
Though they all knew
Well, it's too late to say you're sorry
How would I know, why should I care
Please don't bother trying to find her
She's not there....
Well, let me tell you about the way she looked
The way she acted, the color of her hair
Her voice is soft and cool
Her eyes are clear and bright
But she's not there...
Well it's too later to say you're sorry
How would I know, why should I care
Please don't bother trying to find her
She's not there...
Well, let me tell you about the way she looked
The way she acted, the color of her hair
Her voice is soft and cool
Her eyes are clear and bright
But she's not there...



Why's it never light on my lawn?
Why does it rain and never say, "Good day" to the newborn?
On the big screen, they showed us a sun
But not as bright in life as the real one
It's never quite the same as the real one

And tell me, grey seal
How does it feel to be so wise?
To see through eyes that only see what's real
Tell me, grey seal

I never learned why meteors were formed
I only farmed in schools that were so worn and torn
If anyone can cry, then so can I
I read books and draw life from the eye
All my life is drawings from the eye

And tell me, grey seal
How does it feel to be so wise?
To see through eyes that only see what's real
Tell me, grey seal
Your mission bells were wrought by ancient men
The roots were formed by twisted roots
Your roots were twisted then
I was reborn before all life could die
The phoenix bird will leave this world to fly
If the phoenix bird can fly, then so can I

And tell me, grey seal
How does it feel to be so wise?
To see through eyes that only see what's real
Tell me, grey seal



Rudy's on a train to nowhere;
Halfway down the line
He don't wanna get there
But he needs time
He ain't sophisticated
Or well-educated
After all the hours he wasted-
Still he needs time
He needs time
He needs time for livin'
He needs time-
For someone just to see him
He ain't had no lovin'
For no reason or rhyme
And the whole world's above him
Well, it's not as though he's fat
Nah, there's more to it than that
See he tried to play it cool;
Wouldn't be nobody's fool
Rudy thought
That all good things
Comes to those that wait
But recently
He could see
That it may come but too late
All through your life
All through the years
Nobody loved
Nobody cared
So dim the light
Dark are your fears
Try as I might
I can't hold back the tears
How can you live?
Without love, it's not fair
Someone said give
But I just didn't dare
What good advice
Are you waiting to hear?
Hearing's alright
For them that's all there
Hearing's alright

You'd better-
You'd better gain control now
You'd better show'em all now
You'd better make or break now
You'd better give and take now
You'll have to push and shove now
You'll have to find some love now
You'd better gain control now
Now he's just come out the movie-
Numb of all the pain
Sad, but in a while he'll soon be
Back on his train

The song is over
It's all behind me
I should have known it
She tried to find me

Our love is over
They're all ahead now
I've got to learn it
I'm gonna sing out

I'll sing my song to the wide open spaces
I'll sing my heart out to the infinite sea
I'll sing my visions to the sky high mountains
I'll sing my song to the free, to the free
I'll sing my song to the wide open spaces
I'll sing my heart out to the infinite sea
I'll sing my visions to the sky high mountains
I'll sing my song to the free, to the free
{Guitar solo}

When I walked in through the door
Thought it was me I was looking for
She was the first song I ever sang
But it stopped as soon as it began
Our love is over
It's all behind me
They're all ahead now
Can't hope to find me

I'll sing my song to the wide open spaces
I'll sing my heart out to the infinite sea
I'll sing my visions to the sky high mountains
I'll sing my song to the free, to the free
I'll sing my song to the wide open spaces
I'll sing my heart out to the infinite sea
I'll sing my visions to the sky high mountains
I'll sing my song to the free, to the free
{Instrumental}

The song is over
I'm left with only tears
I must remember
Even if it takes a million years

The song is over
The song is over
Excepting one note, pure and easy
Playing so free, like a breath rippling by



Heartbreaker... Soulshaker!
I've been told about you...
Steamroller, Midnight Shoulder...
What they've been sayin must be true...
Red Hot Mama
Velvet Charmer
'Times come to pay your dues...

Now you're messin' with...
A son of bitch!
(Now You're messin' with a son of bitch)

Talkin' jivey poison ivy...
You ain't gonna cling to me...
Mantaker...Born Faker...
I ain't so blind I can't see...
Red Hot Mama
Velvet Charmer
The time's come to pay your dues...



Hey you
Out there in the cold, getting lonely, getting old
Can you feel me?
Hey you
Standing in the aisles with itchy feet and fading smiles
Can you feel me?
Hey you
Don't help them to bury the light
Don't give in without a fight

Hey you
Out there on your own, sitting naked by the phone
Would you touch me?
Hey you
With your ear against the wall, waiting for someone to call out
Could you touch me?
Hey you
Would you help me to carry the stone?
Open your heart, I'm coming home

But it was only fantasy
The wall was too high, as you can see
No matter how he tried, he could not break free
And the worms ate into his brain

Hey you
Out there on the road, always doing what you're told
Can you help me?
Hey you
Out there beyond the wall, breaking bottles in the hall
Can you help me?
Hey you
Don't tell me there's no hope at all
Together we stand, divided we fall

(We fall, we fall, we fall, we fall, we fall, we fall, we fall, we fall...)



On the first part of the journey
I was looking at all the life
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
There was sand and hills and rings
The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz
And the sky with no clouds
The heat was hot and the ground was dry
But the air was full of sound

I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can remember your name
'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain
La, la, la lala la la la, la, la
La, la, la lala la la la, la, la

After two days in the desert sun
My skin began to turn red
After three days in the desert fun
I was looking at a river bed
And the story it told of a river that flowed
Made me sad to think it was dead
You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can remember your name
Because there ain't no one for to give you no pain
La, la, la lala la la la, la, la
La, la, la lala la la la, la, la


After nine days I let the horse run free
'Cause the desert had turned to sea
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
There was sand and hills and rings
The ocean is a desert with its life underground
And a perfect disguise above
Under the cities lies a heart made of ground
But the humans will give no love

You see, I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can remember your name
'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain
La, la, la lala la la la, la, la
La, la, la lala la la la, la, la
La, la, la lala la la la, la, la
La, la, la lala la la la, la, la
La, la, la lala la la la, la, la
La, la, la lala la la la, la, la
La, la, la lala la la la, la, la
La, la, la lala la la la, la, la



Ooh

Lighten up, baby, I'm in love with you

Don't let me down, don't let me down
Don't let me down, don't let me down

Nobody ever loved me like she does
Oh, she does
Yeah, she does
And if somebody loved me like she do me
Oh, she do me
Yes, she does

Don't let me down, don't let me down
Don't let me down, don't let me down

I'm in love for the first time
Don't you know it's gonna last
It's a love that lasts forever
It's a love that has no past (Seeking past)
Don't let me down, don't let me down
Don't let me down, don't let me down
And from the first time that she really done me
Oh, she done me
She done me good
I guess nobody ever really done me
Oh, she done me
She done me good

Don't let me down, don't let me down
Don't let me down, don't let me down

Don't let me down
Don't let me down, don't let me let down
Can you dig it? Don't let me down



No wind when I took the watch
My ship was still and waiting
I lay on that mirrored sky
A restless sailor waiting
I closed my eyes said the
Words of will for the gentle
Breathing that moves the seas
Make my sails fill
Whisper waves cloud the glass
Awake at last like a lover
It rushed around me talking sweet
Roll over, roll over, roll over
And in my ear he blew his name
It sound so strange but I heard it plain
Mistral, mistral wind
I have always held the wheel but
I let the wind steal my power
Spin me 'round lose my course
Nights run by like hours
Well, it would show me the way
To the deepest mountains
Too high and beautiful to be
Mistral, mistral wind
All the hours on the watch
I wait for that breeze to move me
And blow me back to that place
Magic space all through me
And I sigh your name
Across the empty water
You made a crazy dreamer out of me
Mistral, mistral, mistral, mistral
Mistral, mistral



I know you broke up with him
And your heart's still on the shelf
It's been over two years for me
And I'm still not quite myself
You can't be with someone new
And you can't go back to him
You're beginning to realize
That it's sink or swim
I see you around sometimes
And my heart just melts
You're lookin' like if you had your wish
You'd be somewhere else
And it just breaks my heart
To see you here this way
Someday I'll get the nerve
To walk up to you and say

This is the last worthless evening
That you'll have to spend
Just gimme a chance
To show you how to love again
This is the last worthless evening
That you'll have to spend
Cause I'll be there
When your broken heart is on the mend
Every night it's the same old crowd in smoky rooms
You catch a faint glimpse of love sometimes
But it never blooms
I've been around this block a time or two
And I've made some big mistakes
But girl I promise you, I promise you

This is the last worthless evening
That you'll have to spend
Just gimme a chance
To show you how to love again
This is the last worthless evening
That you'll have to spend
Cause it won't be long
Til your little heart is on the mend

(time, time, tickin, tickin, tickin away)
(time, time, tickin, tickin, tickin)
(time, time, tickin, tickin, tickin away)
(time, time, tickin, tickin, tickin)

People inside their houses
With the shades pulled down
God knows we could use some romance
In this sleepy bedroom town
I know you're still afraid to rush into anything
But there are just so many summers, babe
And just so many springs
And this is the last worthless evening
That you'll have to spend, baby
Just gimme a chance, gimme a chance
To show you love again
This is the last worthless evening
That you'll have to spend
Cause it won't be long
Til your little heart is on the mend
That you'll have to spend
Just gimme a chance, darlin
To show you how to love again
This is the last worthless evening
That you'll have to spend 'cause it won't be long
Til your little heart is on the mend



I ain't got nobody that I can depend on
I ain't got nobody that I can depend on
I ain't got nobody that I can depend on
I ain't got nobody that I can depend on
I ain't got no one (no tengo a nadie)
That I know of (no tengo a nadie)
That I can depend on (no tengo a nadie)
I ain't got no one (no tengo a nadie)
That I know of (no tengo a nadie)
That I can depend on (no tengo a nadie)

Sunshine came softly through my a-window today
Could've tripped out easy a-but I've a-changed my ways
It'll take time, I know it but in a while
You're gonna be mine, I know it, we'll do it in style
Cause I made my mind up you're going to be mine
I'll tell you right now
Any trick in the book now, baby, all that I can find
Everybody's hustlin' just to have a little scene
When I say we'll be cool I think that you know what I mean
We stood on a beach at sunset, do you remember when?
I know a beach where, baby, a-it never ends
When you've made your mind up forever to be mine
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm
I'll pick up your hand and slowly blow your little mind
Cause I made my mind up you're going to be mine
I'll tell you right now
Any trick in the book now, baby, all that I can find
Superman or Green Lantern ain't got a-nothin' on me
I can make like a turtle and dive for your pearls in the sea, yeah!
A you-you-you can just sit there a-thinking on your velvet throne
'bout all the rainbows a-you can a-have for your own
When you've made your mind up forever to be mine
I'll pick up your hand and slowly blow your little mind
When you've made your mind up forever to be mine
I'll pick up your hand
I'll pick up your hand



Said farewell to my last hotel, it never was much kind of abode
Glasgow town never brought me down when I was heading out on the road
Carlisle city never looked so pretty, and the Kendal freeway is fast
Slow down driver, wanna stay alive, I wanna make this journey last

Helen (Helen)
Hell on wheels
Ain't nobody else gonna know the way she feels
Helen (Helen)
Hell on wheels
And they're never gonna take her away

M6 south down Liverpool, where they play the west coast sound
Sailor Sam, he came from Birmingham, but he never will be found
Doin' fine when a London sign greets me like a long lost friend
Mister motor won't you check her out, she's gotta take me back again

Helen (Helen)
Hell on wheels
Ain't nobody else gonna know the way she feels
Helen (Helen)
Hell on wheels
And they're never gonna take her away
Got no time for a rum and lime, I wanna get my right foot down
Shake some dust off of this old bus, I gotta get her out of town
Spend the day upon the motorway, where the carburetors blast
Slow down driver, wanna stay alive, I wanna make this journey last

Helen (Helen)
Hell on wheels
Ain't nobody else gonna know the way she feels
Helen (Helen)
Hell on wheels
And they're never gonna take her away

Say bye-bye!
Bye-bye!



{Intro}
Been forty days since I don't know when
I just saw her with my best friend
Do you know what I mean?
Do you know, know what I mean?
I just saw her yesterday
I just saw her, asked her to stay
Do you know what I mean?
Lord, Do you know what I mean?
Her and Bobby were steppin' out
Her and Bobby didn't know I found out
Do you know what I mean?
Do you know, know what I mean?
So I asked her if she still cared
She didn't hear me, she just stared
Do you know what I mean?
Lord, Do you know what I mean?
And then she said
Lee you haven't loved me in nearly four years
You haven't noticed that I held back my tears
And now you have, but it's really too late
Better find yourself another girl
Better find another girl
Better find uh, another place
{Pause}
She just left me yesterday
She just left me, had nothing to say
Do you know what I mean?
Oh, do you know what I mean?
She's a dandy, yes indeed
She's a dandy, but now she's free
Do you know what I mean?
Lord, do you know what I mean? Yeah
Been forty days since I don't know when
I just saw her with my best friend
Do you know what I mean?
Lord, do you know what I mean?
I just saw her yesterday
I just saw her, learn how to stay
Do you know what I mean?
Lord, Do you know what I mean?
Yeah, here comes it now..

I never knew, never knew how complete love could be
Till she kissed me and said:

"Baby, please, go all the way
It feels so right being with you, here, tonight
Please, go all the way
Just hold 'me close don't ever let me go"

I couldn't say what I wanted to say
Till she whispered:
"I love you so"

"Please, go all the way
It feels so right being with you, here, tonight
Please go all the way
Just hold me close, don't ever let me go"
Before her love I was cruel and mean
I had a hole in the place where my heart should have been
But now I've changed and it feels so strange
I come alive when she does all those things to me
And she says:
"Come on, come on, come on
I need you, I love you, I need you"

"Baby, please, go all the way
It feels so right being with you, here, tonight
Please, go all the way
Just hold me close don't ever let me go"

Oh no
Uuuh, uuh, uuhh
Oh no
No, no, no, nah, nah
Go all the way, baby
Woo-hoo-ooo!



I was driving home early Sunday morning through Bakersfield
Listening to gospel music on the colored radio station
And the preacher said, "You know, you always have the
Lord by your side"
And I was so pleased to be informed of this
That I ran twenty red lights in his honor
Thank you Jesus, thank you Lord
I had an arrangement to meet a girl, and I was kind of late
And I thought by the time I got there she'd be be off
She'd be off with the nearest truck driver she could find
Much to my surprise, there she was sitting in the corner
A little bleary, worse for wear and tear
Was a girl with far away eyes
But I'll tell you

So if you're down on your luck
And you can't harmonize
Find a girl with far away eyes
And if you're downright disgusted
And life ain't worth a dime
Get a girl with far away eyes
Well

Well the preacher kept right on saying that all I had to do was send
Ten dollars to the Church of the Sacred Bleeding Heart of Jesus
Located somewhere in Los Angeles, California
And next week they'd say my prayer on the radio
And all my dreams would come true
So I did, the next week, I got a prayer for the girl
Well, you know what kind of eyes she got
But I'll tell you

So if you're down on your luck
I know you all sympathize
Find a girl with far away eyes
And if you're downright disgusted
And life ain't worth a dime
Get a girl with far away eyes
So if you're down on your luck
I know you all sympathize
Get a girl with far away eyes



I remember standing on the corner at midnight
Trying to get my courage up
There was this long lovely dancer in a little club downtown
I loved to watch her do her stuff
Through the long lonely nights, she filled my sleep
Her body softly swaying to that smoky beat
Down on mainstreet
Down on mainstreet

In the pool halls, the hustlers and the losers
I used to watch 'em through the glass
Well I'd stand outside at closing time
Just to watch her walk on past
Unlike all the other ladies, she looked so young and sweet
As she made her way alone down that empty street
Down on mainstreet
Down on mainstreet

And sometimes even now, when I'm feeling lonely and beat
I drift back in time and I find my feet
Down on mainstreet
Down on mainstreet



{Intro}
And if she should tell you "come closer"
And if she tempts you with her charms
Tell her no no no no no-no-no-no
No no no no no-no-no-no
No no no no no
Don't hurt me now for her love belongs to me
And if she should tell you "I love you" (whoa)
And if she tempts you with her charms
Tell her no no no no no-no-no-no
No no no no no-no-no-no
(Don't let her down from your arms)
No no no no no (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Don't hurt me now for her love belongs to me
I know she's the kind of girl
Who'd throw my love away
But I still love her so
Don't hurt me now, don't hurt me now
If she tells you "I love you"
Just remember she said that to me
Tell her no no no no no-no-no-no (oh yeah)
No no no no no-no-no-no
(Don't take her love from my arms)
No no no no no
Don't leave me now for her love belongs to me
{Outro}



It don't come easy
You know it don't come easy
It don't come easy
You know it don't come easy

Got to pay your dues if you wanna sing the blues
And you know it don't come easy
You don't have to shout or leap about
You can even play them easy

Forget about the past and all your sorrows
The future won't last
It will soon be over tomorrow

I don't ask for much, I only want trust
And you know it don't come easy
And this love of mine keeps growing all the time
And you know it just ain't easy

Open up your heart, let's come together
Use a little love
And we will make it work out better
Got to pay your dues if you wanna sing the blues
And you know it don't come easy
You don't have to shout or leap about
You can even play them easy

Peace, remember peace is how we make it
Here within your reach
If you're big enough to take it

I don't ask for much, I only want trust
And you know it don't come easy
And this love of mine keeps growing all the time
And you know it don't come easy



I used to be such a sweet, sweet thing
'Til they got a hold of me
I opened doors for little old ladies
I helped the blind to see

I got no friends cause they read the papers
They can't be seen with me
And I'm gettin' real shot down
And I'm feeling mean
No more Mister Nice Guy
No more Mister Clean
No more Mister Nice Guy
They say he's sick, he's obscene
I got no friends cause they read the papers
They can't be seen with me
And I'm feelin' real shot down
And I'm, I'm gettin' mean
No more Mister Nice Guy
No more Mister Clean
No more Mister Nice Guy
They say he's sick, he's obscene
My dog bit me on the leg today
My cat clawed my eyes (Nice guy)
Ma's been thrown out of the social circle
And dad has to hide
I went to church incognito
When everybody rose, the Reverend Smith
He, he recognized me
And punched me in the nose, he said

No more Mister Nice Guy
No more Mister Clean
No more Mister Nice Guy
He said you're sick, you're obscene
No more Mister Nice Guy
No more Mister Clean
No more Mister Nice Guy
He said you're sick, you're obscene



You go to Las Wages
Las Wages
You go to Las Wages
While the poor people sleepin'
With the shade on the light
While the poor people sleepin'
All the stars come out at night
While the poor people sleepin'
With the shade on the light
While the poor people sleepin'
All the stars come out at night
After closing time
At the Guernsey fair
I detect the El Supremo
From the room at the top of the stairs
Well I've been around the world
And I've been in the Washington zoo
And in all my travels
As the facts unravel
I've found this to be true
While the poor people sleepin'
With the shade on the light
While the poor people sleepin'
All the stars come out at night
While the poor people sleepin'
With the shade on the light
While the poor people sleepin'
All the stars come out at night
They got the house on the corner
With the rug inside
They got the booze they need
All that money can buy
They got the shapely bodies
They got the Steely Dan T-shirt
And for the Coup de grâce
They're outrageous
Oh, honey let me tell you

While the poor people sleepin'
With the shade on the light
While the poor people sleepin'
All the stars come out at night
While the poor people sleepin'
With the shade on the light
While the poor people sleepin'
All the stars come out at night

Show business kids making movies
Of themselves you know they
Don't give a fuck about anybody else
You know you gonna

While the poor people sleepin'
With the shade on the light
While the poor people sleepin'
With the shade on the light
While the poor people sleepin'
All the stars come out at night
While the poor people sleepin'
With the shade on the light
While the poor people sleepin'
All the stars come out at night



Got a feeling inside (Can't explain)
It's a certain kind (Can't explain)
I feel hot and cold (Can't explain)
Yeah, down in my soul, yeah (Can't explain)
I said ... (Can't explain)
I'm feeling good now, yeah, but (Can't explain)
Dizzy in the head and I'm feeling blue
The things you've said, well, maybe they're true
I'm gettin' funny dreams again and again
I know what it means, but …

Can't explain
I think it's love
Try to say it to you
When I feel blue

But I can't explain (Can't explain)
Yeah, hear what I'm saying, girl (Can't explain)

Dizzy in the head and I'm feeling bad
The things you've said have got me real mad
I'm gettin' funny dreams again and again
I know what it means but

But I can't explain (Can't explain)
Forgive me one more time, now (Can't explain)

I said I can't explain, yeah
You drive me out of my mind
Yeah, I'm the worrying kind, babe
I said I can't explain



I'm not content to be with you in the daytime
Girl, I want to be with you all of the time

The only time I feel all right is by your side
Girl, I want to be with you all of the time
All day and all of the night
All day and all of the night
All day and all of the night

I believe that you and me last forever
Oh yeah, all day and nighttime yours, leave me never

The only time I feel alright is by your side
Girl, I want to be with you all of the time
All day and all of the night
All day and all of the night
Oh, come on


I believe that you and me last forever
Oh yeah, all day and nighttime yours, leave me never
The only time I feel alright is by your side
Girl, I want to be with you all of the time
All day and all of the night
All day and all of the night-time
All day and all of the night



Turn off your mind, relax and float downstream
It is not dying, it is not dying

Lay down all thoughts, surrender to the void
It is shining, it is shining

That you may see the meaning of within
It is being, it is being

That love is all and love is everyone
It is knowing, it is knowing

That ignorance and hate may mourn the dead
It is believing, it is believing

But listen to the colour of your dreams
It is not living, it is not living
Or play the game "Existence" to the end
Of the beginning, of the beginning

Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning



Runnin' through this business of life
Raisin' sand if I'm needed to
Ain't so funny when things ain't feelin' right
Daddy's hand helps to see me through
Sweet as sugar, love won't wash away
Rain or shine, it's always here to stay
All these years you and I spent together
All this, we just, couldn't stand the weather

Like a train that stops at every station
We all deal with trials and tribulations
Fear hangs the fellow that ties up his years
Entangled in yellow and cries all his tears
Changes come before we can grow
Learn to see them before we're too old
Don't just take me for tryin' to be heavy
Understand, it's time to get ready for the storm



Every night I have the same old dream
'Bout you and me and what's in between
So many changes, so many lies
Try to run, try to hide
From everything that I feel inside
But I can't escape you or your frozen eyes
Searching in the darkness
Fading out of sight
Love was here and gone like a thief in the night
Stone cold
And I thought I knew you so well
Stone cold
Can't break away from your spell
Another dark and empty night
If I was wrong I wanna make it right
But you are so distant, so far away
Your words like ice fall on the ground
Breaking the silence without a sound
Oh familiar strangers with nothing to say
Searching in the darkness
Fading out of sight
Love was here and gone like a thief in the night
Stone cold
And I thought I knew you so well
Stone cold
Can't break away from your spell
You leave me stone cold
Searching in the darkness
Fading out of sight
Love was here and gone like a thief in the night
Stone cold
And I thought I knew you so well
Stone cold
Can't break away from your spell
You're Stone cold... yeah
I can't break away from your spell
Stone cold... baby
I thought I knew you so well
You're stone cold... ice cold
Can't break away from your spell
(You put me in the deep freeze)
(Oh baby don't you leave me)
(Stone cold, you're leavin' me cold)
Stone cold
I thought I knew you so well
Stone cold
Can't break away from your spell

Keep me wondering why, when all I can do is sigh
I just wanna touch you

I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight

'Cause you give me butterflies, inside inside and I
All I gotta say is that I must be dreamin', can't be real

Guide you to the light, then
If you will be my love, baby, I will love you
Love you, 'til the end of time

I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight (Girl, you give me)
Ah, you give me butterflies, inside inside and I (I just wanna touch you)

What a drag it is getting old

"Kids are different today," I hear every mother say
Mother needs something today to calm her down
And though she's not really ill, there's a little yellow pill

She goes running for the shelter of her mother's little helper
And it helps her on her way, gets her through her busy day

"Things are different today", I hear every mother say
Cooking fresh food for a husband's just a drag
So she buys an instant cake and she burns a frozen steak

And goes running for the shelter of her mother's little helper
And two help her on her way, get her through her busy day

Doctor, please, some more of these
Outside the door, she took four more
What a drag it is getting old
"Men just aren't the same today", I hear every mother say
"They just don't appreciate that you get tired"
"They're so hard to satisfy", you can tranquilize your mind

So go running for the shelter of your mother's little helper
And four help you through the night, help to minimize your plight

Doctor, please, some more of these
Outside the door, she took four more
What a drag it is getting old

"Life's just much too hard today", I hear ev'ry mother say
The pursuit of happiness just seems a bore
And if you take more of those, you will get an overdose

No more running for the shelter of a mother's little helper
They just helped you on your way through your busy dying day
Hey



Don't want to discuss it
Think it's time for a change
You may get disgusted
Start thinking that I'm strange
That case I'll go underground
Get some heavy rest
Never have to worry
About what is worst or what is best
Oh oh Domino
Roll me over, Romeo
There you go
I said, oh oh Domino
Roll me over Romeo
There you go
I said oh oh Domino
I said oh oh Domino
There's no need for argument
There's no argument at all
And if you never hear from him
That just means he didn't call
Or vice versa
That depends on wherever you're at
And if you never hear from me
That just means I would rather not
Oh oh Domino
Roll me over, Romeo
There you go
I said, oh oh Domino
Roll me over Romeo
There you go
Say't again, oh oh Domino
I said oh oh Domino

I hope they're doin' it for free

My my, hey hey
Rock and roll is here to stay
It's better to burn out than to fade away
My my, hey hey

Out of the blue and into the black
They give you this, but you pay for that
An' once you're gone you can never come back
When you're out of the blue and into the black

The king is gone, but he's not forgotten
This is the story of a Johnny Rotten
It's better to burn out than it is to rust
The king is gone, but he's not forgotten

Hey hey, my my
Rock and roll can never die
There's more to the picture than meets the eye
Hey hey, my my



Deaf Dumb and blind boy
He's in a quiet vibration land
Strange as it seems his musical dreams
Ain't quite so bad
Ten years old
With thoughts as bold as thought can be
Loving life and becoming wise
In simplicity
Sickness will surely take the mind
Where minds can't usually go
Come on the amazing journey
And learn all you should know
A vague haze of delerium
Creeps up on me
All at once a tall stranger I suddenly see
He's dressed in a silver sparked
Glittering gown
And His golden beard flows
Nearly down to the ground
Nothing to say and nothing to hear
And nothing to see
Each sensation makes a note in my symphony
Sickness will surely take the mind
Where minds can't usually go
Come on the amazing journey
And learn all you should know
His eyes are the eyes that
Transmit all they know
Sparkle warm crystalline glances to show
That he is your leader
And he is your guide
On the amazing journey together you'll ride



Well, beat the drum and hold the phone
The sun came out today
We're born again, there's new grass on the field
A-roundin' third, and headed for home
It's a brown-eyed handsome man
Anyone can understand the way I feel

Oh, put me in, Coach
I'm ready to play today
Put me in, Coach
I'm ready to play today
Look at me, I can be centerfield

Well, I spent some time in the Mudville Nine
Watchin' it from the bench
You know I took some lumps when the Mighty Casey struck out
So say hey, Willie
Tell Ty Cobb and Joe DiMaggio
Don't say it ain't so
You know the time is now

Oh, put me in, Coach
I'm ready to play today
Put me in, Coach
I'm ready to play today
Look at me, I can be centerfield

Yeah! I got it, I got it!

Got a beat-up glove, a homemade bat, and brand-new pair of shoes
You know I think it's time to give this game a ride
Just to hit the ball and touch 'em all
A moment in the sun
(pop) It's-a gone
And you can tell that one goodbye!

Oh, put me in, Coach
I'm ready to play today
Put me in, Coach
I'm ready to play today
Look at me, yeah, I can be centerfield

Oh, put me in, Coach
I'm ready to play today
Put me in, Coach
I'm ready to play today
Look at me, gotta be centerfield
Yeah



Try to see it my way
Do I have to keep on talking till I can't go on?
While you see it your way
Run the risk of knowing that our love may soon be gone

We can work it out
We can work it out

Think of what you're saying
You can get it wrong and still you think that it's alright
Think of what I'm saying
We can work it out and get it straight or say good night

We can work it out
We can work it out

Life is very short and there's no time
For fussing and fighting, my friend
I have always thought that it's a crime
So I will ask you once again
Try to see it my way
Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong
While you see it your way
There's a chance that we might fall apart before too long

We can work it out
We can work it out

Life is very short and there's no time

Met a girl called Lola, and I took her back to my place
Feelin' guilty, feelin' scared, hidden cameras everywhere
Stop! Hold on, stay in control
Girl, I want you here with me
But I'm really not as cool as I'd like to be
'Cause there's a red under my bed
And there's a little yellow man in my head
And there's a true blue inside of me
That keeps stoppin' me, touchin' ya, watchin' ya, lovin' ya
Paranoia, the destroyer
Paranoia, the destroyer
Well, I fell asleep, then I woke, feelin' kinda queer
Lola looked at me and said, "Ooh, you look so weird"
She said, "Man, there's really something wrong with you
One day you're gonna self-destruct
You're up, you're down, I can't work you out
You get a good thing goin' then you blow yourself out
Silly boy, you self-destroyer
Silly boy, you self-destroyer
Silly boy, you got so much to live for
So much to aim for, so much to try for
You're blowing it all with paranoia
You're so insecure, you self-destroyer"
(And it goes like this, here it goes)
Paranoia, the destroyer
(Here it goes again)
Paranoia, the destroyer
Doctor, doctor help me please, I know you will understand
There's a time device inside of me, I'm a self-destructin' man
There's a red under my bed
And there's a little green man in my head
And he said, "You're not goin' crazy, you're just a bit sad
'Cause there's a man in ya, gnawin' ya, tearin' ya into two"
Silly boy, you self-destroyer
Paranoia, the destroyer
Self-destroyer, wreck your health
Destroy your friends, destroy yourself
The time device of self-destruction
Light the fuse and start eruption, yeah
(Yeah, it goes like this, here it goes)
Paranoia, the destroyer
(Here's to paranoia)
Paranoia, the destroyer
(Hey hey, here it goes)
Paranoia, the destroyer
(And it goes like this)
Paranoia, the destroyer
(And it goes like this)



Call it a split cause you know that you will
You bite your friends like chocolate
You say, we go where nobody knows
Got guns hidden under our petticoats
No we're never gonna quit it
No we're never gonna quit it, no
Now we run, run away from the boys in the blue
And my car smells like chocolate
Hey now think about what to do
I think about what to say, I think about how to think
Pause it, play it, pause it play it, pause it

Oh we go where nobody knows
With guns hidden under our petticoats
No we're never gonna quit it
No we're never gonna quit it, no
Yeah we're dressed in black from head to toe
We've got guns hidden under our petticoats
No we're never gonna quit it
No we're never gonna quit it, no

Now you're never gonna quit it
Now you're never gonna quit it
Now you're never gonna quit it
If you don't stop smoking it
That's what she said
She said we're dressed in black, head to toe
With guns hidden under our petticoats
No we're never gonna quit it
No we're never gonna quit it, no
Hey now we're building up speed as we're approaching the hill
Oh my hair smells like chocolate
Hey now you say you're gonna quit it
But you're never gonna quit it
Go get it, go get it
Got get it, go get it, go!
And play it cool

Oh we go where nobody knows
With guns hidden under our petticoats
No we're never gonna quit it
No we're never gonna quit it, no
Yeah we're dressed in black from head to toe
We've got guns hidden under our petticoats
No we're never gonna quit it
No we're never gonna quit it, no

Well I think we better go, seriously better go

Seriously better go



I take a sip of Hennessy and then get pissy drunk
I ain't a drinker, I'm a thinker, call it what you want
But if you turn your back, know that you just missed your chance
To witness the realest shit that's ever been told to man
I found myself losing focus at a Sunday service
Embarrassed so I start questioning God, "What is my purpose?"
He said to live the way he did, that's all he want from me
Spread the word and witness, he rose on the first Sunday
I said alright, enthused that my Lord gave a listen
I opened my Bible in search to be a better Christian
And this from a person that never believed in religion
But shit, my life is so fucked up, man; I can't help but give in
I'm giving testimonies to strangers I never met
Hopped on the pulpit and told them how I was truly blessed
Felt like I'm free from all my sins when the service was over
Walked out the church, then got a call that my homie was murdered
Then lost my faith again

What am I gonna do
Gotta have faith
Life is too much
I'm just through
Where is your faith?
(Don't you give up dont you give in...)
Faith
All you need is the size of a mustard seed
Single black parent from Compton raising children of four
That's four innocent bastards 'cause, papa, they don't know
Her day consists of working back and forth with babysitters
Can't find no one to watch her kids, so she pay her sister
Her baby daddy ain't 'bout shit, that nigga ain't 'bout shit
Spilt his daughter milk just to cop a new outfit
She pray to God every night, hoping that he'll mature
And maybe one day his kids something that he'll live for
Baby wanna go back to school, but she need some help
Because it's hard trying to pay the bills when you're by yourself
She thought about credit card scams, 'til she heard a voice
That said, "The Devil is a lie, make a better choice"
And so it's back to McDonald's and every month dealing
With those crazy ass people at the county building
Looked to the heavens and asked Him to make a better way
Then got a letter in the mail, lost her Section 8
Then lost her faith again

What am I gonna do
Gotta have faith
Life is too much
I'm just through
Where is your faith?
(Don't you give up dont you give in...)
Faith
All you need is the size of a mustard seed
I had dreams of holding a 9 milla to Ray's killa
Ask him why as my eyes fill up
Each day it gets more realer, orangutans bang like gorillas
It's jungle when the niggas in zoo
The rats lurking, vultures circling the serpents
Cats lying through they teeth, my nigga didn't deserve it
I flirted with the ideal of caressing the steel
To make karma come faster than she normally will
It's ill, to see my faith try and leave me
It's so hard to get it, to get rid of it is easy
I'm tryna reach Cloud 9, that's what my niggas 'bout
But it never rain in California unless the pistols out
Until then, my feet planted on the ground
Shadowboxing my conscience till my faith start responding
And if I get no answer, just know I tried
I should have never looked into his son's eyes
Rayshawn Boyce
What am I gonna do
Gotta have faith
Life is too much
I'm just through
Where is your faith?
(Don't you give up dont you give in...)
Faith
All you need is the size of a mustard seed
This for my people that stressing whenever times is hard
Your mind's slipping, wondering, "Is there really a God?"
Knowing you shouldn't think that way and trying to freeze your brain
But whenever there's pain, that feeling forever remains
We can't believe what we can't see and reality seems stronger than prayer
Cause you tried to change your life, and now you live in a wheelchair
And your son was born with cancer and he live in urgent care
At the tender age of 12, and you feel that no one cares
Searching for answers, that's human nature, you ain't in the wrong
Just know when you feeling that way His Spirit's in the room
I watched people I know pray and catch the Holy Ghost
And wonder why I ain't ever caught that feeling before
Maybe they know Him better, or I don't know no better
But what I do know, is that He's real and He lives forever
So the next time you feel like your world's about to end
I hope you studied because He's testing your faith again

I'd rather not live like there isn't a God
Than die and find out there really is
Think about it



You've got me captured, I'm under your spell
I guess I'll never learn
I have your picture, yes, I know it well
Another page is turned
Are you for real? It's so hard to tell
From just a magazine
Yeah, you just smile and the picture sells
Look what that does to me

I'll wait till your love comes down
I'm coming straight for your heart
No way you can stop me now
As fine as you are

I wrote a letter and told her these words
That meant a lot to me
I never sent it, she wouldn't have heard
Her eyes don't follow me
And while she watches, I can never be free
Such good photography

I'll wait till your love comes down
I'm coming straight for your heart
No way you can stop me now
As fine as you are

You can't imagine what your image means
The pages come alive
Your magic greets everyone who reads
Heartbreak in motor drive
Are you for real? It's so hard to tell
From just a magazine
Yeah, you just smile and the picture sells
Look what that does to me

I'll wait till your love comes down
I'm coming straight for your heart
No way you can stop me now
As fine as you are
I'll wait till your love comes down
I'm coming straight for your heart
No way you can stop me now
As fine as you are
I'll wait



Mary Mac, all dressed in black
Silver buttons up and down her back
High, low, tipsy toe
She broke a needle now she can't sew

Walkin' the dog
I'm just walkin' your dog
Well if you don't know how to do it
I'll show you how to walk the dog

Ask my mama for 15 cents
To see the elephant jump the fence
It jumped so high it touched the sky
Didn't come back 'til the 4th of July

Walkin' the dog
I'm just walkin' your dog
Well if you don't know how to do it
I'll show you how to walk the dog

Ha, uh, ha, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh

Mary, Mary, quite contrary
How does your garden grow?
Well well, silver bells and little bitty bitty white shells
Pretty maids all in a row

Walkin' your dog
I'm just walkin' your dog
Well if you don't know how to do it
I'll show you how to walk the dog
Well if you don't know how to do it
I'll show you how to walk the dog
Well if you don't know how to do it
I'll show you how to walk the dog



A gypsy wind is blowin' warm tonight
The sky is starlit and the time is right
And still you're tellin' me you have to go
Before you leave there's something you should know
Yeah something you should know babe
I've seen you smilin' in the summer sun
I've seen your long hair flying when you run
I've made my mind up that it's meant to be
Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me

Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me
Out where the rivers meet the soundin' sea
You're high above me now, you're wild and free
Ah but someday lady you'll accomp'ny me
Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me

Some people say that love's a losin' game
You start with fire but you lose the flame
The ashes smolder but the warmth's soon gone
You end up cold and lonely on your own
I'll take my chances babe, I'll risk it all
I'll win your love or I'll take the fall
I've made my mind up girl it's meant to be
Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me
Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me
It's written down somewhere, it's got to be
You're high above me flyin' wild and free
Oh but someday lady you'll accomp'ny me
Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me
Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me
Out where the rivers meet the sounding sea
I feel it in my soul, it's meant to be
Ohh someday lady you'll accomp'ny me
Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me



I got a little change in my pocket going jing-a-ling-a-ling
Wanna call you on the telephone, baby, I give you a ring
But each time we talk, I get the same old thing
Always, "No huggee, no kissee until I get a wedding ring"

My honey, my baby
Don't put my love upon no shelf
She said
"Don't hand me no lines and keep your hands to yourself"

Ooh, baby, baby, baby
Why you gonna treat me this way?
You know I'm still your loverboy
I still feel the same way
That's when she told me a story 'bout free milk and a cow
And said
"No huggee, no kissee until I get a wedding vow"

My honey, my baby
Don't put my love upon no shelf
She said
"Don't hand me no lines and keep your hands to yourself"

You see, I wanted her real bad and I was about to give in
That's when she started talking about true love
Started talking about sin
I said
"Honey, I'll live with you for the rest of my life"
She said
No huggee, no kissee until you make me a wife"

My honey, my baby
Don't put my love upon no shelf
She said
"Don't hand me no lines and keep your hands to yourself"



Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better

The king of Marigold was in the kitchen
Cooking breakfast for the queen
The queen was in the parlour
Playing piano for the children of the king

Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry baby cry

The king was in the garden
Picking flowers for a friend who came to play
The queen was in the playroom
Painting pictures for the children's holiday

Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry baby cry
The duchess of Kircaldy always smiling
And arriving late for tea
The duke was having problems
With a message at the local Bird and Bee

Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry baby cry

At twelve o'clock a meeting round the table
For a seance in the dark
With voices out of nowhere
Put on specially by the children for a lark

Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry baby cry
Cry cry cry baby
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry baby cry
Can you take me back where I came from?
Can you take me back?
Can you take me back where I came from?
Brother, can you take me back?
Can you take me back?
Mm, can you take me where I came from?
Can you take me back?



Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself
Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself
You say I've been spending my money on other women
Taking money from someone else

I called your mama about three or four nights ago
I called your mama about three or four nights ago
Well your mama said, "Son, don't call my daughter no more"

Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself
Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself
You say I've been spending my money on other women
You've been taking money from someone else

Come back home, baby, try my love one more time
Come back home, baby, try my love one more time
You know I don't know how to quit you, I'm gonna lose my mind

Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself
Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself
You say I've been spending my money on other women
You're taking money from someone else

So I'm back, to the velvet underground
Back to the floor, that I love
To a room with some lace and paper flowers
Back to the gypsy that I was
To the gypsy that I was

And it all comes down to you
Well you know that it does
And lightning strikes, maybe once, maybe twice
Oh, and it lights up the night
And you see your gypsy
You see your gypsy

To the gypsy that remains
Faces freedom with a little fear
I have no fear, I have only love
And if I was a child
And the child was enough
Enough for me to love
Enough to love

She is dancing away from me now
She was just a wish
She was just a wish
And a memory is all that is left for you now
You see your gypsy, oh
You see your gypsy
Lightning strikes, maybe once, maybe twice
And it all comes down to you
And it all comes down to you
Lightning strikes, maybe once, maybe twice
And it all comes down to you
And it all comes down to you

I still see your bright eyes, bright eyes
And it all comes down to you
I still see your bright eyes, bright eyes
And it all comes down to you
I still see your bright eyes, bright eyes
(She was just a wish)
(She was just a wish)
And it all comes down to you
Lightning strikes, maybe once, maybe twice
And it all comes down to you



If you feel that it's real, I'm on trial
And I'm here, yeah, in your prison
Like a coin in your mint
I am dented and I'm spent with high treason

Through a glass eye, your throne
Is the one danger zone
Take me to the pilot for control
Take me to the pilot of your soul

Take me to the pilot, lead me through the chamber
Take me to the pilot, I am but a stranger
Take me to the pilot, lead me through the chamber
Take me to the pilot, I am but a stranger

What I'm told is never, never for certain
Through a glass eye, your throne

Take me to the pilot for control
Take me to the pilot of your soul

Yeah, yeah, take me to the pilot, lead me through the chamber
Take me to the pilot, I am but a stranger

And leave it dripping green and red like double cheeseburgers
Chewing on cum like bubblegum from Hubba
This bitch knew dick like Bubba knew shrimp (Hahahaha)

Yo, I'm seventeen, already sniffing blow
I tell my friends it's asthma every time I start to itch my throat
I got a new show for MTV: "Pimp My Boat"
Because some bitch said my semen was dirty, that silly ho

The pressure is the pump, and the pressure is us
Bitches having eargasms, and the pleasure is us

Let me run with you tonight
I'll take you on a moonlight ride
There's someone I used to see
But she don't give a damn for me

But let me get to the point, let's roll another joint
And turn the radio loud, I'm too alone to be proud
You don't know how it feels
You don't know how it feels to be me

People come, people go
Some grow young, some grow cold
I woke up in between
A memory and a dream

So let's get to the point, let's roll another joint
And let's head on down the road, there's somewhere I gotta go
You don't know how it feels
You don't know how it feels to be me
My old man was born to rock
He's still tryin' to beat the clock
Think of me what you will
I've got a little space to fill

So let's get to the point, let's roll another joint
And let's head on down the road, there's somewhere I gotta go
You don't know how it feels
You don't know how it feels
No, you don't know how it feels to be me
You don't know how it feels
You don't know how it feels
No, you don't know how it feels to be me



Emily tries but misunderstands (Ah, ooh)
She's often inclined to borrow somebody’s dreams 'til tomorrow

There is no other day
Let’s try it another way
You’ll lose your mind and play
Free games for May
See Emily play

Soon after dark, Emily cries (Ah, ooh)
Gazing through trees in sorrow, hardly a sound 'til tomorrow

There is no other day
Let's try it another way
You’ll lose your mind and play
Free games for May
See Emily play

Put on a gown that touches the ground (Ah, ooh)
Float on a river forever and ever, Emily (Emily)
There is no other day
Let's try it another way
You’ll lose your mind and play
Free games for May
See Emily play



Well, I never kept a dollar past sunset
It always burned a hole in my pants
Never made a school mama happy
Never blew a second chance, oh no

I need a love to keep me happy
I need a love to keep me happy
Baby, baby, keep me happy
Baby, baby, keep me happy

Always took candy from strangers
Didn't wanna get me no trade
Never want to be like papa
Working for the boss every night and day

I need a love to keep me happy
I need a love
Baby, won't you keep me happy?
Baby, won't you keep me happy? (Happy)
Baby, please keep me

I need a love to keep me happy
I need a love to keep me happy
Baby, baby, keep me happy
Baby
Never got a flash out of cocktails
When I got some flesh off the bone
Never got a lift out of Lear jets
When I can fly way back home

I need a love to keep me happy
I need a love to keep me happy
Baby, baby, keep me happy
Baby, baby, keep me happy
Baby

Happy
Baby, won't you keep me happy
Baby, won't you keep me happy
Baby, won't you keep me happy
Baby, won't you keep me happy
Baby, won't you keep me happy
Oh, keep, oh, baby, keep me happy
Now, baby, won't you keep me happy
Baby, got me feeling happy
Now, now, now, now, now, happy
Come on now, keep me happy
Keep on, baby, keep me happy



I'm breakin' rocks in the hot sun
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won
I needed money 'cause I had none
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won

I left my baby and I feel so bad
I guess my race is run
Oh, she's the best girl I ever had
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won

I'm robbin' people with a six-gun
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won
I miss my baby and the good fun
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won

I left my baby and I feel so bad
I guess my race is run
Oh, she's the best girl I ever had
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won



Paroles de la chanson Yesterday :
Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they’re here to stay
Oh, I believe in yesterday
Suddenly, I’m not half the man I used to be
There’s a shadow hanging over me
Oh, yesterday came suddenly
Why she had to go I don’t know she woldn’t say
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday
Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday
Mm mm mm mm mm



I remember findin' out about you
Every day, my mind is all around you

Lookin' out from my lonely room, day after day
Bring it home, baby, make it soon
I give my love to you

I remember holdin' you while you sleep
Every day I feel the tears that you weep

Lookin' out of my lonely gloom, day after day
Bring it home, baby, make it soon
I give my love to you


Lookin' out of my lonely room, day after day
Bring it home, baby, make it soon
I give my love to you

I remember findin' out about you
Every day my mind is all around you
Lookin' out of my lonely gloom, day after day
Bring it home, baby, make it soon
I give my love to you



{Intro}
I was once out strolling
One very hot summer's day
When I thought I'd lay myself down to rest
In a big field of tall grass
I lay there in the sun
And felt it caressing my face
As I fell asleep and dreamed
I dreamed I was in a Hollywood movie, yes I did
And that I was the star of the movie
This really blew my mind
The fact that me, an overfed long-haired, leaping gnome
Should be the star of a Hollywood movie
But there I was
I was taken to a place:
The Hall of the Mountain King
I stood high up on a mountaintop
Naked to the world
In front of
Every kind of girl
There was long ones, tall ones, short ones, brown ones
Black ones, round ones, big ones
Crazy ones
Out of the middle
Came a lady
She whispered in my ear
Something crazy
She said:
Spill the wine, dig that girl
Spill the wine, take that pearl
I thought to myself
What could that mean?
Am I going crazy
Or is this just a dream?
Now wait a minute - I know I'm lying in a field of grass somewhere
So it's all in my head
And then
I heard her say
...one more time:
Spill the wine take that pearl
I could feel hot flames of fire roaring at my back
As she disappeared
But soon she returned
In her hand was a bottle of wine
In the other, a glass
She poured some of the wine from the bottle into the glass
And raised it to her lips
And just before she drunk it
She said:
Take the wine, take that pearl
Spill the wine, take that pearl



Well I dreamed I saw the knights in armor comin'
Sayin' something about a queen
There were peasants singin' and drummers drummin'
And the archer split the tree
There was a fanfare blowin' to the sun
That was floating on the breeze
Look at Mother Nature on the run
In the 1970s
Look at Mother Nature on the run
In the 1970s

I was lyin' in a burned out basement
With the full moon in my eyes
I was hopin' for replacement
When the sun burst though the sky
There was a band playin' in my head
And I felt like getting high
I was thinkin' about what a friend had said
I was hopin' it was a lie
Thinkin' about what a friend had said
I was hopin' it was a lie

Well, I dreamed I saw the silver space ships flyin'
In the yellow haze of the sun
There were children cryin' and colors flyin'
All around the chosen ones
All in a dream, all in a dream
The loadin' had begun
Flying Mother Nature's silver seed
To a new home in the sun
Flying Mother Nature's silver seed
To a new home



Is it you again outside
Just banging on the front door?
You say you had enough
Now you're coming back for more

But that's alright
I said that, "That's alright"
I may not want to admit it
I'm just a fool for your stockings, I believe
Now, I don't mind when you send money
And bring your girlfriends with you
But how could one be so thoughtless to try
And handle less than two?

But that's alright
I said that, "That's alright baby"
I may not want to admit it
I'm just a fool for your stocking
I believe, yeah

Now, I'm telling everybody
It seems too good to be true
Sweet things can always get sweeter
I know mine did, how about you?

Yes, it's alright
I said yes it, yes it is, "That's alright"
I may not want to admit it
I'm just a fool for your stockings, I believe



Well come on
All you people
The time has come to get together
You gotta have a little rock 'n' roll music
To get you through the stormy weather
Just do whatever you feel
When you let go
Nothing's gonna help you more than rock 'n' roll

So come on, put you hands together
Yeah come on, put your hands together
Well come on, you know it's now or never

Oh that funky feeling
Is what you need to get you through
Yeah you oughta know
I'll tell you something
Don't let your troubles get to you
Cause win or lose it's alright
When you let go
Nothing's gonna help you more than rock 'n' roll
So come on, put you hands together
Yeah come on, put your hands together
Well come on, you know it's now or never
Take a chance on rock 'n' roll

It's up to you, you can do what you like

Psst! Come here!
I hear the music, daylight disc
Three men in black said, "don't report this...
Ascension" and that's all they said
Sickness now the hour of dread

All praise
He's found the awful truth
Balthazar
He's found the saucer news

Wait! there's more…
I'm in fairy rings and tower beds
"Don't report this," three men said
Books by blameless and by the dead
King in yellow, the Queen in red

All praise
He's found the awful truth
Balthazar
He's found the saucer news
Dead leaves always give up motion
I no longer feel emotion
When prophecy fails the falling notion
Don't report this
Agents of Fortune

All praise
He's found the awful truth
Balthazar
He's found the saucer news



Just a small-town girl
Livin' in a lonely world
She took the midnight train goin' anywhere
Just a city boy
Born and raised in South Detroit
He took the midnight train goin' anywhere


A singer in a smoky room
The smell of wine and cheap perfume
For a smile, they can share the night
It goes on and on and on and on

Strangers waitin'
Up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searchin' in the night
Streetlight people
Livin' just to find emotion
Hidin' somewhere in the night

Workin' hard to get my fill
Everybody wants a thrill
Payin' anything to roll the dice just one more time
Some will win, some will lose
Some are born to sing the blues
Oh, the movie never ends
It goes on and on and on and on
Strangers waitin'
Up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searchin' in the night
Streetlight people
Livin' just to find emotion
Hidin' somewhere in the night


Don't stop believin'
Hold on to that feeling
Streetlight people
Don't stop believin'
Hold on
Streetlight people
Don't stop believin'
Hold on to that feeling
Streetlight people



Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, turn this up
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah
We got gelato bumping, bass pumping, plates jumping, woo!
And he stunting and he stunting, they ain't nothing
Got gelato puffing, bass pumping, plates jumping, woo!
And he stunting and he stunting, they ain't nothing, yeah

I'm so froze, every day feel like February
Zombie Gang, we the best, I'm feeling legendary
I just switch up my flows, I just switch up my hoes
Picture me in a Porsche, yeah, picture me I'm a boss, yeah
Her pussy wet like a faucet
I'm getting head like I'm ballin'
They wanna seem me 'til I'm falling
This ain't a game, I put it all here
ViH, you niggas know the face
Flatbush King, you niggas know the place
I'm might be outside pushing weight
Keep your eyes wide for the Jakes
Hulk Hogan with the fucking weight
Will I make it to the Pearly Gates?
Donald Trump, he a fucking fake
Will we live to see another great?
You ever feel like you wanna die?
You ever feel like you wanna fry?
If it's me then I just wonder why
If it's me, I just wonder why
I believe this shit is destined for me
I repeat this shit is legendary
Winning winning now we all win
Winning winning now we all win
I believe this shit is destined for me
I repeat this shit is legendary
Winning winning now we all win
Winning winning now we all win

Fronto burning like an incense
Can you see me? Fix your lenses
Independent nigga on a mission
I ain't listen when they tell me different
Now I'm out of state, I'm out of shape
Feet up chilling, grilling by the lake
On the line with Juice's major cake
Flatbush niggas on the paper chase
Running with me, got a hundred with me
Henny sipping and they with the shits
Take your pick I switch my shit
Copy me, I switch my shit
Biting niggas know your role
Shut your mouth, I smack down
Everywhere I'm getting pat down
Hard to ignore the good black child
Funny thing is I ain't with the gimmicks
I ain't here to give you grievance, no
I just think it's time to educate you
How there's levels to this shit could go
Nappy dreads are swinging now, got to give me another prayer
Another nigga lose his life, another nigga wasn't there
I believe this shit is destined for me
I repeat this shit is legendary
Winning winning now we all win
Winning winning now we all win
I believe this shit is destined for me
I repeat this shit is legendary
Winning winning now we all win
Winning winning now we all win

Summertime tripping, I'm Janis Joplin
Cut off that bitch like Lorena Bobbitt
Not in the Hills, I'm in Brooklyn, homie
Invented the swag, bro is you mad?
I fucked your bitch sent her home in the cab
Hollywood blonde, Yves Saint Laurent
Dior I’m fleeior, I’m smoking a bong
Re-stash the jar I got pounds in the trunk
They thought I was done but I can't get enough
Sinners to villians who don't get to finish
You're not competition, you live on the internet
I make it juicy, my baby gon' call me back
On the track, own the track, ándale, run it back
Double back, used to move shhh, like a running back
If it ain't about a dollar, won't hit you back
Niggas talk shit like a dollar strap
I believe this shit is legendary
Dump your favorite artist in the cemetery
Ain't new to this, ain't no worry
Since 2012, niggas honorary
Sherb & ‘Lato when I'm out in Paris
Bitch scream my name like I'm Bloody Mary
And this game is heavy, came prepared to press your buttons
Don't be there for nothing, Zombies up to something
Man these niggas buying muscles now
Eating mussels, driving muscle cars
Must be something in the water, all us got a bone to pick
At 26, I felt so infinite
I'm pissed I couldn't get a grip
I slipped the fish and ever since, I missed the system
My assistant with a pistol pushed me to the edge
Put a ransom on your head nigga

I believe this shit is destined for me
I repeat this shit is legendary
Winning winning now we all win
Winning winning now we all win
I believe this shit is destined for me
I repeat this shit is legendary
Winning winning now we all win
Winning winning now we all win



Jim Dandy to the rescue!
Jim Dandy to the rescue!
Jim Dandy to the rescue!
Go, Jim Dandy! Go, Jim Dandy!
I was sitting on a mountain top
30,000 feet to drop
Tied me on a runaway horse
Uh huh, that's right, of course
Jim Dandy to the rescue!
Go, Jim Dandy! Go, Jim Dandy!
One day, I met a girl named Sue
She was feeling kind of blue
I'm Dandy, the kind of guy
Who can't stand to see a little girl cry
Jim Dandy to the rescue!
Go, Jim Dandy! Go, Jim Dandy!
Jim Dandy to the rescue!
Jim Dandy to the rescue!
Jim Dandy to the rescue!
Go, Jim Dandy! Go, Jim Dandy!
I was riding on a submarine
Got a message from my mermaid queen
She was hanging on a fishing line
Mr. Dandy didn't waste no time!
Jim Dandy to the rescue!
Go, Jim Dandy! Go, Jim Dandy!
Once upon a time, I went to Maine
Got a ticket on a DC plane
Mr. Dandy didn't need no chute!
I was high and ready to boot!
Jim Dandy to the rescue!
Go, Jim Dandy! Go, Jim Dandy!
Jim Dandy to the rescue!
Jim Dandy to the rescue!
Jim Dandy to the rescue!
Go, Jim Dandy! Go, Jim Dandy!



Let's swim to the moon, uh huh
Let's climb through the tide
Penetrate the evening that the
City sleeps to hide
Let's swim out tonight, love
It's our turn to try
Parked beside the ocean
On our moonlight drive

Let's swim to the moon, uh huh
Let's climb through the tide
Surrender to the waiting worlds
That lap against our side
Nothing left open
And no time to decide
We've stepped into a river
On our moonlight drive

Let's swim to the moon
Let's climb through the tide
You reach your hand to hold me
But I can't be your guide
Easy, I love you
As I watch you glide
Falling through wet forests
On our moonlight drive, baby
Moonlight drive
Come on baby, gonna take a little ride
Down, down by the ocean side
Gonna get real close
Get real tight
Baby gonna drown tonight
Goin' down, down, down



I'm traveling down the road and I'm flirting with disaster
I got the pedal to floor, my life is running faster
I'm out of money, out of hope, it looks like self destruction
Well, how much more can you take with all of this corruption?

We're flirtin' with disaster, ya'll know what I mean
And the way we run our lives it makes no sense to me
I don't know about yourself or what you want to be, yeah
When we gamble with our time we choose our destiny

I'm travelin' down that lonesome road
Feel like I'm dragging a heavy load
Yeah, I've tried to turn my head away
Feel about the same most every day
You know what I'm talking about

Speeding down the fast lane and honey we're playin' from town to town
The boys and I been burnin' it up, can't seem to slow it down
I got the pedal to the floor our lives are runnin' faster
We got our sights set straight ahead but I ain't sure what we're after
We're flirtin' with disaster, ya'll damn sure know what I mean
And the way we run our lives it makes no sense to me
I don't know about yourself or what you plan to be, yeah
When we gamble with our time we choose our destiny

Yeah, we're traveling down that lonesome road
Feel like I'm dragging a heavy load
Though I try to turn my head away
I'm flirtin' with disaster every day
And you are too baby
It ain't for everybody
Oh come on man


Flirtin' with disaster, babe, y'all know what I mean
You know the way we run our lives, it makes no sense to me
I don't know about yourself or what you plan to be
When we gamble with our time, we choose our destiny

Yeah, we're traveling down this lonesome road
Feel like I'm dragging a heavy load
Though I try to turn my head away ba ba ba yeah
We're flirtin' with disaster every day



You gave me something, I understand
You gave me loving in the palm of my hand

I can't tell you how I feel
My heart is like a wheel

Let me roll it
Let me roll it to you
Let me roll it
Let me roll it to you

I want to tell you, and now's the time
I want to tell you that you're going to be mine

I can't tell you how I feel
My heart is like a wheel

Let me roll it
Let me roll it to you
Let me roll it

I can't tell you how I feel
My heart is like a wheel

You gave me something, I understand
You gave me loving in the palm of my hand

I can't tell you how I feel
My heart is like a wheel

Let me roll it
Let me roll it to you
Let me roll it
Let me roll it to you



Thrown like a star in my vast sleep
I open my eyes to take a peep
To find that I was by the sea
Me gazing with tranquility

It was then when the Hurdy Gurdy Man
Came singing songs of love
Then when the Hurdy Gurdy Man
Came singing songs of love

"Hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy, gurdy", he sang
"Hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy, gurdy", he sang
"Hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy, gurdy", he sang


Histories of ages past
Unenlightened shadows cast
Down through all eternity
The crying of humanity

It is then when the Hurdy Gurdy Man
Comes singing songs of love
Then when the Hurdy Gurdy Man
Comes singing songs of love
"Hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy, gurdy", he sang
"Hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy
Hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy, gurdy", he sang

"Hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy, gurdy", he sang
Here comes the Roly Poly Man and he's singing songs of love
"Roly poly, roly poly, roly poly, poly", he sang
"Hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy, gurdy", he sang
"Hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy, gurdy", he sang

When truth gets very deep
Beneath a thousand years of sleep
Time demands a turn around
And once again the truth is found
Yeah, George
Awakening the Hurdy Gurdy Man
Who comes singing the songs of love
Beatles were Hurdy Gurdy Men
They came singing you songs of love
I am the Hurdy Gurdy Man
I come singing the songs of love
"Hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy, gurdy", he sang
"Hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy, gurdy", he sang
"Hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy, gurdy", he sang
"Hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy, gurdy", he sang



Sick at heart and lonely
Deep in dark despair
Thinking one thought only
"Where is she, tell me where?"

And if she says to you
She don't love me
Just give her my message
Tell her of my plea

And I know
That if she had me back again
I would never make her sad
I've got a heart full of soul


And I know
If she had me back again
I would never make her sad
I've got a heart full of soul
She's been gone such a long time
Longer than I can bear
But if she says she wants me
Tell her that I'll be there

And if she says to you
She don't love me
Just give her my message
Tell her of my plea

And I know
That if she had me back again
I would never make her sad
I've got a heart full of soul



Well, I think it's time to get ready
To realize just what I have found
I have lived only half of what I am
It's all clear to me now
My heart is on fire
My soul's like a wheel that's turnin'
My love is alive
My love is alive, yeah, girl, yeah
There's something inside that's making me crazy
I'll try to keep it together
'Cause what I say may not happen the same way
Now could be forever
My heart is on fire
My soul's like a wheel that's turnin'
My love is alive
My love is alive, yeah, girl, yeah
My love is alive
Woo hoo, my love is alive
There's a mirror moving inside my mind
Reflecting the love that you shine on me
Hold on now to that feeling
Let it flow, let it grow, yeah, yeah
My heart is on fire
My soul's like a wheel that's turnin'
My love is alive
My love is alive, yeah, girl, yeah
My love is alive
Woo hoo, my love is alive
Woo hoo, my love is alive
My love is alive
Woo hoo, my love is alive
Woo hoo, my love is alive
Woo hoo, my love is alive
Woo hoo



Well, I'm not uptight
Not unattractive
Turn me on tonight
'Cause I'm radioactive
Radioactive
There's not a fight
And I'm not your captive
Turn me loose tonight
'Cause I'm radioactive
Radioactive
I want to stay with you
I want to play with you, baby
I want to lay with you
And I want you to know
Got to concentrate
Don't be distractive
Turn me on tonight
'Cause I'm radioactive
Radioactive
Radioactive
Radioactive
I want to stay with you
I don't want to play with you
I want just to lay with you
And I want you to know
Got to concentrate
Don't be distractive
Turn me loose tonight
'Cause I'm radioactive, oh, yeah
Oh, yeah, radioactive
Don't you stand, stand too close
You might catch it



Every night I'm lying in bed
Holding you close in my dreams
Thinking about all the things that we said
And coming apart at the seams

We try to talk it over
But the words come out too rough

I know you were trying
To give me the best of your love

Beautiful faces
And loud, empty places
Look at the way that we live
Wasting our time on cheap talk and wine
Left us so little to give

That same old crowd
Was like a cold dark cloud
That we could never rise above
But here in my heart
I give you the best of my love

Oh sweet darling
You get the best of my love
Oh Sweet darling
You get the best of my love

I'm going back in time
And it's a sweet dream
It was a quiet night
And I would be all right
If I could go on sleeping

But every morning
I wake up and worry
What's gonna happen today
You see it your way
And I see it mine
But we both see it slippin' away

You know we always had each other baby
I guess that wasn't enough
Oh, but here in my heart
I give you the best of my love

Oh sweet darling
You get the best of my love
Oh sweet darling
You get the best of my love
Oh sweet darling
You get the best of my love
Oh sweet darling
You get the best of my love
Oh sweet darling
You get the best of my love
Oh sweet darling
You get the best of my love
Oh sweet darling
You get the best of my love
Oh sweet darling
You get the best of my love
Oh sweet darling
You get the best of my love
Oh sweet darling
You get the best of my love



Nobody feels any pain
Tonight as I stand inside the rain
Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
Have fallen from her curls

She takes just like a woman, yeah she does
She makes love just like a woman, yeah she does
And she aches just like a woman
But she breaks just like a little girl

Queen Mary, she's my friend
Yes, I believe I'll go see her again
Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
'Til she finally sees that she's like all the rest
With her fog, her amphetamine and her pearls

She takes just like a woman, yes
She makes love just like a woman, yeah she does
And she aches just like a woman
But she breaks just like a little girl
Yeah, it was raining from the first
And I was dying there of thirst
So I came in here
And your long-time curse hurts
But what's worse
Is this pain in here
I can't stay in here

Ain't it clear that I just can't fit
Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit
But when we meet again, introduced as friends
Please don't let on that you knew me when
I was hungry and it was your world

Ah, you fake just like a woman, yes, you do
You make love just like a woman, yes, you do
Then you ache just like a woman
But ya' break just like a little girl



Oh yeah

Now Ziggy played guitar
Jamming good with Weird and Gilly
And The Spiders from Mars
He played it left hand
But made it too far
Became the special man
Then we were Ziggy's Band

Ziggy really sang
Screwed up eyes and screwed down hairdo
Like some cat from Japan
He could lick 'em by smiling
He could leave 'em to hang
He came on so loaded, man,
Well hung, snow white tan

So where were the spiders
While the fly tried to break our balls?
Just the beer light to guide us
So we bitched about his fans
And should we crush his sweet hands?
Oh yeah
Ziggy played for time
Jiving us that we were Voodoo
The kids was just crass
He was the naz
With God-given ass
He took it all too far
But boy, could he play guitar

Making love with his ego
Ziggy sucked up into his mind (ah)
Like a leper messiah
When the kids had killed a man
I had to break up the band

Oh yeah
Ooh

Ziggy played guitar



Nine miles of two-strand topped with barbed wire laid by the father for the son
Good shelter down there on the valley floor, down by where the sweet stream run
Now they might give me compensation...
That's not what I'm chasing. I was a rich man before yesterday
Now all I have got is a cheque and a pickup truck
I left my farm on the freeway
They're busy building airports on the south side...
Silicon chip factory on the east
And the big road's pushing through along the valley floor
Hot machine pouring six lanes at the very least
Now, they say they gave me compensation...
That's not what I'm chasing. I was a rich man before yesterday
Now all I have left is a broken-down pickup truck
Looks like my farm is a freeway
They forgot they told us what this old land was for
Grow two tons the acre, boy, between the stones
This was no Southfork, it was no Ponderosa
But it was the place that I called home
They say they gave me compensation...
That's not what I'm chasing. I was a rich man before yesterday
And what do I want with a million dollars and a pickup truck?
When I left my farm under the freeway



Beth, I hear you calling
But I can't come home right now
Me and the boys are playing
And we just can't find the sound

Just a few more hours
And I'll be right home to you
I think I hear them calling
Oh, Beth, what can I do? Beth, what can I do?

You say you feel so empty
That our house just ain't a home
And I'm always somewhere else
And you're always there alone

Just a few more hours
And I'll be right home to you
I think I hear them calling
Oh, Beth, what can I do? Beth, what can I do?

Beth, I know you're lonely
And I hope you'll be alright
'Cause me and the boys will be playing
All night



Won't you take me back to school?
I need to learn the golden rule
Won't you lay it on the line?
I need to hear it just one more time

Oh, won't you tell me again?
Oh, can you feel it?
Oh, won't you tell me again tonight?

Each and every heart it seems
Is bounded by a world of dreams
Each and every rising sun
Is greeted by a lonely one

Oh, won't you tell me again?
Oh, can you feel it?
Oh, won't you tell me again tonight? Tonight?

Cause out on the ocean of life my love
There are so many storms we must rise above
Can you hear the spirit calling, as it's carried across the waves?
You're already falling it's calling you back to face the music
And the song that is coming through
You're already falling the one that it's calling is you
Make a promise take a vow
And trust your feelings it's easy now
Understand the voice within
And feel a change already beginning

Oh, won't you tell me again?
Oh, can you feel it?
Oh, won't you tell me again tonight?


Oh, won't you tell me again?
Oh, can you feel it?
Oh, won't you tell me again tonight? Tonight?

And how many words have I got to say?
And how many times will it be this way?
With your arms around the future and your back up against the past
You're already falling it's calling you on to face the music
And the song that is coming through
You're already falling the one that it's calling is you
Each and every heart it seems
Is bounded by a world of dreams
Each and every rising sun
Is greeted by, a lonely, lonely one

Won't you tell me again?
Oh, can you feel it?
Oh, won't you tell me again tonight?

Oh, won't you tell me again?
Oh, can you feel it?
Oh, won't you tell me again tonight? Tonight?
Oh, can you feel it?
Oh, won't you tell me again tonight?



Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?
It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

So hello from the other side (Other side)
I must've called a thousand times (Thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside (outside)
At least, I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
Ooh, anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
Ooh, anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
Ooh, anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
Anymore

Hello from the other side (Other side)
I must've called a thousand times (Thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside (outside)
At least, I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

He's a real nowhere man
Sitting in his nowhere land
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody

Doesn't have a point of view
Knows not where he's going to
Isn't he a bit like you and me?

Nowhere man, please, listen
You don't know what you're missing
Nowhere man, the world is at your command

He's as blind as he can be
Just sees what he wants to see
Nowhere man, can you see me at all?

Nowhere man, don't worry
Take your time, don't hurry
Leave it all 'till somebody else lends you a hand

Doesn't have a point of view
Knows not where he's going to
Isn't he a bit like you and me?
Nowhere man, please, listen
You don't know what you're missing
Nowhere man, the world is at your command

He's a real nowhere man
Sitting in his nowhere land
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody



How many more times treat me the way you wanna do?
How many more times treat me the way you wanna do?

I'll give you all I've got to give, rings, pearls, and all
I've got to get you together, baby

Oh, when's the last time I done asked you?

2:11 - 4:08

I was a young man, I couldn't resist
Started thinking it over, just what I had missed
Got me a girl and I kissed her and then and then
Whoops, oh no, yeah, well I did it again
Now I' got ten children of my own
I got another child on the way, that makes eleven
But I'm in constant heaven
I know it's all right in my mind
'Cause I got a little schoolgirl and she's all mine
I can't get through to her cause it doesn't permit
But I'm gonna give her everything I've got to give
Oh, Rosie, oh, girl
Oh, Rosie, oh, girl
Steal away now, steal away
Steal away baby, steal away
Little Robert Anthony wants to come and play
Why don't you come to me, baby
Steal away, alright, alright

Well they call me the hunter
That's my name
They call me the hunter
That's how I got my fame
Ain't no need to hide
Ain't no need to run
'Cause I've got you in the sights of my gun

How many more times, barrel house all night long, alright
How many more times, barrel house all night long?
Well, I've got to get to you, baby
So, please come home

Why don't you listen to me, baby?
Why don't you please come home?
Why don't you please come home?
Why don't you please come home?



I'm up on the tight wire
One side's ice and one is fire
It's a circus game with you and me
I'm up on the tightrope
One side's hate and one is hope
But the top hat on my head is all you see
And the wire seems to be the only place for me
A comedy of errors and I'm falling
Like a rubber-neck giraffe
You look into my past
Well maybe you're just too blind to - see
I'm up in the spotlight
Oh, does it feel right
Oh, the altitude seems to get to me
I'm up on the tight wire
Flanked by life and the funeral pyre
Putting on a show for you to see

Like a rubber-neck giraffe
You look into my past
Well maybe you're just too blind to - see
I'm up in the spotlight
Oh does it feel right
Oh the altitude really gets to get to me
I'm up on the tight wire
Flanked by life and the funeral pyre
Putting on a show for you to see



I would love to tour the Southland
In a travelling minstrel show
Yes, I'd love to tour the Southland
In a traveling minstrel show
Yes, I'm dying to be a star and make them laugh
Sound just like a record on the phonograph

Those days are gone forever
Over a long time ago, oh yeah
Hey, hey!
I have never met Napoleon
But I plan to find the time
I have never met Napoleon
But I plan to find the time, yes I do
Cause he looks so fine upon that hill
They tell me he was lonely, he's lonely still

Those days are gone forever
Over a long time ago, oh yeah

I stepped up on the platform
The man gave me the news
He said, You must be joking son
Where did you get those shoes?
Where did you get those shoes?
Well, I've seen 'em on the TV, the movie show
They say the times are changing but I just don't know

These things are gone forever
Over a long time ago, oh yeah
Oh yeah, hey, hey!



Desert sky, dream beneath the desert sky
The rivers run but soon run dry
We need new dreams tonight
Desert rose, dreamed I saw a desert rose
Dress torn in ribbons and in bows
Like a siren she calls (to me)

Sleep comes like a drug in God's country
Sad eyes, crooked crosses, in God's country

Set me alight, we'll punch a hole right through the night
Every day the dreamers die to see what's on the other side
She is liberty, and she comes to rescue me
Hope, faith, her vanity
The greatest gift is gold

Sleep comes like a drug in God's country
Sad eyes, crooked crosses, in God's country

Naked flame, she stands with a naked flame
I stand with the sons of Cain
Burned by the fire of love
Burned by the fire of love



You're leaving now
It's in your eyes
There's no disguising it
It really comes as no surprise
To find that you'd planned it all along

I see it now
It comes so clear
Your insincerity
And me all starry eyed
You think that I would have known by now

Now, sure as the sun will cross the sky
This lie is over
Lost, like the tears that used to tide me over

(Only time will tell)
One thing is sure
That time will tell
(Only time will tell)
If you were wrong
The brightest ring around the moon
Will darken when I die
Now, sure as the sun will cross the sky
The lying's over
Gone, like the tears that used to tide me over

You're leaving now
It's in your eyes
There's no disguising it
It really comes as no surprise
To find that you'd planned it all along

(Only time will tell)
I see it now (Only time will tell)
It comes so clear
Your insincerity
And me all starry-eyed
You think that I would have known by now

Now, sure as the sun will cross the sky
This lie is over
Lost, like the tears that used to tide me over
Over
Over
Over
(Only time will tell)
You're on your own (Only time will tell)
Inside your room
You're claiming victory
You were just using me
And there is no one you can use now
(Only time will tell)



Fame, (fame) makes a man take things over

Got to get a rain check on... pain (pain)

What's your name?
(Feeling so gay, feeling gay)



I am the one who can please you
Ain't that what you said
You seemed so alone
I guess I was easily led
I showed you my love and babe
I guess it went to your head
When you were hungry, I brought you breakfast in bed
Come on, even it up, even it up, even it up
Come on, even it up, even it up, even it up
Well, a good man pays his debt
But you ain't paid yours yet
Even it
It's time to even it, even it up
Well, I took you over the tracks when you wanted some sin
I brought you satin and herbs from the places I've been
Well, now something tells me, baby
You're going to use me again
You think you can lay down the how and the where and the when
Oh, you think you can
You better even it up, even it up, even it up right now
Oh well, even it up, even it up, even it up
I don't want to bum it all
No, but this ax, she's got to fall
Even it
Come on and even it, even it up, baby
Oh
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Come on now!
(Guitar solo)
Even it up, even it up, even it up
Even it up, even it up, even it up
Yeah, even it
Even it, even it, come on
Even it up, even it up, even it up, yeah.  Whoo!
Even it up, even it up, even it up
Oh, got your hand!
(Instrumental break)
Even it up, even it up, even it up



Hold life, I'm gonna live it up
I'm takin' flight, I said I'll never give it up
Stand tall, I'm the only kind and proud
I'm on the top as long as the music's loud
If you think I'll sit around as the world goes by
You're thinking like a fool 'cause it's a case of do or die
Out there is a fortune waiting to be had
You think I'll let it go, you're mad
You've got another thing comin'
You've got another thing comin'
That's right, here's where the talking ends
Well, listen this night there'll be some action spent
Drive hard, calling all the shots
I've got an ace card coming down on the rocks
If you think I'll sit around while they chip away my brain
Listen, I ain't fooling and you'd better think again
Out there is a fortune waiting to be had
You think I'll let it go, you're mad
You've got another thing comin'
You've got another thing comin'
You've got another thing comin'
In this world we're living in
We have our share of sorrows
Answer now is don't give in
Aim for a new tomorrow
Oh so hot, no time to take a rest yet
Act tough, ain't room for second best
Real strong, got me some security
Hey, I'm a big smash, I'm going for infinity, yeah
If you think I'll sit around as the world goes by
You're thinking like a fool 'cause it's a case of do or die
Out there is a fortune waiting to be had
You think I'll let it go, you're mad
You've got another thing comin'
You've got another thing comin'
You've got another thing comin'
You've got another thing
Comin' at you
You've got another thing comin', babe, it's a comin' up
You've got another thing comin', it's a comin down
You've got another thing comin'
You've got another thing comin'
You've got another thing comin', it's comin', it's a-comin'
You've got another thing comin', it's comin' off
You've got another thing comin', eh yeah, eh yeah
You've got another thing comin', baby
You've got another thing comin', you got another thing comin'
You've got another thing comin'



As you brush your shoes, stand before the mirror
And you comb your hair, grab your coat and hat
And you walk wet streets, tryin' to remember
All the wild night breezes in your mem'ry ever

And everything looks so complete
When you're walkin' out on the street
And the wind catches your feet
Sends you flyin', cryin'
Ooo-woo-wee, wild night is calling
Ooo-ooh-wee, wild night is calling

All the girls walk by, dressed up for each other
And the boys do the boogie-woogie on the corner of the street
And the people passin' by stare in wild wonder
And the inside jukebox roars out just like thunder

And everything looks so complete
When you're walkin' out on the street
And the wind catches your feet
Sends you flyin', cryin'
Ooo-woo-wee, wild night is calling
Ooo-ooh-wee, wild night is calling
The wild night is calling
The wild night is calling
Come on out and dance
Whoa, come on out and make romance
Come on out and dance
Come on out, make romance



Very superstitious....Writing on the wall
Very superstitious....Ladder's 'bout to fall
Thirteen month old baby....Broke that looking glass
Seven years of bad luck....Good things in the past
When you believe in things that you don't understand
Then you suffer....Superstition ain't the way
Very superstitious....Wash your face and hands
Rid me of the problem....Get all that you can
Keep me in a daydream....Keep me going strong
You don't want to save me....Sad is my song
When you believe in things that you don't understand
Then you suffer....Superstition ain't the way
Very superstitious....Nothing more to say
Very superstitious....Devil's on his way
Thirteen month old baby....Broke that looking glass
Seven years of bad luck....Good things in the past
When you believe in things that you don't understand
You will suffer....Superstition ain't the way



Instrumental Intro
Baby, do you understand me now
Sometimes I feel a little mad
But don't you know that no one alive
Can always be an angel
When things go wrong I seem to be bad
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
Baby, sometimes I'm so carefree
With a joy that's hard to hide
And sometimes it seems that all I have do is worry
And then you're bound to see my other side
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
If I seem edgy I want you to know
That I never mean to take it out on you
Life has its problems and I get my share
And that's one thing I never meant to do
Because I love you, oh
Oh, oh baby don't you know I'm human
Have thoughts like any other one
Sometimes I find myself long regretting
Some foolish thing some little simple thing I've done
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
Yes, I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
Yes, I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
Yes, I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood



Don't you know that I was sittin' back in Texas
I was playing those rhythm and blues
And then I got a big offer
For more money than I could refuse
I had the chance to make it
Playing anything I wanted to play
But way back in my mind
You know I could hear the people say
Keep playing that rock and roll
Keep doing what you been told
Save your money up for when you get old
Got to keep playing that rock and roll
So I packed up and I made it up to New York
Where my brother was a great big star
Yeah he was doing funky music
Singing and playing guitar
Johnny was making the big time
Everything was going his way
But way back in my mind
You know I could hear the people say
Keep playing that rock and roll
Keep doing what you been told
Save your money up for when you get old
Got to keep playing that rock and roll
Don't you know that I've been doing lots of thinking
I'vе been trying hard to figure it out
But there's a cеrtain kind of music, yeah
Got to make you jump and shout
Now you could call it commercial
If you want to be that way
But way back in my mind
You know I could hear the people say
Keep playing that rock and roll
Keep doing what you been told
Save your money up for when you get old
Got to keep playing that rock and roll
Oh you got to keep on playing
(You got to keep on playing)
Oh you got to keep on playing
(You got to keep on playing)
Oh you got to keep on playing
(You got to keep on playing)
Got to keep playing that rock and roll
Keep playing that rock and roll
Keep doing what you been told
Save your money up for when you get old
Got to keep playing that rock and roll
Rock and roll
Rock and roll
To satisfy my soul



Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?

He went out tiger hunting with his elephant and gun
In case of accidents, he always took his mum
He's the all American, bullet-headed, Saxon mother's son
All the children sing

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?

Deep in the jungle, where the mighty tiger lies
Bill and his elephants were taken by surprise
So Captain Marvel zapped him right between the eyes
All the children sing

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
The children asked him if to kill was not a sin
"Not when he looked so fierce," his mummy butted in
"If looks could kill, it would have been us instead of him"
All the children sing

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?

Eh, up!



It's another lonely evening
In another lonely town
But I ain’t too young to worry
And I ain’t too old to cry
When a woman gets me down
Got another empty bottle
And another empty bed
Ain’t too young to admit it
And I'm not too old to lie
I'm just another empty head

That's why I'm lonely
I'm so lonely
But I know what I'm going to do...

I'm gonna ride on
Ride on
(Ride on) Standing on the edge of the road
(Ride on) Thumb in the air
(Ride on) One of these days I'm gonna change my evil ways
Till then I'll just keep riding on

Broke another promise
And I broke another heart
But I ain’t too young to realize
That I ain’t too old to try
Try to get back to the start
And it's another red-light nightmare
Woah, an' another red-light street
And I ain’t too old to hurry
Cause I ain’t too old to die
But I sure am hard to beat

But I'm lonely
Lord I'm lonely
What am I gonna do?

I'm gonna ride on
Ride on
(Ride on) Got myself a one-way ticket
(Ride on) Goin' the wrong way
(Ride on) Gonna change my evil ways
... one of these days
One of these days...

I'm gonna ride on
Ride on
Ride on
Ride on, Lookin' for a truck
Ride on, Keep on riding
Ridin' on and on and on and on and on and on and on
Have myself a good time
Mmm, yeah
Ride, ride, ride
One of these days
One of these days...



You know, every now and then
I think you might like to hear something from us
Nice and easy but there's just one thing
You see, we never ever do nothing nice and easy
We always do it nice and rough
So we're going to take the beginning of this song
And do it easy
Then we're going to do the finish rough
This is the way we do 'Proud Mary'

Left a good job in the city
Working for the man every night and day
And I never lost one minute of sleeping
Worrying 'bout the way that things might have been

Big wheel keep on turning
Proud Mary keep on burning
And we're rolling, rolling
Rolling on the river
Listen to the story

Left a good job in the city
Working for the man every night and day
And I never lost one minute of sleeping
Worrying 'bout the way that things might have been
Big wheel keep on turning
Proud Mary keep on burning
And we're rolling, rolling
Rolling yeah
Rolling
Rolling on the river
Rolling on the river

Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis
Ya know I pumped a lot of 'tane down in New Orleans
But I never saw the good side of the city
Until I hitched a ride on the riverboat queen

Ya know the big wheel keep on turning
Proud Mary keep on burning
And we're rolling (Rolling)
Rolling yeah (Rolling)
Rolling on the river (Rolling on the river)
Said we're rolling (Rolling)
Rolling yeah (Rolling)
Rolling on the river (Rolling on the river)

Oh I left a good job in the city
Working for the man every night and day
And I never lost one minute of sleeping
Worrying 'bout the way that things might have been
Big wheel keep on turning (Turning)
Proud Mary keep on burning (Burning)
Rolling, rolling, rolling on the river
We're rolling, rolling, rolling on the river

We're up
Do do do do do do do do do do
Alright

Oh I cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis
And I pumped a lot of 'tane down in New Orleans
But I never saw the good side of the city
'Til I hitched a ride on the riverboat queen

Big wheel keep on turning (Turning)
Proud Mary keep on burning (Burning)
We're rolling, said we're rolling, we're rolling on the river
I'll tell ya we're rolling, rolling, rolling on the river

We're up
Do do do do do do do do do do
Alright

Ooo yeah yeah yeah yeah

If you come down to the river
I bet you going to find some people who live
And you don't have to worry if you got no money
People on the river are happy to give

Long ago, life was clean
Sex was bad, called obscene
And the rich were so mean
Stately homes for the Lords
Croquet lawns, village greens
Victoria was my queen

Victoria, Victoria
Victoria, 'toria

I was born, lucky me
In a land that I love
Though I'm poor, I am free
When I grow, I shall fight
For this land, I shall die
Let her sun never set

Victoria, Victoria
Victoria, 'toria
Victoria, Victoria
Victoria, 'toria
Land of hope and the gloria
Land of my Victoria
Land of hope and the gloria
Land of my Victoria
Victoria, 'toria

Victoria, Victoria
Victoria, 'toria

Canada to India
Australia to Cornwall
Singapore to Hong Kong
From the West to the East
From the rich to the poor
Victoria loved them all

Victoria, Victoria, Victoria, 'toria
Victoria, Victoria, Victoria



Now I've been happy lately
Thinkin' about the good things to come
And I believe it could be
Something good has begun

Oh, I've been smilin' lately
Dreamin' about the world as one
And I believe it could be
Some day it's going to come

Cause out on the edge of darkness
There rides a peace train
Oh, peace train take this country
Come take me home again

Now, I've been smiling lately
Thinkin' about the good things to come
And I believe it could be
Something good has begun

Oh, peace train soundin' louder
Glide on the peace train

Soon it will all be true

Oh, peace train soundin' louder
Glide on the peace train
Ooh, ah, ee, ah, ooh, ah
Come on, now peace train
Peace train

Thinkin' about the world as it is

Why can't we live in bliss?

Oh, peace train take this country
Come take me home again
Oh, peace train soundin' louder
Glide on the peace train

Well, show me the way
To the next whiskey bar
Oh, don't ask why
Oh, don't ask why
Show me the way
To the next whiskey bar
Oh, don't ask why
Oh, don't ask why
For if we don't find
The next whiskey bar
I tell you we must die
I tell you we must die

I tell you we must die

Oh, moon of Alabama
We now must say goodbye
We've lost our good old mama
And must have whiskey, oh, you know why
Oh, moon of Alabama

Well, we got no choice
All the girls and boys
Makin' all that noise
'Cause they found new toys
Well, we can't salute ya
Can't find a flag
If that don't suit ya, that's a drag

School's out for summer
School's out forever
School's been blown to pieces
No more pencils
No more books
No more teacher's dirty looks
Yeah!

Well, we got no class
And we got no principles
And we got no innocence
We can't even think
Of a word that rhymes

School's out for summer
School's out forever
My school's been blown to pieces
No more pencils
No more books
No more teacher's dirty looks
Out for summer
Out 'til fall
We might not come back at all

School's out forever
School's out for summer
School's out with fever
School's out completely



{Intro}
Walking through forests of palm tree apartments
Scoff at the monkeys who live in their dark tents
Down by the waterhole, drunk every Friday
Eating their nuts, saving their raisins for Sunday
Lions and tigers who wait in the shadows
They're fast but they're lazy, and sleep in green meadows
Well, let's bungle in the jungle
Well, that's all right by me, yeah
Well, I'm a tiger when I want love
But I'm a snake if we disagree
Just say a word and the boys will be right there
With claws at your back to send a chill through the night air
Is it so frightening to have me at your shoulder?
Thunder and lightning couldn't be bolder
I'll write on your tombstone, and thank you for dinner
This game that we animals play is a winner
Well, let's bungle in the jungle
Well, that's all right by me, yes
I'm a tiger when I want love
I'm a snake if we disagree, yes
{Bridge}
The rivers are full of crocodile nasties
And he who made kittens put snakes in their grasp
He's a lover of life but a player of pawns
Yes, the King on His sunset lies waiting for dawn
To light up His Jungle as play is resumed
The monkeys seem willing to strike up the tune
Well, let's bungle in the jungle
Well, that's all right by me, yes
I'm a tiger when I want love
And I'm a snake when we disagree, yes
Let's bungle in the jungle
Well, that's all right by me, yes
Well, I'm a tiger when I want love
And I'm a snake when we disagree



She broke down and let me in
Made me see where I'd been

Been down one time
Been down two times
I'm never going back again

You don't know what it means to win
Come 'round and see me again

Been down one time
Been down two times
I'm never going back again



When they come to take you down
When they bring that wagon 'round
When they come to call on you
And drag your poor body down
Just one thing I ask of you
Just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name
My darling, Sugaree
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
You thought you was the cool fool
And never would do no wrong
You had everything sewed up tight
How come you lay awake all night long
Just one thing I ask of you
Just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name
My darling, Sugaree
Well, in spite of all you gained
You still have to stand out in the pouring rain
One last voice is calling you
And I guess it's time you go
Just one thing I ask of you
Just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name
My darling, Sugaree
Well, shake it up now, Sugaree
I'll meet you at the jubilee
And if that jubilee don't come
Maybe I'll meet you on the run
Just one thing I ask of you
Just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name
My darling, Sugaree
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me



What kind of love have you got?
You should be home but you're not
A room full of noise and dangerous boys
Still make you thirsty and hot
I heard about you and that man
There's just one thing I don't understand
You say he's a liar and he put out your fire
How come you still got his gun in your hand?
Victim of love, I see a broken heart
You got your stories to tell
Victim of love, it's such an easy part
And you know how to play it so well
Some people never come clean
I think you know what I mean
You're walkin' the wire, pain and desire
Looking for love in between
Tell me your secrets, I'll tell you mine
This ain't no time to be cool
And tell all your girlfriends
Your "been around the world" friends
That talk is for losers and fools
Victim of love, I see a broken heart
I could be wrong, but I'm not, no I'm not
Victim of love, we're not so far apart
Show me, what kind of love have you got?
Victim of love, I see a broken heart
I could be wrong, but I'm not
Victim of love, we're not so far apart
What kind of love have you got?
Victim of love, you're just a victim of love
I could be wrong, but I'm not, no I'm not
Victim of love, now you're a victim of love
What kind of love have you got?
What kind of love have you got?
What kind of love have you got?



I don't know how I'm going to tell you
I can't play with you no more
I don't know how I'm gonna do what mama told me
My friend, the boy next door
I can't believe what people saying
You're gonna let your hair hang down
I'm satisfied to sit here working all day long
You're in the darker side of town

And when I'm out I see you walking
Why don't your eyes see me
Could it be you've found another game to play
What did mama say to me?

That's the way
Oh, that's the way it ought to be
Yeah, yeah, mama say
That's the way it ought to stay

And yesterday I saw you standing by the river
And weren't those tears that filled your eyes
And all the fish that lay in dirty water dying
Had they got you hypnotized?
And yesterday I saw you kissing tiny flowers
But all that lives is born to die
And so I say to you that nothing really matters
And all you do is stand and cry
I don't know what to say about it
When all you ears have turned away
But now's the time to look and look again at what you see
Is that the way it ought to stay?

That's the way
That's the way it ought-ta be
Oh, don't you know now, mama said
That's the way it's going to stay, yeah



*Pig snorts*

Big man, pig man
Haha, charade you are
Wooh!
You well-heeled big wheel
Haha, charade you are
And when your hand is on your heart
You're nearly a good laugh, almost a joker
With your head down in the pig bin
Sayin', "Keep on digging"
Pig stain on your fat chin
What do you hope to find
Down in the pig mine?

You're nearly a laugh
You're nearly a laugh, but you're really a cry

Bus stop rat bag
Haha, charade you are
You fucked up old hag
Haha, charade you are
You radiate cold shafts of broken glass
You're nearly a good laugh
Almost worth a quick grin
You like the feel of steel
You're hot stuff with a hatpin
And good fun with a handgun
You're nearly a laugh
You're nearly a laugh, but you're really a cry


Hey you, Whitehouse
Haha, charade you are
You house proud town mouse
Haha, charade you are
You're tryin' to keep our feelings off the street
You're nearly a real treat
All tight lips and cold feet
And do you feel abused?
Gotta stem the evil tide
And keep it all on the inside

Mary, you're nearly a treat
Mary, you're nearly a treat, but you're really a cry



You know sometimes, I don't know why
But this old town just seems so hopeless
I ain't really sure, but it seems I remember the good times
Were just a little bit more in focus
But when she puts her arms around me
I can somehow rise above it
Yeah, man, when I got that little girl standin' right by my side
You know, I can tell the whole wide world to shove it, hey!

Here comes my girl
Here comes my girl
Yeah, and she looks so right
She is all I need tonight

Every now and then I get down to the end of the day
I have to stop and ask myself why I've done it
It just seems so useless to have to work so hard
And nothin' ever really seems to come from it
And then she looks me in the eye and says, "We're gonna last forever"
And man, you know I can't begin to doubt it
No, 'cause it just feels so good, and so free, and so right
I know we ain't never gonna change our minds about it, hey!
Here comes my girl
Here comes my girl
Yeah, and she looks so right
She is all I need tonight

Watch her walk

Every time it seems like there ain't nothin' left no more
I find myself having to reach out and grab hold of something
Yeah, I just catch myself wondering, waiting, and worrying
About some silly little things that don't add up to nothin'
And then she looks me in the eye and says, "We're gonna last forever"
And man, you know I can't begin to doubt it
No, 'cause it just feels so good, and so free, and so right
I know we ain't never gonna change our minds about it, hey!

Here comes my girl
Here comes my girl
Yeah, and she looks so right
She is all I need tonight

That's right
That's right
Oh!



Well, he was cold, tired and hungry

The lady took him in
And fed him breakfast in bed

It wasn't me
No, no, baby, it wasn't me

At an Alpha Kappa dance

Well, you've got your diamonds
And you've got your pretty clothes
And the chauffeur drives your car
You let everybody know

But don't play with me
'Cause you're playing with fire

Your mother she's an heiress
Owns a block in Saint John's Wood
And your father'd be there with her
If he only could

But don't play with me
'Cause you're playing with fire

Your old man took her diamonds
And tiaras by the score
Now she gets her kicks in Stepney
Not in Knightsbridge anymore
So don't play with me
'Cause you're playing with fire

Now you've got some diamonds
And you will have some others
But you'd better watch your step, girl
Or start living with your mother

So don't play with me
'Cause you're playing with fire
So don't play with me
'Cause you're playing with fire



If you want it, here it is come and get it
Mm-mm-mm-mm, make your mind up fast
If you want it, anytime I can give it
But you better hurry 'cause it may not last
Did I hear you say that there must be a catch?
Will you walk away from a fool and his money?
If you want it, here it is come and get it
But you better hurry 'cause it's going fast
If you want it, here it is come and get it
Mm-mm-mm-mm, make your mind up fast

You'd better hurry 'cause it's going fast
Ooh-ooh-ooh, fool and his money

But you better hurry 'cause it's going fast
You'd better hurry 'cause it's going fast
You'd better hurry 'cause it's going fast



There's a woman that you ought to know
And she's coming, singing soft and low
Singing rock n' roll, she's a joy to know
'Neath the shadow of a soothing hand
I am free there just to make my plans
Dream of faraway lands, anything close at hand
And she will follow me wide, do you know
Familiar places she's been by, that I know
Could it be, she don't have to try
And tomorrow, she's a friend of mine
And the sorrow, I see her face is lined
She's no longer blind, she's just hard to find



Be on my side, I'll be on your side, baby
There is no reason for you to hide
It's so hard for me staying here all alone
When you could be taking me for a ride

(Ooh la la lah la la lala) Yeah
(Ooh la la lah la la lala) She could drag me over the rainbow
(Ooh la la lah la la lala) And send me away

Down by the river
I shot my baby
Down by the river

Dead, ooh
Shot her dead, ooh


You take my hand, I'll take your hand
Together we may get away
This much madness is too much sorrow
It's impossible to make it today
(Ooh la la lah la la lala) Yeah, ooh, yeah
(Ooh la la lah la la lala) She could drag me over the rainbow
(Ooh la la lah la la lala) And send me away, yeah

Dead, dead, ooh
Ooh, shot her dead
Shot her dead


Be on my side, I'll be on your side

It's so hard for me staying here all alone
When you could be taking me for a ride

(Ooh la la lah la la lala) Ooh, yeah
(Ooh la la lah la la lala) She could drag me over the rainbow
(Ooh la la lah la la lala) And send me away, yeah
Down by the river

Down by the river



Every single day, I got a heartache comin' my way
I don't wanna say goodbye
Baby but look at the tears in my eye
I don't wanna say goodbye
Mama but look at the way you made me cry
Every way that's nice
You show you've got a heart that's made of ice
And I know
Fire and water must have made you their daughter
You've got what it takes, to make a poor man's heart break
A poor mans heart break
Baby you turn me on
But as quick as a flash your love is gone
Baby I'm gonna leave you now
But I'm gonna try to make you grieve somehow
Fire and water must have made you their daughter
You've got what it takes to make a poor man's heart break
A poor man's heart break
And my heart is breakin' too
(ahh yeah)
(alright)
I don't wanna say goodbye baby
But look at the tears you made me cry
Every way that's nice
You show you've got a heart that's made of ice
And I know
Fire and water must have made you their daughter
You've got what it takes to make a poor mans heart break
Fire, fire and water must have made you their daughter
Baby you've got what it takes to make a poor man's heart break
Heart break
Baby and my heart is breakin'
Ohh my heart is breakin'
Ohh listen



Cry baby, cry baby, cry baby
Honey, welcome back home

I know she told you
Honey I know she told you that she loved you
Much more than I did
But all I know is that she left you
And you swear that you just don't know why
But you know, honey I'll always
I'll always be around if you ever want me

Cry baby, cry baby, cry baby
Honey, welcome back home

Don't you know, honey
Ain't nobody ever going to love you
The way I try to do?
Who'll take all your pain
Honey, your heartache, too?
And if you need me, you know
That I'll always be around if you ever want me
Cry baby, cry baby, cry baby
Honey, welcome back home

And when you walk around the world, babe
You said you'd try to look for the end of the road
You might find out later that the road will end in Detroit
Honey, the road will even end in Kathmandu
You can go all around the world
Trying to find something to do with your life, baby
When you only got to do one thing well
You only got to do one thing well to make it in this world, babe
You got a woman waiting for you there
All you ever got to do is be a good man one time to one woman
And that will be the end of the road, babe
I know you got more tears to share, babe

Cry baby, cry baby, cry baby
Honey, welcome back home

And if you ever feel a little lonely, dear
I want you to come on, come on to your mama now
And if you ever want a little love of a woman
Cry baby, cry baby, cry baby
Honey, welcome back home



It is the springtime of my loving
The second season I am to know
You are the sunlight in my growing
So little warmth I've felt before
It isn't hard to feel me glowing
I watched the fire that grew so low, oooh, oh


It is the summer of my smiles
Flee from me, keepers of the gloom
Speak to me only with your eyes
It is to you I give this tune
Ain't so hard to recognize, oh
These things are clear to all from time to time, ooh
Oh, oh

Ah, talk, talk, talk, talk
Hey!
I've felt the coldness of my winter
I never thought it would ever go
I cursed the gloom that set upon us, upon us, upon us
But I know that I love you so, ohhhh, oh
But I know that I love you so
These are the seasons of emotion
And like the winds they rise and fall
This is the wonder of devotion
I see the torch we all must hold
This is the mystery of the quotient quotient
Ah, upon us all, upon us all a little rain must fall
Just a little rain, oh yeah
Uhh, ooooh, yeah yeah yeah



Well, all right so I'm being foolish
Well, all right let people know
About the dreams and wishes you wish
In the night when the lights are low
Well, all right, well all right
We'll live and love with all our might
Well, all right, well all right
Our lifetime love will be all right
Well, all right, so I'm going steady
It's all right when people say
That those foolish kids can't be ready
For the love that comes their way
Well, all right, well all right
We'll live and love with all our might
Well, all right, well all right
Our lifetime love will be all right
Well, all right, well all right
We'll live and love with all our might
Well, all right, well all right
Our lifetime love will be all right



Yesterday a morning came, a smile upon your face
Caesar's Palace, morning glory, silly human race
On a sailing ship to nowhere, leaving any place
If the summer changed to winter, yours is no disgrace
Battleships confide in me and tell me where you are
Shining, flying, purple wolfhound, show me where you are
Lost in summer, born in winter, travel very far
Lost in losing circumstances, that's just where you are
Yesterday a morning came, a smile upon your face
Caesar's Palace, morning glory, silly human, silly human race
On a sailing ship to nowhere, leaving any place
If the summer changed to winter, yours is no, yours is no disgrace
Yours is no disgrace
Yours is no disgrace
Death defying, mutilated armies gather near
Crawling out of dirty holes, their morals, their morals disappear
Yesterday a morning came, a smile upon your face
Caesar's Palace, morning glory, silly human, silly human, silly human race
On a sailing ship to nowhere, leaving any place
If the summer changed to winter, yours is no, yours is no disgrace
Yours is no disgrace
Yours is no disgrace
Battleships confide in me and tell me where you are
Shining, flying, purple wolfhound, show me where you are
Lost in summer, born in winter, travel very far
Lost in losing circumstances, that's just where you are



Look at us baby, up all night
Tearing our love apart
Aren't we the same two people who live
Through years in the dark? Ah ahh

Every time I try to walk away
Something makes me turn around and stay

And I can't tell you why

When we get crazy, it just ain't right
(Try to keep your head, little girl)
Girl, I get lonely, too
You don't have to worry, just hold on tight
(Don't get caught in your little world)
Cause I love you

Nothing's wrong as far as I can see
We make it harder than it has to be

And I can't tell you why
No, baby, I can't tell you why
I can't tell you why

Every time I try to walk away
Something makes me turn around and stay

And I can't tell you why
No, no baby, I can't tell you why
I can't tell you why
I can't tell you why



Go away from my window
Leave at your own chosen speed
I’m not the one you want, babe
I’m not the one you need
You say you're looking for someone
Who's never weak but always strong
To protect you and defend you
Whether you are right or wrong
Someone to open each and every door

But it ain't me, babe
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
It ain't me you’re looking for, babe

Go lightly from the ledge, babe
Go lightly on the ground
I’m not the one you want, babe
I will only let you down
You say you're looking for someone
Who will promise never to part
Someone to close his eyes for you
Someone to close his heart
Someone who will die for you and more
But it ain't me, babe
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
It ain't me you’re looking for, babe

Go melt back in the night
Everything inside is made of stone
There's nothing in here moving
And anyway I'm not alone
You say you're lookin' for someone
Who'll pick you up each time you fall
To gather flowers constantly
And to come each time you call
A lover for your life and nothing more

But it ain't me, babe
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
It ain't me you’re looking for, babe



I've just seen a face I can't forget the time or place
Where we just met, she's just the girl for me
And I want all the world to see we've met
Mmm-mmm-mmm-m'mmm-mmm

Had it been another day I might have looked the other way
And I'd have never been aware
But as it is I'll dream of her tonight
Di-di-di-di'n'di

Fallin', yes I am fallin'
And she keeps callin' me back again

I have never known the like of this I've been alone
And I have missed things and kept out of sight
But other girls were never quite like this
Da-da-n'da-da'n'da

Fallin', yes I am fallin'
And she keeps callin' me back again

Fallin', yes I am fallin'
And she keeps callin' me back again

I've just seen a face I can't forget the time or place
Where we just met, she's just the girl for me
And I want all the world to see we've met
Mmm-mmm-mmm-da-da-da

Fallin', yes I am fallin'
And she keeps callin' me back again
Fallin', yes I am fallin'
And she keeps callin' me back again

Oh, fallin', yes I am fallin'
And she keeps callin' me back again



I've been run down
I've been lied to
I don't know why
I let that mean woman make me a fool
She took all my money
Wrecked my new car
Now she's with one of my good time buddies
They're drinking in some crosstown bar

Sometimes I feel
Sometimes I feel
Like I've been tied
To the whipping post
Tied to the whipping post
Tied to the whipping post
Good Lord, I feel like I'm dying


My friends tell me
That I've been such a fool
And I have to stand by and take it, babe
All for loving you
I drown myself in sorrow
As I look at what you've done
But nothing seems to change
The bad times stay the same
And I can't run
Sometimes I feel
Sometimes I feel
Like I've been tied
To the whipping post
Tied to the whipping post
Tied to the whipping post
Good Lord, I feel like I'm dying


Sometimes I feel
Sometimes I feel
Like I've been tied
To the whipping post
Tied to the whipping post
Tied to the whipping post
Good Lord, I feel like I'm dying



Takin’ off

I was told a million times of all the troubles in my way
Mind you grow a little wiser, little better every day
But if I crossed a million rivers and I rode a million miles
Then I'd still be where I started, bread and butter for a smile
Well I sold a million mirrors in a shop in Alley Way
But I never saw my face in any window any day
Now they say your folks are telling you, "Be a superstar"
But I tell you, just be satisfied and stay right where you are
Keep yourself alive (Yeah), keep yourself alive
Take you all your time and-a money, honey, you'll survive
Well, I've loved a million women in a belladonic haze
And I ate a million dinners brought to me on silver trays
Give me everything I need to feed my body and my soul
And I'll grow a little bigger, maybe that can be my goal
I was told a million times of all the people in my way
How I had to keep on trying and get better every day
But if I crossed a million rivers and I rode a million miles
Then I'd still be where I started, same as when I started
Keep yourself alive (Come on), keep yourself alive
Take you all your time and-a money, honey, you'll survive (Shake)

(Ow!)

Keep yourself alive (Whoa), keep yourself alive
Oh, take you all your time and-a money to keep me satisfied

Do you think you're better every day?
No, I just think I'm two steps nearer to my grave

Keep yourself alive (Come on), keep yourself alive
You take your time and take my money, keep yourself alive

Keep yourself alive (Come on), keep yourself alive
All you people, keep yourself alive

Keep yourself alive (Come on, come on), keep yourself alive
Take you all your time and-a money to keep me satisfied
Keep yourself alive, keep yourself alive
All you people, keep yourself alive

Take you all your time and money, honey, you will survive
Keep you satisfied, keep yourself alive



I've been working real hard, trying to get my hands clean
We'll drive that dusty road from Monroe to Angeline
To buy you a gold and a pretty dress of blue
Baby, just one kiss will get these things for you
A kiss to seal our fate tonight
A kiss to

Prove it all night, prove it all night
Girl, there's nothing else that we can do
Said prove it all night, prove it all night
And, girl, I'll prove it all night for you

Everybody's got a hunger, a hunger they can't resist
There's so much that you want, you deserve much more than this
But if dreams came true, oh, wouldn't that be nice
But this ain't no dream we're living out through the night
And, girl, you want it, you take it, you pay the price to

Prove it all night, prove it all night
Prove it all night girl and call the bluff
We prove it all night, prove it all night
Girl, I prove it all night for your love
Baby, tie your hair back in a long white bow
Meet me in the fields behind the dynamo
You hear their voices telling you not to go
They made their choices and they'll never know
What it means to steal, to cheat, to lie
What it's like to live and die to

Prove it all night, prove it all night
There is nothing else that we can do
Say prove it all night, prove it all night
And, girl, I prove it all night for you

I prove it all night, I prove it all night
I prove it all night, I prove it all night
I prove it all night, I prove it all night
I prove it all night, I prove it all night



Then, as it was, then again it will be
And though the course may change sometimes
Rivers always reach the sea
Flying skies of fortune, each a separate way
On the wings of maybe, downing birds of prey
Kind of makes me feel sometimes, didn’t have to go
But as the eagle leaves the nest, got so far to go

Changes fill my time, baby, that's alright with me
In the midst I think of you, and how it used to be


Did you ever really need somebody
And really need 'em bad?
Did you ever really want somebody
The best love you ever had?
Do you ever remember me, baby?
Did it feel so good?
Cause it was just the first time
And you knew you would

Through the eyes and I sparkle, senses growing keen
Taste your love along the way, see your feathers preen
Kind of makes me feel sometimes, didn't have to grow
We are eagles of one nest, the nest is in our soul
Vixen in my dreams, with great surprise to me
Never thought I'd see your face the way it used to be
Oh darling, oh darling
Oh, oh darling, oh yeah, oh darling

I'm never going to leave you
I'm never going to leave
Holding on, ten years gone
Ten years gone, holding on, ten years gone
I'm never, I'm never
Oooh, yeah...



It's nine o'clock on a Saturday
The regular crowd shuffles in
There's an old man sittin' next to me
Makin' love to his tonic and gin
He says, "Son, can you play me a memory?
I'm not really sure how it goes
But it's sad, and it's sweet, and I knew it complete
When I wore a younger man's clothes"
La, la-la, di-dee-da
La-la, di-dee-da, da-dum

Sing us a song, you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
And you've got us feeling alright

Now John at the bar is a friend of mine
He gets me my drinks for free
And he's quick with a joke, or to light up your smoke
But there's someplace that he'd rather be
He says, "Bill, I believe this is killing me"
As the smile ran away from his face
"Well I'm sure that I could be a movie star
If I could get out of this place"
Oh, la, la-la, di-dee-da
La-la, di-dee-da, da-dum

Now Paul is a real estate novelist
Who never had time for a wife
And he's talkin' with Davy, who's still in the Navy
And probably will be for life
And the waitress is practicing politics
As the businessmen slowly get stoned
Yes, they're sharing a drink they call loneliness
But it's better than drinkin' alone


Sing us a song, you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
And you've got us feeling alright

It's a pretty good crowd for a Saturday
And the manager gives me a smile
'Cause he knows that it's me they've been comin' to see
To forget about life for a while
And the piano, it sounds like a carnival
And the microphone smells like a beer
And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar
And say, "Man, what are you doin' here?"
Oh, la, la-la, di-dee-da
La-la, di-dee-da, da-dum

Sing us a song, you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
And you've got us feeling alright



Well, I'm standing here freezing
Inside your golden garden
I got my ladder leaned
Up against your wall
Tonight's the night we planned
To run away together
Come on Dolly Mae, there's no time to stall
But now you're telling me...

I think we better wait till tomorrow
Yeah, yeah, hey
(I think we better wait till tomorrow)
Girl, what you're talking 'bout?
(I think we better wait till tomorrow)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Gotta make sure it's right
So until tomorrow, goodnight
Oh, what a drag
Oh, Dolly Mae, how can you
Hang me up this way?
On the phone you said you wanted
To run off with me today
Now I'm standing here
Like some turned-down serenading fool
Hearing strange words stutter
From the mixed-up mind of you
And you keep telling me, that, uh...
I think we better wait till tomorrow
What you're talking 'bout?
(I think we better wait till tomorrow)
No, can't wait that long
(I think we better wait 'til tomorrow)
Oh, no
Gotta make sure it's right
Until tomorrow, goodnight, oh no
See if I can talk to this girl a little bit here
Oh, Dolly Mae girl, you must be insane
So unsure of yourself leaning
From your unsure window pane
Do I see a silhouette of somebody
Pointing something from a tree?
Click, bang!
What a hang
Your daddy just shot poor me
And I hear you say, as I fade away...

We don't have to wait till tomorrow, hey!
We don't have to wait till tomorrow
What'd you say?
(We don't have to wait till tomorrow)
It must not have been right
So forever, goodnight
Listen at you
(We don't have to wait till tomorrow)
Ah, do I have to wait? Don't have to wait
(We don't have to wait till tomorrow)
It's a drag on my part
(We don't have to wait till tomorrow)
Don't have to wait, uh, hmm, oh no
(We don't have to wait till tomorrow)
Don't have to wait, don't have to wait, yeah
(We don't have to wait till tomorrow)
Don't have to wait, don't have to wait
(We don't have to wait till tomorrow)
Oh no, I won't be around tomorrow, yeah!
(We don't have to wait till tomorrow)
Don't have to wait
(We don't have to wait till tomorrow)
Bye, bye bye!
(We don't have to wait till tomorrow)
Oh, what a mix up
Crazy, ah!
We don't have to wait till tomorrow



(One, two, three, four!)
All I need is a TV show, that and the radio
Down on my luck again, down on my luck again
I can show you, I can show you some of the people in my life
I can show you, I can show you some of the people in my life
It's driving me mad, just another way of passing the day
I, I get so lonely when she's not there
I, I, I, I...
You're just another face that I know from the TV show
I have known you for so very long, I feel you like a friend
Can't you do anything for me, can I touch you for a while
Can I meet you another day and we will fly away
I can show you I can show you some of the people in my life
I can show you I can show you some of the people in my life
It's driving me mad it's just another way of passing the day
I, I get so lonely when she's not there
I, I, I...
Turn it on, turn it on, turn it on again
Turn it on, turn it on, turn it on again
Turn it on, turn it on, turn it on again (I can see another face)
Turn it on, turn it on, turn it on again (I can see another face)
Turn it on, turn it on, turn it on again (I can see another face)
Turn it on, turn it on, turn it on again (I can see another face)
Turn it on, turn it on, turn it on again (I can see another face)
Turn it on, turn it on, turn it on again (I can see another face)



Do you remember
Back in nineteen sixty six?
Country Jesus, Hillbilly blues
That's where I learned my licks
Oh, from coast to coast and line to line
In every county there
I'm talking about that outlaw X
It's cutting through the air
Anywhere, ya'll
Everywhere, ya'll
I heard it, I heard it
I heard it on the X
We can all thank doctor B
Who stepped across the line
With lots of watts he took control
The first one of its kind
So listen to your radio
Most each and every night
Cause if you don't
It sure you won't get to feeling right
Anywhere, ya'll
Everywhere, ya'll
I heard it, I heard it
I heard it on the X



I should have quit you, a long time ago
Ohh, yeahhh, long time ago
I wouldn't be here, my children
Down on this killing floor

I should have listened, baby, to my second mind
Oh, I should have listened, baby, to my second mind
Everytime I go away and leave you, darling
You send me the blues way down the line


Baby, yeah
Give it to me, baby
My, my, my
Take it down a bit
Give it to me, baby
Keep me satisfied
Tryin' worry bout me, baby but I'd never get you with myself
Keep on worrying, baby
Can't keep you satisfied
Huh, let me tell you, baby
You ain't nothing but a two-bit no good jive
I went to sleep last night, I worked as hard as I can
I bring home my money
You take my money
Give it to another man
I should have quit you, baby
Oh, such a long time ago, oh
I wouldn't be here with all my troubles
Down on this killing floor

Squeeze me baby, till the juice runs down my leg
Squeeze me baby, till the juice runs down my leg
The way you squeeze my lemon, ah
I'm gonna fall right out of bed
Bed, bed, bed, yeah

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, oh


I'm going to leave my children down on this killing floor



I'm looking through you, where did you go?
I thought I knew you, what did I know?
You don't look different, but you have changed
I'm looking through you, you're not the same

Your lips are moving, I cannot hear
Your voice is soothing, but the words aren't clear
You don't sound different, I've learned the game
I'm looking through you, you're not the same

Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight

You're thinking of me, the same old way
You were above me, but not today
The only difference is you're down there
I'm looking through you, and you're nowhere

Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight
I'm looking through you, where did you go?
I thought I knew you, what did I know?
You don't look different, but you have changed
I'm looking through you, you're not the same

Yeah, oh, baby, you've changed
Ah, I'm looking through you
Yeah, I'm looking through you
You changed, you changed, you changed, you changed



It's a hard world to get a break in
All the good things have been taken
But girl there are ways
To make certain things pay
Though I'm dressed in these rags
I'll wear sable
Someday
Hear what I say
I'm gonna ride the serpent
No more time spent
Sweatin' rent
Hear my command
I'm breakin' loose
It ain't no use
Holdin' me down
Stick around

But baby, baby
Remember, remember
It's my life and I'll do what I want
It's my mind and I'll think what I want
Show me I'm wrong, hurt me sometime
But, some day, I'll treat you real fine
There'll be women and their fortunes
Who just want to mother orphans
Are you gonna cry
When I'm squeezing them dry?
Taking all I can get
No regrets

When I
Openly lie (ha)
And live on their money
Believe me honey
That money
Can you believe?
I ain't no Saint
No complaints
So girl throw out
Any doubt

And baby, baby
Remember, remember
It's my life and I'll do what I want
It's my mind and I'll think what I want
Show me I'm wrong, hurt me sometime
But some day, I'll treat you real fine
(It's my life and I'll do what I want)
Don't push me
(It's my mind and I'll think what I want)
It's my life
(It's my life and I'll do what I want)
And I can do what I want
(It's my mind and I'll think what I want)
You can't tell me
(It's my life and I'll do what I want)
I'm gonna do what I want
(It's my mind and I'll think what I want)



Homie I'm the hardest, get knocked out like two dilaudids
Always finish what I started, but I dont know what ill call it
Im the most important thing like breakfast in the morning
Tell your boy hes too annoying and also hes to flamboyant
I tell em how it is, how im to violent for the radio
Ive seen yall sing along your boy got that contagious flow
Or is it the lyrics that pull you into the danger show
Take your kicks and rock em in front of ya thats the way it goes
Come over here wylin I make your nose trickle
Hit him three times with the slugger, yeah get a triple
Threw him in the ocean, wait for no more ripples
Then word is nipples I go and make his girl crippled, uh
Im too raw for these bitches, butcher shop
Oh you can't find me? damn you should look on top
I will take your drugs and money, let you go, crooked cop
Show up while your eating dinner, see if youll be shook or not
They wanna know about me, whats my bio
Kashmire, one who gets messy like a gyro
A soldier on the beat bitch, look up a tyro
Im a pyro, spittin fire like Spyro
Words so hot when I spit I cause I drought
Got a switch blade that they dont allow in boy scouts
Plus the .45 its got a power spout
Got him in the foot he walkin funny like he got the gout
Who said that ill change? mother fucker im the same
Just a little more deranged, brain numb no cocaine
I do this for the game, thank god im not lame
Follow Fleetwood Mac because ill never break the chain
Dont make me have to pop off like opening champagne
Bitch I bring the damn pain, the fame is what ill gain
The beast you cannot tame, this man is too insane
Ill give you an uppercut, go threw you, and then grab your brain
FATALITY



You got me running, going out of my mind
You got me thinking that I'm wasting my time

Don't bring me down
No, no, no, no, no
Ooh-ooh-hoo
I'll tell you once more before I get off the floor
Don't bring me down

You wanna stay out with your fancy friends

Ooh-ooh-hoo
I'll tell you once more before I get off the floor
Don't bring me down

Don't bring me down, Groos
Don't bring me down, Groos
Don't bring me down, Groos
Don't bring me down
What happened to the girl I used to know?
You let your mind out somewhere down the road

Don't bring me down
No, no, no, no, no
Ooh-ooh-hoo
I'll tell you once more before I get off the floor
Don't bring me down

You're always talking 'bout your crazy nights
One of these days, you're gonna get it right

Don't bring me down
No, no, no, no, no
Ooh-ooh-hoo
I'll tell you once more before I get off the floor
Don't bring me down

Don't bring me down, Groos
Don't bring me down, Groos

You're looking good, just like a snake in the grass
One of these days, you're gonna break your glass

Don't bring me down
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Ooh-ooh-hoo
I'll tell you once more before I get off the floor
Don't bring me down

You got me shaking, got me running away
You got me crawling up to you everyday

Don't bring me down
No, no, no, no, no
Ooh-ooh-hoo
I'll tell you once more before I get off the floor
Don't bring me down, down, down, down, down, down

I'll tell you once more before I get off the floor
Don't bring me down



And the sign said "Long-haired freaky people
Need not apply"
So I tucked my hair up under my hat
And I went in to ask him why
He said "You look like a fine upstanding young man
I think you'll do"
So I took off my hat, I said "Imagine that
Huh! Me workin' for you!"
Whoa-oh-oh

Sign, sign, everywhere a sign
Blockin' out the scenery
Breakin' my mind
Do this, don't do that
Can't you read the sign?

And the sign said anybody caught trespassing
Would be shot on sight
So I jumped on the fence and I yelled at the house
"Hey! What gives you the right?
To put up a fence to keep me out
Or to keep Mother Nature in
If God was here he'd tell you to your face
Man, you're some kinda sinner"
Sign, sign, everywhere a sign
Blockin' out the scenery
Breakin' my mind
Do this, don't do that
Can't you read the sign?
{In album version only}

Now, hey you, mister, can't you read?
You've got to have a shirt and tie to get a seat
You can't even watch, no, you can't eat
You ain't supposed to be here
The sign said you got to have a membership card to get inside
Ugh!

And the sign said, "Everybody welcome. Come in, kneel down and pray"
But when they passed around the plate at the end of it all, I didn't have a penny to pay
So I got me a pen and a paper and I made up my own little sign
I said, "Thank you, Lord, for thinkin' 'bout me. I'm alive and doin' fine."
Wooo!

Sign, sign, everywhere a sign
Blockin' out the scenery, breakin' my mind
Do this, don't do that, can't you read the sign?
{Outro}
Sign, sign, everywhere a sign
Sign
Sign, sign



Stage banter on Deluxe Edition only

Uh... we'd like to carry on now, and play a song originally recorded by Mose Allison, who's really a jazz musician, and I did read something on one of his record covers which said he was a "jazz sage." And, uh, quite what that means, I don't know, but, uh—

Just play the tune

(laughing) And, anyway, we've picked up quite a number of his songs, "Eyesight To The Blind," which is on the Tommy album, we picked up from him, and also this song, which I think has got to be one of his best. It's one of his own compositions, which he wrote when he was about forty—

A teenager!

Just a mere teenager, and he called it, "Young Man Blues."


Well a young man
Ain't got nothin' in the world these days
I said a young man
Ain't got nothin' in the world these days

Well, you know in the old days
When a young man was a strong man
All the people they stepped back
When a young man walked by


But you know nowadays
It's the old man
Who's got all the money
And a young man
Ain't got nothin' in the world these days, I say
Ain't got nothin'
Ain't got sweet fuck all!


Everybody knows, everybody knows, everybody knows
He ain't got—
Ooh, yeah!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah!
Yeah
Get it
Everybody knows, everybody knows
In the old days
Everybody stepped back
When a young man walked, walked by
They stepped back!
They stepped back!
They stepped back!

Nowadays, if you're the young man
You ain't got nothin' in the world these days, I said!
They ain't got nothin'
Ain't got sweet fuck all!


Thank you



Oh, a stitch in time
Just about saved me
From going through the same old moves
And this cat is nine
He still suffers
He's going through the same old grooves
But that stone just keeps on rolling
Bringing me some real bad news
Takers get the honey
Givers sing the blues
Too many cooks, yeah
Spoil such a good thing
I know I laughed out loud but that was then
Ain't it funny, a fool and his money
Always seemed to find was those real good friends
That stone just keeps on rolling
Bringing me some real bad news
The takers get the honey
Givers sing the blues
Well that stone keeps on rolling
Bringing me some real bad news
The takers get the honey
Givers sing the blues
A stitch in time
Helps to unfold me
Circus starts at eight so don't be late
Please be so kind not to wake me
I think I'll just sit this one out
Well, I'm too rolling stoned
I'm too rolling stoned, yeah
Like a rolling stone
Just, just, just like a rolling stone
Rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling stone
Yeah, too rolling stoned
Oh just like a rolling stone
Well, like a rolling stone



Sugar magnolia, blossoms blooming, heads all empty, and I don't care.
Saw my baby down by the river; knew she'd have to come up soon for air
Sweet blossom come on. Under the willow, we can have high times if you'll abide
We can discover the wonders of nature rolling in the rushes down by the riverside
She's got everything delightful. She's got everything I need
Takes the wheel when I'm seeing double. Pays my ticket when I speed
She comes skimmin' through rays of violet. She can wade in a drop of dew
She don't come, and I don't follow. Waits backstage while I sing to you
Well, she can dance a Cajun rhythm. Jump like a willys in four wheel drive
She's a summer love in the spring, fall, and winter. She can make happy any man alive
Sugar magnolia ringing that bluebell, caught up in sunlight, come on out singing;
I'll walk you in the sunshine. Come on honey. Come along with me
She's got everything delightful. She's got everything I need:
A breeze in the pines and the sun and bright moonlight. Crazy in the sunlight. Yes, indeed
Sometimes when the cuckoo's crying, when the moon is half way down...
Sometimes when the night is dying, I take me out, and I wander around. I wander 'round
Sunshine daydream walking in the tall trees, going where the wind goes
Blooming like a red rose, breathing more freely
Ride our singin'; I'll walk you in the morning sunshine
Sunshine daydream, Sunshine daydream walking in the sunshine



I'm gonna tell you a story
I'm gonna tell you about my town
I'm gonna tell you a big bad story, baby
Aww, it's all about my town
Yeah, down by the river
Down by the banks of the river Charles (aw, that's what's happenin' baby)
That's where you'll find me
Along with lovers, muggers, and thieves (aw, but they're cool, too)
Well I love that dirty water
Oh, Boston, you're my home (oh, you're the Number One place)
Frustrated women (I mean they're frustrated)
Have to be in by twelve o'clock (oh, that's a shame)
But I'm wishin' and a-hopin, oh
That just once those doors weren't locked (I like to save time for
My baby to walk around)
Well I love that dirty water
Oh, Boston, you're my home (oh, yeah)
Because I love that dirty water
Oh, oh, Boston, you're my home (oh, yeah)
Well, I love that dirty water (I love it, baby)
I love that dirty water (I love Baw-stun)
I love that dirty water (Have you heard about the Strangler?)
I love that dirty water (I'm the man, I'm the man)
I love that dirty water (Owww!)
I love that dirty water (Come on, come on)



I'm a fleabit peanut monkey
All my friends are junkies
That's not really true
I'm a cold Italian pizza
I could use a lemon squeezer
Could you do?
But, I've been bit, and I've been tossed around
By every she-rat in this town
Have you, babe?

Well, I am just a monkey man
I'm glad you are a monkey woman too

I was bitten by a boar
I was gouged, and I was gored
But I pulled on through
Yes, I'm a sack of broken eggs
I always have an unmade bed
Don't you?
Well, I hope we're not too messianic
Or a trifle too satanic
We love to play the blues

Well, I am just a monkey man
I'm glad you are a monkey, monkey woman too, baby

I'm a monkey! I'm a monkey!
I'm a monkey man!  I'm a monkey man!
I'm a monkey! I'm a monkey! I'm a monkey! I'm a monkey!
M-m-m-monkey! M-m-m-m-monkey! I'm a m-m-m-monkey!
M-m-m-ma ma ma ma!
Ma ma ma ma ma
Ma ma ma ma ma monkey!
Ah! I'm a monkey!
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! ....



Ooh, mama
Well, look what's been done
You can only see the stars
After a setting sun

You run for the money
You don't even know about wild mountain honey

Come on, mama
Heal this lonesome man
Grow the tree of wholeness
In this desert land
Come on, children
Now learn how to run
By heaven, the stars, the moon and the sun

Come on, papa
Your end is the means
Don't trade your love and goodness
For the golden machine

You run for the money
You don't even know about wild mountain honey



Thirty days, Lord and thirty nights
I'm coming home on an airplane flight
Mama waiting at the ticket line
Tell me son why do you stand there crying

It was the needle and the spoon
And a trip to the moon
Took me away, took me away

I've been feeling so sick inside
Got to get better, lord before I die
Seven doctors couldn't help my head, they said
You better quit, son before you're dead

Quit the needle. quit the spoon
Quit the trip to the moon
We're going to take you away. Lord, we going to take you away
It was the needle and the spoon


I've seen a lot of people who thought they were cool
But then again, Lord I've seen a lot of fools
Well, I hope you people, Lord can hear what I say
You'll have your chance to hit it some day
Don't mess with the needle or a spoon
Or any trip to the moon
It'll take you away

Lord, they gonna bury you boy
Don't mess with the needle
Now I know, I know, I know, I know, I know



So tired
Tired of waiting
Tired of waiting for you
So tired
Tired of waiting
Tired of waiting for you
I was a lonely soul
I had nobody
'Til I met you
But you keep-a me waiting
All of the time
What can I do?
It's your life
And you can do what you want
Do what you like
But please don't keep-a me waiting
Please don't keep-a me waiting
'Cause I'm so tired
Tired of waiting
Tired of waiting for you
So tired
Tired of waiting
Tired of waiting for you
I was a lonely soul

'Til I met you
But you keep-a me waiting
All of the time
What can I do?
It's your life
And you can do what you want
Do what you like
But please don't keep-a me waiting
Please don't keep-a me waiting
'Cause I'm so tired
Tired of waiting
Tired of waiting for you
So tired
Tired of waiting
Tired of waiting for you
For you
For you



I'm sittin' in my room, I'm starin' out my window
And I wonder where you've gone
Thinking back on the happy hours just before the dawn
Outside the wind is blowin'
It seems to call your name again, where have you gone
City streets and lonely highways, I travel down
My car is empty and the radio just seems to bring me down
I'm just tryin' to find me
A pretty smile that I can get into
It's true, I'm lost without you
Another lonely park, another Sunday
Why is it life turns out that way
Just when you think you got a good thing
It seems to slip away
It's warm outside, no clouds are in the sky
But I need myself a place to go and hide
I keep it to myself, I don't want nobody else
To see me cryin' all those tears in my eyes
Another lonely park, another Sunday
Why is it life turns out that way
Just when you think you got a good thing
It seems to slip away
Another park, another Sunday
It's dark and empty, thanks to you
I got to get myself together
But it's hard to do
Another park, another Sunday
Why is it life turns out that way
Just when you think you got a good thing
It seems to slip away
Another park, another Sunday
It's dark and empty, thanks to you
I got to get myself together
But it's hard to do



Come on everybody, we're gonna' have a good time, yeah

When I think of those East End lights, muggy nights
The curtains drawn in the little room downstairs
Prima Donna, lord, you really shoulda been there
Sittin' like a princess perched in her electric chair
And it's one more beer, and I don't hear you anymore
We've all gone crazy lately
My friend's out there, rollin' 'round the basement floor (Ooh)

And someone saved my life tonight, sugar bear (sugar bear)
You almost had your hooks in me, didn't you, dear?
You nearly had me roped and tied
Altar-bound, hypnotized, sweet freedom whispered in my ear
You're a butterfly, and butterflies are free to fly
Fly away, high away, bye-bye (Ooh)


I never realized the passin' hours of evening showers
A slip noose hangin' in my darkest dreams
I'm strangled by your haunted social scene
Just a pawn out-played by a dominating queen
It's four o'clock in the morning, damn it! Listen to me good
I'm sleepin' with myself tonight
Saved in time, thank God my music's still alive
(Oh!)
Someone saved my life tonight, sugar bear
(Sugar bear, sugar bear)
You almost had your hooks in me, didn't you, dear?
You nearly had me roped and tied
Altar-bound, hypnotized, sweet freedom whispered in my ear
You're a butterfly, and butterflies are free to fly
Fly away, high away, bye-bye (Ooh)


And I would've walked head-on into the deep end of the river
Clingin' to your stocks and bonds
Payin' your H.P. demands forever
They're comin' in the mornin' with a truck to take me home
Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
So save your strength, and run the field you play alone

Someone saved my life tonight, sugar bear
(Sugar bear, sugar bear, sugar bear)
You almost had your hooks in me, didn't you, dear?
You nearly had me roped and tied
Altar-bound, hypnotized, sweet freedom whispered in my ear
You're a butterfly, and butterflies are free to fly
Fly away, high away, bye-bye
Someone saved, someone saved, someone saved my life tonight
(Someone saved my life tonight)
Someone saved, someone saved, someone saved my life tonight
(Someone saved my life tonight)
Someone saved, someone saved, someone saved my life tonight
(Someone saved my life tonight)
Someone saved, someone saved, someone saved my life tonight
(Someone saved my life tonight)
Someone saved, someone saved, someone saved my life tonight
(Someone saved my life tonight)
Someone saved, someone saved, someone saved my life tonight
(Someone saved my life tonight)
Someone saved, someone saved, someone saved my life tonight
(Someone saved my life tonight)



Wake up momma, turn your lamp down low
Wake up momma, turn your lamp down low
You got no nerve baby, to turn Uncle John from your door

I woke up this morning, I had them Statesboro Blues
I woke up this morning, had them Statesboro Blues
Well, I looked over in the corner baby, and Grandpa seemed to have them too

Well my momma died and left me, my poppa died and left me
I ain't good looking baby but I'm somewhat sweet and kind
I'm goin' to the country, baby do you wanna go?
But if you can't make it baby, your sister Lucille said she wanna go
And I sure will take her

I love that woman, better than any woman I've ever seen
Well I love that woman better than any woman I've ever seen
Now she treat me like a king, yeah, yeah, yeah
And she look like a dog gone queen

Wake up momma, turn your lamp down low
Wake up momma, turn your lamp down low
You got no nerve baby, to turn Uncle John from your door



Baby, baby
I'm gonna bring it on home to you
I've got my ticket, I've got that load
Got up, gone higher, all aboard
I'll take my seat, right way back, ooh yeah
Watch this train roll down the track
I'm gonna bring it on home
Bring it on home to you
Watch out, watch out

Try to tell you baby
What you trying to do?
Trying to love me, baby
And love some other men too
Bring it on home, bring it on home
Went a little walk downtown
Messed and got back late
Found a note there waiting
It said, "Daddy, I just can't wait."
Bring it on home, bring it on home
Bring it back home, bring it back home to me, baby

Tell you, pretty baby
You love to mess me around
I'm going to give you loving, baby
Going to move you out of town
Bring it on home, bring it on home
Sweetest little baby daddy ever saw
I'm going to give you loving, baby
I'm going to give you more
Bring it on home, bring it on home
Bring it on home, oh, right
Bring it on home, bring it on home to you



Some people ain't no damn good
You can't trust 'em you can't love 'em
No good deed goes unpunished
And I don't mind bein' their whippin' boy
I've had that pleasure for years and years
No no I never was a sinner--tell me what else can I do
Second best is what you get 'til you learn to bend the rules
And time respects no person--what you lift up must fall
They're waiting outside to claim my tumblin' walls
Saw my picture in the paper
Read the news around my face
And now some people don't want to treat me the same
When the walls come tumblin' down
When the walls come crumblin' crumblin'
When the walls come tumblin' tumblin' down
Some people say I'm obnoxious and lazy
I'm uneducated--my opinion means nothin'
But I know I'm a real good dancer
Don't need to look over my shoulder to see what I'm after
Everybody's got their problems--ain't no new news here
I'm the same old trouble you've been havin' for years
Don't confuse the problem with the issue girl
It's perfectly clear
Just a human desire to have you come near
Wanna put my arms around you
Feel your breath in my ear
You can bend me you can break me
But you'd better stand clear
When the walls come tumblin' down
When the walls come crumblin' crumblin'
When the walls come tumblin' tumblin' down



I got nasty habits
I take tea at three
Yes, and the meat I eat for dinner
It must be hung up for a week
My best friend, he shoots water rats
And feeds them to his geese
Don't you think there's a place for you
In between the sheets?

Come on now, honey
We can build a home for three (Yeah)
Come on now, honey
Don't you want to live with me?
Woo!

And there's a score of harebrained children
They're all locked in the nursery
They got earphone heads, they got dirty necks
They're so 20th century
Well, they queue up for the bathroom
'Round about 7:35
Don't you think we need a woman's touch
To make it come alive?
You'd look good
Pram-pushing down the high street
Come on now, honey
Don't you want to live with me?
Whoa, the servants they're so helpful, dear
The cook she is a whore
Yes, the butler has a place for her
Behind the pantry door
Woo!
The maid, she's French, she's got no sense
She's from the Crazy Horse
And when she strips, the chauffeur flips
The footman's eyes get crossed
Woo!

Don't you think there's a place for us
Right across the street?
Don'cha think there's a place for you
In between the sheets?



Open your eyes
Let it begin with me
Brand new day
Fresh new way to live
The morning is calling
Walk with me into the sun

Everything is coming our way

Here's my hand
Reaching out to you
Take it, darling
And lead me on, yeah


I can feel it in my bones
No man stands alone
Sister, Brother
From all the same seed



In the evening
When the day is done
I'm looking for a woman
But the girl don't come
So don't let her
Play you for a fool
She don't show no pity baby
She don't make no rules

Oh, oh, I need your love
I need your love
Oh, I need your love
I just got to have

So don't you let her
Oh, get under your skin
It's only bad luck and trouble
From the day that you begin
I hear you crying in the darkness
Don't ask nobody's help
Ain't no pockets full of mercy baby
Because you can only blame yourself
Oh, oh, I need your love
I need your love
Oh, I need your love
I got to have

Oh it's simple
All the pain that you go through
You can turn away from fortune, fortune
Because that's all that's left to you
It's lonely at the bottom
Man, it's dizzy at the top
But if you're standing in the middle
Ain't no way you're gonna stop

Oh, oh, I need your love
Oh, oh, I need your love
Oh, oh, I need your love
I got to have


Oh whatever
That your days may bring
No use hiding in a corner
Because that won't change a thing
If you're dancing in the doldrums
One day soon, it's got to stop, it's got to stop
When you're the master of the off-chance
When you don't expect a lot
Oh, oh, I need your love
I need your love
Oh, I need your love
I got to have, I got to have
I got to have your love
I got to have
Babe, I got to have your love
I got to have your love
Just got to



Bell bottom blues, you made me cry
I don't want to lose this feeling
And if I could choose a place to die
It would be in your arms

Do you want to see me crawl across the floor to you?
Do you want to hear me beg you to take me back?
I'd gladly do it because
I don't want to fade away
Give me one more day, please
I don't want to fade away
In your heart I want to stay

It's all wrong, but it's all right
The way that you treat me baby, mmh
Once I was strong but I lost the fight
You won't find a better loser

Do you want to see me crawl across the floor to you?
Do you want to hear me beg you to take me back?
I'd gladly do it because
I don't want to fade away
Give me one more day, please
I don't want to fade away
In your heart I want to stay

Do you want to see me crawl across the floor to you?
(Oh, yeah-yeah)
Do you want to hear me beg you to take me back?
I'd gladly do it 'cause
I don't want to fade away
Give me one more day, please
I don't want to fade away
In your heart I want to stay

Bell bottom blues, don't say goodbye
We're surely gonna meet again
And if we do, don't you be surprised
If you find me with another lover

Do you want to see me crawl across the floor to you?
Do you want to hear me beg you to take me back?
I'd gladly do it 'cause
I don't want to fade away
Give me one more day, please
I don't want to fade away
In your heart I want to stay
I don't want to fade away
Give me one more day please
I don't want to fade away
In your heart I want to stay
I don't want to fade away
Give me one more day please
I don't want to fade away
In your heart I want to stay



Agents of the law
Luckless pedestrian
I know you're out there
With rage in your eyes and your megaphones
Saying all is forgiven
Mad dog surrender
How can I answer
A man of my mind can do anything

I'm a bookkeeper's son
I don't want to shoot no one
Well I crossed my old man back in Oregon
Don't take me alive
Got a case of dynamite
I could hold out here all night
Yes I crossed my old man back in Oregon
Don't take me alive
Can you hear the evil crowd
The lies and the laughter
I hear my inside
The mechanized hum of another world
Where no sun is shining
No red light flashing
Here in this darkness
I know what I've done
I know all at once who I am
I'm a bookkeeper's son
I don't want to shoot no one
Well I crossed my old man back in Oregon
Don't take me alive
Got a case of dynamite
I could hold out here all night
Yes I crossed my old man back in Oregon
Don't take me alive

Don't take me alive

(Let's sway) while colour lights up your face
(Let's sway) sway through the crowd to an empty space

If you say run, I'll run with you
And if you say hide, we'll hide
Because my love for you would break my heart in two
If you should fall, into my arms and tremble like a flower

(Let's dance)
(Let's dance)

(Let's dance) for fear your grace should fall
(Let's dance) for fear tonight is all
(Let's sway) you could look into my eyes

When I'm with you, it doesn't matter where we are
Or what we're doing, I'm with you, that's all that matters
Time passes much too quickly when we're together laughing
I wish I could sing it to you, oh no
I wish I could sing it to you

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)
Mostly I'm silent
Mmm, silent la la la la la
Never think of bad words to say

When I kiss you, I feel a thousand different feelings
The color of chills all over my body
And when I feel them, I quickly try to decide which one
I should try to put into words, oh no
Try to put into words

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)

I'm just a-wandering on the face of this earth
Meeting so many people who are trying to be free
And while I'm traveling, I hear so many words
Language barriers broken, now we've found the key
And if you want the wind of change to blow about you
And you're the only other person to know, don't tell me
I'm just a singer in a rock and roll band
A thousand pictures can be drawn from one word
Only who is the artist, we got to agree
A thousand miles can lead so many ways
Just to know who is driving, what a help it would be
So if you want this world of yours to turn about you
And you can see exactly what to do, please tell me
I'm just a singer in a rock and roll band
How can we understand
Riots by the people, for the people
Who are only destroying themselves?
And when you see a frightened person
Who is frightened by the people
Who are scorching this earth (Scorching this earth)
Scorching this earth (Scorching this earth)
I'm just a-wandering on the face of this earth
Meeting so many people who are trying to be free
And while I'm traveling, I hear so many words

You're sailing softly through the sun
In a broken stone age dawn
You fly so high

I get a strange magic
Oh, what a strange magic
Oh, it's a strange magic
Got a strange magic

You're walking meadows in my mind
Making waves across my time
Oh no, oh no

I get a strange magic
Oh, what a strange magic

Oh, I'm never gonna be the same again

Well, listen everybody
To what I got to say
There's hope for tomorrow
Ooh, we're workin' on today
Well, it happened long ago
In the new magic land
The Indian and the buffalo
They existed hand in hand
The Indian needed food
He needed skins for a roof
But he only took what they needed, baby
Millions of buffalo were the proof
Yeah, it's all right
But then came the white man
With his thick and empty head
He couldn't see past the billfold
He wanted all the buffalo dead
It was sad...It was sad
Oh yeah
Yes, indeed
Oh, yes
It happened a long time ago, baby
In the new magic land
See, the Indian and the buffalo
They existed hand in hand
The Indians, they needed some food
And some skins for a roof
They only took what they needed, baby
Millions of buffalo were the proof, yeah
But then came the white dogs
With their thick and empty heads
They couldn't see past the billfold
They wanted all the buffalo dead
Everything was so sad
When I looked above the canyon wall
Some strong eyes did I see
I think it's somebody comin' around
To save my ass, baby
I think- I think he's comin' around
To save you and me
Boys
I said above the canyon wall
Strong eyes did glow
It was the leader of the land, baby
Oh my God
The great white buffalo!
Look out!!!! Look out!!!!!!!
Well, he got the battered herd
He led 'em 'cross the land
With the great white buffalo
They gonna make a final stand
The great white buffalo
Comin' around to make a final stand
Well, look out here he comes
The great white buffalo, baby
The great white buffalo
Look out, here he comes
He's doin' all right
Makin' everything all right
Yeah, yeah, yeah



I am an Outlaw, I was born an Outlaw's son
The highway is my legacy
On the highway I will run
In one hand I've a Bible
In the other I've got a gun
Well, don' you know me, I'm the man who won

Woman don't try to love me
Don't try to understand
A life upon the road
Is the life of an outlaw man

First left my woman, it was down in Santa Fe
Headed for Oklahoma, I was riding night and day
All of my friends are strangers
They quickly come and go
And all my love's in danger
Because I steal hearts and souls

Woman, don't try to love me
Don't try to understand
A life upon the road
Is the life of an outlaw man
Some men call me Abel
Some men call me Cain
Some men call me Sinner, Lord
Some men call me Saint
Some say there's a Jesus
Some men say there ain't
When you got no life to lose
Then there's nothing left to gain

Outlaw man
Outlaw man



I still remember it was autumn and the moon was shinin'
My '60 Cadillac was rollin' through Nebraska whinin'
Doin' a hundred twenty, man the fields was bendin' over
Headin' out for the mountains knowin' we was travelin' further
All our fires were blazin'
And the spinnin' wheels were turnin' turnin'
Had my girl beside me brother brother she was burnin' burnin'
Up walked  a Baptist preachin' southern funky school teacher
She had a line on something heavy but we couldn't reach her
We told her that we needed something that would get us goin'
She put out all she had and laid it on the counter showin'
All I had to do was lay my money down and pick it up
The cops came bustin' in
And then we lit out in a pickup truck and go
Get out of Denver better go go
Get out of Denver better go
Get out of Denver better go go
Get out of Denver cause you look just like a commie
And you might just be a member baby
Get out of Denver baby
Get out of Denver
Well the red lights were flashin'
And the sirens were a screamin' screamin'
We had to pinch each other just to see if we were dreamin'
Made it to Loveland Pass in under less than half an hour
Lord it started drizzlin' and it turned into a thunder shower
The rain was drivin' but the Caddy kept on burnin' rubber
We kept on drivin' till we ran through some fog for cover
We couldn't see a thing, somehow we just kept on goin'
We kept on drivin' all night long and then into the mornin'
Fog had finally lifted when we looked to see where we was at
We're starrin' at a Colorado state policeman trooper captain
He said ...
Get out of Denver better go go
Get out of Denver better go
Get out of Denver better go go
Get out of Denver cause you look just like a commie
And you might just be a member baby
Get out of Denver baby
Get out of Denver



Oh no, oh no
Here we go now
Oh no, oh now
Here we go now

Got a crazy feeling I don't understand
Got to get away from here
Feeling like I should have kept my feet on the ground
Waiting for the sun to appear

Mamma's going to worry
I've been a bad, bad boy
No use saying sorry
It's something that I enjoy

Because you can't see what my eyes see
(I can see it, I can see it)
And you can't be inside of me
Flying high again
I can see through mountains, watch me disappear
I can even touch the sky
Swallowing colours of the sound I hear
Am I just a crazy guy (you bet)
Mamma's going to worry
I've been a bad, bad boy
No use saying sorry
It's something that I enjoy

If you could be inside my head
You'd see that black and white is red
Flying high again
Flying high again
Flying high again
Flying high again
Come on and join me

Flying high again
Flying high again
Flying high again
Flying high again
Come on and join me

Oh no, oh no
Here we go now
Oh no, oh now
Here we go now
Daddy thinks I'm lazy he don't understand
Never saw inside my head
People think I'm crazy but I'm in demand
Never heard a thing I said

Mamma's going to worry
I've been a bad, bad boy
No use saying sorry
It's something that I enjoy

Flying high again
Flying high again
Flying high again
Flying high again
