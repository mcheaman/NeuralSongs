In these days of superstition
When sights are just one big thing
Childhood dreams they may seem
Wrong time, though (Ah, yeah)
When love is a couple
That's the way (Ah, yeah)
I believe

Now, the man in the silk chiffon gown
With the diamond rings
Beyond her door
Doesn't say why, though
Her eyes are clear as day
And she's satisfied
Hold you in her arms
Like a wife for a year

Now, the world is a tree
And the branches never fall
And yet there is something wrong with you
And it seems to bother you
And you are free to be what

Every single day, I got a heartache comin' out of my
Sickness, I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place
Hoses are hooting and hooting, house-breaking sound like
A bout school, but I don't know about G.E.
1966-87 (def. notes) (def. notes)
Wanting stronger ideas faster than I could handle
Headlines in the local paper, Coach's died
And the headliners didn't make it, fell to the
Television. I was the not the best singer in the
Southland, but by the time I got the part, the part
That was Seedways in the Southland, we was
Really in the Top 10 in a Led Zeppelin!
A genuine problem? Yeah! That's true!
We recorded a Rolling Stone, and we
Said was that a joke? Been a real joke for a long, long, long
I think about Seedways, think about what I got hassines
That I can't help thinking about: Jack White, the Rolling Stone
How could a Rolling Stone make such a Stanwyck sound?
A-how? Well, Seedways, how can I reach Seedways?

Speak up! One of these nights
Speak up! Seedways! Seedways! Seedways! Seedways! Seedways!
Seedways! Seedways! Seedways! Seedways! Seedways!

I'm from the past, Seedways! Seedways! Seedways! Seedways! Seedways! Seedways!
Seedways! Seedways! Seedways! Seedways! Seedways! Seedways!

Or you might lose out and get unlucky

Starfighter design, but burn it down
Racing to the final mile is just as useless
As is dealing with the today
'"geographically shifting flows of new energy that flow beneath our worldwide net presence," the U.S.Man"
"The changing nature of the lowlands along the Texas and the Central Plains"
These are the kinds of words we should tell President Clinton
"State your case for the Iraq War"
"As the war nears, sign up for our free "like" service"
We can claim you George's Best, you know Best
We were born and raised in a segregated South
You better sign up, you better get yourselves a Quality Scotch Whisky "lecture"
We were segregated in public schools until you saw what they do

Babe, I'm making history now
Take my production line and start smoking weed
Let's see if that keeps me in jail

I got a line of pipes all hanging down
Look at the end of a pipe
Can be seen as a threat
Hey, I'm a stoppin' a bell
Keep on smoking that damn joint and boogie
Yeah, you better keep your eyes on the road
You better keep your eyes on the motorbike track

There's a black man in a t-shirt
Lives in a dream
His feet don't evenhang a foot
His face is a thin line
Runnin' through the fog
Everybody needs a little encouragement
To run even farther
And if you want toil like a running pig
Just lift your head, hoist your head high

And if you want to be free
Just lift your head, hoist your head high
And if you want to be free
Just lift your head, hoogie, "Look, I'm a running man"

And if you want to survive
Just lift your head, hoogie, "Carry on, keep running"
And if you want to be free
Just lift your head, hoogie, "Where I'll live my life"
And if you want to be free
Just lift your head, hoogie, "Where I'll live my life"

I hit rock bottom
My money man
We found a podient man
In the desert
The nutcase man

I don't give a fuck
Money, I don't give a fuck

Against the light, there lies the thief
He is so deep and so faraway
He calls his horse with a bell
But he can't come, he really doesn't like it
The iron bridle, it's a drag on his back
The sighs of the lonely, they're making it hard
He's calling his sister in some bad way
But he can't come, he really doesn't like it
The golden rings, they're some kind of a perverted way
He calls his maid, she's just a friend of the devil
But he can't come, he really doesn't like it
The iron bridle

In this dirty little slinky scene, from "Shameless," where Marie Antoinette, played by Diane Sawyer, can't get a pen
And the scene in Jack and Diane's place where Bo dips and Jack likes
So Diane and Jack whip up a drink called the "Spin-Pep action"
And the drink's called the "Spin-Pep action" the first time you've seen it

All night, everywhere, everywhere

Doo doo doo-doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo-doo doo doo doo doo-Doo doo doo-doo doo-doo doo-doo doo-doo doo
Doo doo doo-doo doo doo doo doo-Doo doo-doo doo-doo doo-doo doo-doo
All night, everywhere, everywhere

The Rolling Stones and the Queen, crossing the ocean for eight more hours
Surrender, balk, bitch, there's too much to do
Fuck the whip, the mitts, the underbelly
Fuck the legs, the hands all over Diane Sawyer
And here they stand, nine dollars on the treadmill, hard to land

Jump up, Jack and Marilyn, you blow me out
Fuck the whip, the underbelly
Fuck the knees, the feet, the hands all over Diane Sawyer

We're done with you guys
Oh, the cold rain

We can still play the games

But we've got to stop romantic
Harm to the genuine emotion
Enough is enough

I've been through the sheriff's boxes
I've seen 'em burn, he don't give a damn
He's a good man, but he's a deputy
Oh, but he doesn't give a damn
About a man who shot and killed a baby
Give 'em a ride
You're the same as a WAC-a-Fatt
Haha

I'm back in town
I got my old bag
Two bags of cocaine
Two plastic bags
From a dead sheriff
Haha

Oh, heh heh

About the time that I hitched
I'm all for you and your dreams

There is unrest in the forest
Some report smelling
Devil and all His fruit
;-)


There is a wildfire in the forest
Some tell them the leaves are turnin'
They are out to see what they can find
There is no place for them in the city
And they give the news to them
There is no time to sleep at night
Many a night has gone by
One could not live without
Sleep has no name
Many a fool once said
 "'tis not the language to save
'T is not the language to win
And it is not the language to lose
'T is not the language to lose
And it is not the language to win
Sleep has no name
There is no time to cry
There is no time to sleep
Many a night has gone

We all came out to Montreux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
But Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid fool had the gall to break the law

Hads been writing in memory of the
Romeans
Lonesome morning they awoke
To find us in their city
Their dark shadows casting their shadows
About their restless nights

We took the road that leads to
The Hall de Res
There to hear the music of the
Eagles, for the music was calling
Along the bank of the river
We met a fine young man
With a memory that never dies
We shook hands
And began to write

"Lonely evenings grow colder
And a passion that lingers
In the eeriest dreams
As the words whispered by you
And the eeriest nights grow cooler
Like the coldest nights of winter
Got no calling upon me
And the silence that surrounds you
Just remind you of me
As the only one who we are
Really is beyond all compare
You are no longer with me
Far from the city"

Rain falling on a Saturday
Down at the Hotel Belle
I heard them play the blues
And I was wrong all along
The Red Hot and Red Not

It had to have
Was that a spell or is it a feeling?

They were singing in the green

Behind the door

There is unrest in the forest
There is trouble in the field of battle
All the women and children

And they're all sitting cross-legged
Clad in their white crosstown slippers
In her crazy mind
The flashing memory of war
Will forever haunt her

In the ruined town
In the burned out moving lot
Came a sound she couldn't forget
Like a dying miracle
Like the snap of a switchblade

And she bent down on the transistor
In the tumbling loops of her old computer

Had her milkshake to keep her up till 7 AM
She took a halfhearted sip of water
Sounded as if she were lost in a dream
Turned off the beat like a carbonaro, daughter
In a volcano, full of craters

Oh, the ruin
There she was with her eyes and her face in the rock
Dazed and confused, Goldilocks were greeting us
And theyre cowards and they're serving us dish

Oh, the ruin

Just a small-town girl
Livin' down the beatin' street
Another midnight
They're ringing her bell
And it's just her turn to sing

Just don't down your bell

I don't want to down your bell
Just don't down your bell

There is unrest in the forest
There is trouble in the field of battle
And the words of wisdom both spoken and heard
Lieall lies somewhere in the distance
And all the trees are singing, "One accord," goes the song
And the miles run up and down his way
Makes it so much easier, so much easier
There is no turning back
There is no turning back
On the run with the wrong answer
Well, there is no consolation at all
There is no feeling in the night
Somewhere in the misty morning sunlight
And the changing of the seasons
Means that no amount of wine, of soft-ee-sucky-sucky-sucky
Could lessen the pain so completely

There is no easy answer
There is no easy answer
There is no easy answer
There is no easy answer
There is no easy answer
There is no easy answer
There is, no easy answer

Heartbreaker, take another chance
This time wouldn't be different
Not with more time in the jovin' before I get started
Enough time break here, full blast now
You'd think I'd be falling, sink your feet
Drops like a whisper in the wind
You'd think I was changing places, high five, person

Satisfied but lost in another guy
Pleaded with reservations, raised my bar
Enough time break here, full blast now
You'd think I'd be falling, sink your feet
Drops like a whisper in the wind
You'd think I was changing places, high five, person

Oh, well, there's no easy answer

Love is but a song you can die by
You can burn up to stay
Don't give in and you can lose a little heart

If I knew what they felt like
How they felt would be their decision
They would say what a man should
Then they would come and go
Then they would change their ways

If I knew they cried
How they feel they feel right now
The day they lived

Don't give in and you can die
'Cause life can't get to them
Little fingers the old man used to call
Keep on trying, don't give in and you can die

'Cause life can't get to them

Call it a day, and you'll find your place
In the proud hearts of every boy and girl
Rock and roll will always be your tradition
Do you believe it or not, do you?

That is what I'm looking at you, a man

It's a heavy day's work
You must be blameless
For a part of me desires vengeance
I've come to take vengeance on those I dislodge
That is what I'm looking at you a man

Love reigns king
Until the year is gone
No more will there be a king

Like a lazy river, turning its backs on you
It surely does not anger me
Never, no, I will not stand

Like a boiled dove, snorin' all my needs
'Cause I will pay the price

Strange brew reigns
On the third platform, will you ride me
Stumbling on your own
? No, I will not cross
The high tide, it's calling
Will it set you on its tracks?

Strange brew reigns
On the third platform, will you ride me
Stumbling on your own
Strange brew reigns
On the third platform, will you ride me
Stumbling on your own
Strange brew reigns

Strange beer pours
Pleasantly sweet and bitter, pleased to please
And pleased to please, I bring you a medicine
No, no, ye wast no time
Diligent showers lie
En route to Cremora

Pleased to meet you, Tsuzie a tra Wort

How does the music business operate?
Without a movement on my part to justify it
Without me as a co-pioneer
======================================== SAMPLE 17 ========================================
In the alleyway, in the corner of my mind
It's the worst feeling that I can
Like, what if?
There's a Buick drop'n'loud, and I got a voice in my head
Say, "Get off the line" and I'm tossed out the door
Easy get in the way, easy get out the door
If you can't be rid of, Easy get in the way
Easy get in the way and I got no future here to entertain
If you can't be rid of, Easy get in the way
Easy get out the door
If you can't be rid of, easy get in the way
Easy get out the door
Say, "We've had it with priced and unpriced here at home"
And though it may be tollway thirty one
The words we use and the time we've invested has paid
The odometer read 'pitiful', while the one on the mirror
We can't get no satisfaction
Say, "If you give us an answer, babe, we'll print out 'em"
Easy get in the way, easy get out the door
Easy get in the way
Easy get out the door
Say, easy get in the way

There is nothing I can do

Winter is here again, oh lord
Haven't been home too long
Can't go home too long
With a view that's been made to seem a little screwed
I'm carryin' a face that no one could tell me now
And it's such a big deal to all of you
I'm carryin' a face so big and fast now
Yeah can't you see it's a big deal to all of you

I'm the cruisin' of your heart
Can't go home too long
It's such a big deal to all of you
Can't go home too long
Even with a view, it's a big deal
To all of you
Can't go home too long
 old white working class man, can't you see it's a big deal

I'm the carryin' a face that no one could tell me now
And it's such a big deal to all of you
I'm carryin' a face so big and fast now
Yeah can't you see it's a big deal to all of you
Can't go home too long
Even with a view, it's a big deal
To all of you
Can't go home too long
 Old white working class man
Can't you see it's a big deal
Can't go home too long
Yeah, can't
