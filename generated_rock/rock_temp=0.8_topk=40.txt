Give me, give me a piece of your action
Stole the day when you had it
Stole the day when you could not find
I was the undersized "Hollywood" boy, your "gadgets" confused me
I rolled on the couch, I couldn't work out which way to the music
If you could see what was lies next

If I desired to, I could hear everything
If I was destined for, I could see what lies below
But you made me pay, cost me nothing

Like a rolling dice, the outcome is decided in a fire
The applause is deafening
Your "Roll call" keeps on rolling
Makes me wondering if there's a stretch
Where the Cadillac decided a driver's age
Is a fair game, game planed insect

ined, lost in a game of charade
Where are all of you when I need direction from home?
BuyableInstoreAndOnline white clouds frame the sky
As if by magic, I was granted the timeless effect
The deities jointly create a series of dreams
Each its own animal in its own way

So if I truly believe that what I'm saying is true
then there's no need to explain
There are masses of rock still living in the Timbs
Iheid platitudes, still used for years as a form of protest

Between now and then, I'll ask her why I left
I haven't got the details, but I know that it's due to the pain
JC Bentley took the time to listen
Not to advice, but to find a job
Conform to the dictates of the moment
 Removed from the house because of his race
Does anyone remember Maynords and Ors?
Living in her penthouse, white pickle gnomes tearing through mulattoes
Must have been around 2012 or 2013
To a large part of my language
But you can't speak it, can you?
Your head's in the air, your heart is in the ground

So if I truly believe that what I'm saying is true
Then there's no need to explain
There are masses of rock still living in the Timbs
Iheid platitudes, still used for years as a form of protest
I know better than to give her just a smile
She's about to give birth to a boy that's a lot like her
We'll all have to wait and see, but please don't let her hurry you down
There's a long standing Treaty between the several States of the United States of America

We'll probably end up in a ditch
Kind of like a great white shark

Feelin' good, feelin' satisfied
You know the satisfaction, the pleasure is to be had

STOP DRAGGING MY HEART AROUND
By Stevie Nicks
Baby you've ruined my baby
Stop, who's the only one I ever known
Where did we go, home? ABC's on
Baby, on the top of your lungs AIDS
The only proof that you can take
My baby, stop, stop, stand up
Stop proving I'm a lying bitch
Baby, I gave you everything I had to make you happy
Stop proving I'm a lying bitch
Stop proving I'm a lying bitch
Stop proving I'm a lying bitch
Stop proving I'm a lying bitch
 Stop proving I'm a lying bitch
 Stop proving I'm a lying bitch

STOP DRAGGING MY HEART AROUND
Baby, stop proving I'm a lying bitch
You made a great baby, but I don't know when you got the confidence
Once I was needy, now I adore you
But when you hanging off your back, I just don't know if you're the right hang
Once I was needy, I'd tease you but you just kept hanging
You didn't want to mess with no one but me, so I just left you alone
Now you're rocking that dirty woman, do you wanna dig it?
You wanna roll, I'm rocking with a chick who just might
You got that proof that you need I need
I need a wife on the air today, woo!
This is the day, the day, the day, the day, the day, the day, the day, the day, the

Museum of American Rock
In the shadow of
The fading sun
The sound of
their once proud city
But it's all being replaced
By the new menace

Listen to the wind blow
By any and all
For the soothing sound
And Drums are the new rule
And the peaceful rider
Pray come and tomorrow
For the home of the brave

Everywhere I hear the sound of marching, charging feet; Ha, Ha, baby
Mama, look what they've done to me
Baby, let me sing, baby, take my place

Here they come, there they come
Let's make the best of the situation

Can you hear us, everywhere?

Oh, can you hear us, everywhere?

They retreating on the night march
Have we left our home?
They retreating on the night march
Have we left our home?
Can you hear us, everywhere?
Oh, can you hear us?

In the fields and in the hollow
In the sunlight, in the laughter of the women
Oh, have we left our home?
They retreating on the night march
Have we left our home?
They retreating on the night march
Have we left our home?
Can you hear us, everywhere?
Oh, can you hear us?
In the cemetery and the remains
Of innocent faces, even today
Can you hear us, anywhere?

Oh, can you hear us? Everywhere?

Oh, can you hear us? Everywhere?
Oh, can you hear us? Everywhere! Every place! Every time! Every time!
Can you hear us? Every place! Every time!

You got me thinking that I'm wasting my time

Don't bring me down

{Intro}
She went to the mirror
And saw what was wrong
And said to herself "What am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do?
I can't see no reason
I can't breathe no reason"
So she said to myself "What am I gonna do
So I can't see no reason?"
Well now I see no reason
I can't breathe no reason
Well, I can't breathe, can't breathe no reason
Why can't I just let it go?
I can't breathe no reason
Well, I can't breathe, can't breathe no reason
Well, I can't breathe, can't breathe no reason
Well now I see no reason
I can't breathe no reason

People of the Earth are here
Around the sun and about it
Everywhere you'll see a small bird
Flying low into the night
People you see also know me
You see their faces, they see their cages
Cages that close on all too soon

And so I hear their cries
Their cries always echoised
In my sleep when they pass me by
I hear their voice saying "Take a look
This rock is meant for you"

And so I hear their cries
Their cries always crystallise
In my sleep when they pass me by
When they pass me by
When they pass me by

They say I'm strange
They say you're strange
I will send out ships of wail
To keep an eye on you

And so I hear their cries
Their cries
======================================== SAMPLE 4 ========================================
You just let me read your mind
Say "I" like "four" times a day
I see through your lies
I'll throw you an onion
Said you're a liar just like me

Yeah
I said
I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck about you
I don't give a fuck, yeah, yeah, uh

(Dedicate one to the ladies...)
Well, they calling all the time
From across the sea
They dying by the score of
I saw them stocking pickets come 'round
I heard them kicking and screaming
I knew they were there to stay

They come to town and they don't give a damn
They got round to anything that moves
They come and they don't give a darn
They got their groove on me, yeah
They got their groove on you, yeah
They got their groove on me, yeah

They say we make it too "like it"
We make it "like it"
Dee-dee-dee, dub one beat
Eep, it a do-ez-ee-dee
We make it like it is
Oh, it's a do-e-nine
It's a do-nine

They say we break it
We break it
We break it
We break it
We break it

Like it's the world, you're just a pawn
I found a diamond, give it to me
Give to me! Give to me!
Like it's the world, you're just a pawn
Give to me! Give to me!
Like it's the world, you're just a pawn

Lady Madonna, you make the pie
I'm talking about an American heartnut
derived from an American sweet potato
You know, like Sh-Shoon, we think it's right
And look to our side, we like to our side
And pie, there ain't not no reason
Could be right, it ain't, but it isn't
American, there's not a reason
Whoa, there ain't no shame in my action
I was good-lookin' and had a fine coat
And I was out with my girl, stoppin' the ride
And I thought I was a do-er, let's-ma win

Now, this ain't some kind of urban legend
Colored rock's always had a point in their share
And a do-er ain't no diplomat
In her queen you know she don't mind
She got a guitar and she can make music
That funky like it's in the '80s
I like to hear some rock 'n' roll
Music that ain't made of vinyl
Come in, come out with your head down, wanna die
I like to listen to some rock 'n' roll
Music that ain't made of vinyl
Come in, come out with your head down, to die
I like to listen to some rock 'n' roll

I'd like to do a song
 Called "Call It Off"
There ain't nothing better
But yet, cheap and loud
Away from home we're living in a paradise
With no school, without Wellington
And with no partaking of greed

Welcome to the paradise
The schoolboy's boy
Welcome to the paradise
The schoolgirl's girl
The schoolgirl's boy
The schoolgirl's boy

Schoolgirl, schoolgirl, schoolgirl

Hey, my name's Elinor, I'm a mean, mean bad luck
When I get her number I'm going to@#& start a new day
It's the new new expecting old problems
But when I get her number I'm going to
Start a new day
I don't know when it started or how it began
I don't know when it ended or just what it was for
But when I touch it I feel just like a fool

Old age starts and new beginnings
So don't let them fool you into thinking that
They don't know
That they don't know
That you don't know
That you don't know
That you don't know
That you don't know

There's a woman in her late sixties
Hotter than hell
Got the best of a support group
With her man the heat's only
And it seems to be exclusively

Male fans relate
The loneliness of the high stakes
Madness of the parting
Is perhaps best seen by looking in the mirror

To alleviate these feelings I recommend
The power of fantasy
The Matrix
This world's beyond my control
It's time I reawakening

I'll pull up just a little ways to your surprise
And I'll tell you what I want to know
If you'll see me in the open, I'll give you a treat
Just let me know if you like it
If you want to jump into my black space
Maybe next time, maybe again
If you want to jump into my black space
Maybe next time, maybe again
Catch my blood run-dd up
There's no way out of this town, 'cause
I'll show you my way
To your home in the sunshine

Had my Virginie up my old Grey
And my lipstick wast my aching Niggas Louboutins
'Cause they could not give me the respect I wanted

I was stoned with my original Samoans down, ooh
'Cause they were Chechens don't you think?
Said I snubbed Jey in favor of Gia
Had a virgin back when I could grab cheeseburgers
Not fond myself of your stringent J standards
No, I smacked your virgin in the shin, yeah
Spied every Indian's grave with my old buddies
But they couldn't figure out the cruder end of the joke
And my nigga Khaled Nadhem
Caught the newer kid with the brown bag
And the dirty mama wasn't home
Oh, my old chick ta-tac-to-t

I was ten years old
Learned to ignore most of the modern toys
I took a plane out to sea, going way back
To learn the wonders of the deep
Where the farsea crocodile lies, there's a beach for everyone
The turtle moonlights as a child fighter, whose name plaque
Dodging a snake in the sky, trying to get it to stop
And when I asked Uncle Sam for his "dad" he looked at me
kind of grim, like I was trying to say we were born in the same household

I was docked, extra-terrestrial, and told to turn my back on you
I was bitten by a aipole, Graham cat and mouse
It was only lightning, didn't kill me, no, I did my part
Holding a grudge, beating on my will and rights
Ioning hikers left hand on the Katyti, Indian reservation
Ah, the hand of the tyro
They said, "Release me, baby, I'll pay you back"

I followed the aipole dead, stuck out toes
Whisper girls stupid, and you'll be found

They chased me, God knows where, I caught a cold
But I was too high
I was docked, extra-terrestrial, I was followed
By God knows where, I was followed
I'm a mean little nigga, I'm a mean little nigga
That's why I ain't goin' anywhere

I was followed, I'm a God mama, I'm a God mama
Bitch, I'm a God mama, I'm a God mama
I'm a mean little nigga
That's why I ain't goin' anywhere
I'm a mean little nigga

I wanna live with a cinnamon girl
I've been saving all my money for a while
But she won't let me be
Nor should I let her be
, bam-ba-lama
The girl's lonely
You can't catch a hint from her

She's sweet as molasses
But she's the same old bitch to me

I tell her I don't care
A cinnamon girl ain't no friend of mine
I'm cinnamon as hell
And I'll tell her sweet as molasses
Don't let her get me here
In the cold wind of change
She's gonna make me
A contribution to the building of heaven
But don't treat me kindly
In the cold wind of your misery
You've made me a headache
You've made me aching, it's time I
Appreciate it
You made me aching, it's time I
Hate myself for the crime of greed
You've made meching, it's time I
Hate myself for the crime of benevolence
You've made meching, it's time I
