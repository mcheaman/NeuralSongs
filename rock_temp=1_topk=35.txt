Find a way to hide
I was stoned all night yesterday
I was holding my breath as the phone rang
Was this the end? No
Was this the beginning?
I'm fallin' for a liar, man
If you can't take it anymore
Look what's been done to us baby
Boy, your mother sweet, she really hurts

Keep on digging, you will find another Kentucky
You will find another Kentucky
You will find another Kentucky
You will find another Kentucky

Look out at the well, and you get lost in the past
And these are the times
That we must be coming home
Living in the past

36 COME SMOKE COME SEE MY FIRE
If it burns then so does my sanity
Praying constantly to promote
Gross devotion to so many strains
Demonstrating passions overpower
My musical gifts, conscious desires fade
Damn it, I'm comin' on the sabbatical;
I'm blessed to have so many new
patience's, conscientiousness may blind me
To the infinite possibilities of the loving
One who harmonized emotion with reason
Into what I grounded myself
A thinker's just a thinker's;
Saying that the ever-changing
text of thought is ever shifting and
seems ever changing and
changing, changing breeze is
ever concave and everern
Those words from ages ago
Making their livin' at the practice

Yeah, I've got that thing with the Fender's seven-note beat
I got it ungainly and easilyperverted
Don't get me wrong, I may be wise (omethiet)
I might play Hamilton at the age of twenty-five, yeah, but
I'm just a complete mess, a complete performer
No sense in myself

There are things that I want marathons to be and
There's one thing that I'd like to see more of
So let's do!
Surely not to party wear off, wear off
Hidin' on the way out?  Nothin''s changed
There's a dog who barked once and I tried to run
But I can't get out alive
Helpless in sorrow, one who know not where she stands
Wonder why you gotta stand still
When all of your loved ones are huddled
Heartless, one breathing in your dream
Waiting for your call
But what's comin' is not what you thought it was
You satisfied sorrow?  Not what you makin'
To be content with some empty shell
That's what you get when you're all alone
Many ears could hear you, but your mind was blind
Your eye did not hear what I said and you did not reply
In the heat of the passion pleasin'
What you think you heard, what you take to heart
Is it emotion or will your sound be different?
Spectacular!
The mask has been torn, the mask has been torn

And we will all grow

People say
that our life
Is built on a superstructure
That doesn't even allow
The superstructure to crumble
Chips of thunder and of steel
Flawless
Free will won't prevail
In the great game
No country in the world
Can be the land of hope

So decided the religion
Folding within

That the happiest days of our lives
May be the happiest days of our lives
With no profit
In the development of our love
We will all grow
When the old man is gone
Pastorfians

Take a long look around your house make it stand out b/c none of your rainbow things
Just a reflection of the rest of the shit, that don't look like mine
That's just the color of (A little) Rum
And a pretty good bitch, but ain't nobody's bet

Oh shit, so all of these statements look bad
But all of these statements feel right
So if you got a bitch who's been eating, I guess once a day
I ain't gonna fault you if you wreck my business, yeah
Ah yeah, don't you give me 'em!
I've been watching you but I just can't keep away
I thought I hear you, a woman, but I just hear what you say
Well all of these expressions come awfully fast
And all of my instincts kick in
If you're a woman, I guess she'll do
If you're a man, I guess she'll try to keep
My time is making reservations but I guess there's no point
I thought I'd need a favor from you, but now I do
And I did, indeed, on a trip down memory lane
Oh, I shot myself in the foot this time

My friend told me
"Hey lady, you're
So hard to love"
Like a brilliant light
On a thousand tiny stages
You try to frighten me away
All you got to frighten me away
Your lies, your phonies, and your snippits
Oh, they know I've got it on time
I'm skeptical of your disguise
You're able, able, able to vibe
Vulcan, this stuff I ain't even supposed to loose
You can tune this in, in the maestro
Zing!

I've been trying all night to make it work
One solution at a time
I'm just glad I found this little hobby
Huh? Only to have you make it unorthodox
And somehow get it right but go off course
I ain't ready to play
It's nowhere near my best
All you can do is make it seem limited
Your music is not a gimmick to lemmings, lemmins, latinials
It's not a snub to music that movesets
don't use on commercials
It's just music that weationalally fits
To plug in your mac or to wire in your ear
You just like it

Bopping down on a bleak beach
She stared as I walked through the doors
And then asked me in a gentle voice
"Hello?"
"Hey," I said, smiling.
"I wanna say a big thank you to you, loving mother
For always believing me and me giving in
And giving me all the answer she could come to
What you up to?

I met a woman there named Rosie
That was out running with the boys
Around town
Rosie was hot and running
And it was getting really hot out there
And I was wondering what the boys were doing in heat
When out on the street
Rollin' out the trash, stealing money
And out on the street, running with the boys
I met a dame, Delia
Who was lonely but had something for me
She had just given birth to a child out back

Learning is hard
You must love your training
Take the first step
You want to shake it up Rod Stewart
But your fears star above
They say you can never see what it's like to be strong
Don't know what it's like to be free
Superman says take the first step
Don't know what it's like to be alone

Dedication is all you and me really need
It's so much better knowing that ninja
And you need me more than a ninja
Are you that surprised?

I need you somehow, need you
I need you somehow

Strong is hard to find
So hard to find
Are you that surprised?

Dedication is all that really matters
So hard to find

Searchin' for the right words to make you burn like a candle
Panic attacked in my mind from the blue
Why did I not flee, run away?

Tryin' to find a way to make an album with you

You better beat the clock, beat the clock, beat the clock, beat the clock
Oh no, no, won't you tell me?
And when I'm begging, I better beg, and when I'm begging, I know I don't get it and it hurts my neck
Don't get me crying either
(Ooh) Come easy, come easy, easy, baby, I ain't fooling
(Ooh) Oh, don't you worry 'bout me though
(Ooh) I'm just a baby, come easy, come easy, baby, I am a confident, hard-headed woman

Move you outply
I thought it was too lenient
Despite the fact that I belong here
Dustin, I mean that again
Yeah, when you don't see the score, quit emceeing
I feel like the punishment
Yeah, if you ain't here, I don't clue
And I don't, and that's really all that's required
Eight years of this shit, you see that we had blossomed
Notched a constellation on our NASA, now we got a torpor


Flyer singing "Hallelujah, if you see our counter, we rabble here")
Now, my world's a fit, she hasn't been jov'ed
She tweeted I for estrangement from my family, who is a disgrace
I'll think of a game, like football, where do we go?
I'm playing crass, I'm from Compton, try hiding
In aPoké, heh, we have a respectable team
Day one, we played in the MLS First that when we broke up
Made it to the Wonderwall, forced to run around
Lost a kick trial, who doesn't love the

Wild horses as they sing
In a thousand words they say
In a dream they come to you
In a thousand miles they come to you

Wild horses as they sing sing
In a thousand words they say
In a dream they come to you
In a thousand miles they come to you
In a thousand colors your

Neath the sun you
Fly on as you are
You are you - your world now
As the miles come to an end
You are you all

I was a little over forty, and I lost a whole mean
My time was running out
I was thinking that maybe I'd lost my mind
I was running out on the plain

Don't let it get to you, don't let it get to me
Don't let it get to you, don't let it get to me

Don't let it get to you, don't let it get to me
Don't let it get to

Feelin' good, gotta run out there and they said, "Quit whining." I don't blame 'em, no it's okay

You better keep your mama's farm
Keep till the little people, uh
Listen to what I say, we're dying to be a man
But we got to get ahead, we got to grow
Got to feed the babies I can't take anymore
Got to keep a gander in 'till I'm done ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
We got to keep getting ahead, we got to grow
Got to keep getting an inch or two
To be a man, we got to keep getting an inch or two
We got to keep getting an inch or two

Ooooooh I seen your face
I see yours roll like a gyro
Drive like a gyro to the wall
Ooh, the sun will shine on me
Ooh, I felt love roll down my spine
Ooh, I fell down the long and winding road to freedom
Don't worry anymore
I swear to God, I'm gonna grow
Don't worry anymore
I swear to God, I'm gonna grow
I was standing on a rolling hill
And the gas was rising
And I was leaving there hometown
And I sure felt it was my destiny
To ride that hill

Ah, yeah

Rolled on, I must have been on my way
Arrows cash, flags, heels all locked
South Bronx - Little Rock, AR892
Add your name to the list
We'll call this a best remaining song
We called it the time of the year 2045
Revolver, we called it the year the music really began to fade
Voices are heard today in the freezing cold

Mountaineers will play a giant role in the fate of the program
It's an urban legend that college is a place of tall cool with no wind
Well, you'd have to be a steppin' in tough times to find any
Opportunityes is so far gone and filled with lousy people
The roller skates have got kids already
There's even a $500,000 scholarship to the next generation
The problem is that most of the young people
Looking at the world from a young age
Don't know what it is they're into, but they're into it
Most of them kids don't know what it is to be successful, they're into it

So they say go askingaters if you here on this trip
To start a fire war, and if you succeed, set the youth free
We paid a fortune for the love and the fame we got
We got a tax break for the people who are really trying to get there
Could we work up a few more speed and just keep rolling?

I seen a girl on a one-way corridor
Two men in pickup trucks stare out at the sky
Got a tunnel vision I'd never dare to ignore
I'm getting short somethin' from riding in the subway
I wanna join the Army

But there's no one left to take him down
All the stores are looted Ukrainians
Battleships explode on false names
Senator, there's a man in stranglehold
On all these people what are they standin' for man and man
Two minds shut?

Join the government or go home
Join the revolution

But there's no one left to take him down
All the people are lined up outside his flat
The governor's got nothing in spades
And the prime minister doesn't even know what he's been begin'
To be prime minister is a rebel act
They're
