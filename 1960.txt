Like sweet morning dew
I took one look at you
And it was plain to see
You were my destiny

With my arms open wide
I threw away my pride
I'll sacrifice for you
Dedicate my life to you
I will go where you lead
Always there in time of need

And when I lose my will
You'll be there to push me up the hill

There's no, no looking back for us
We got love sure 'nough, that's enough
You're all, You're all I need to get by

Like an eagle protects his nest, for you I'll do my best
Stand by you like a tree, dare anybody to try and move me
Darling in you I found
Strength where I was torn down
Don't know what's in store but together we can open any door
Just to do what's good for you and inspire you a little higher

I know you can make a man out of a soul that didn't have a goal

Cause we, we got the right foundation and with love and determination
You're all, you're all I want to strive for and do a little more
You're all the joys under the sun wrapped up into one
You're all I need, you're all I need, you're all I need to get by

Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

Hey Jude, don't be afraid
You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better

And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder
Na na na na na na na na na na

Hey Jude, don't let me down
You have found her, now go and get her
(Let it out and let it in)
Remember (Hey Jude) to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better
So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin
You're waiting for someone to perform with
And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do
The movement you need is on your shoulder
Na na na na na na na na na yeah

Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better

I see a red door and I want it painted black
No colours anymore, I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

I see a line of cars and they're all painted black
With flowers and my love, both never to come back
I see people turn their heads and quickly look away
Like a newborn baby, it just happens every day

I look inside myself and see my heart is black
I see my red door, I must have it painted black
Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts
It's not easy facing up when your whole world is black

No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue
I could not foresee this thing happening to you
If I look hard enough into the setting sun
My love will laugh with me before the morning comes

I see a red door and I want it painted black
No colours anymore, I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

I wanna see your face, painted black
Black as night, black as coal
I wanna see the sun blotted out from the sky
I wanna see it painted, painted, painted, painted black
Yeah

***************

Let me tell you about a place
Somewhere up a New York way
Where the people are so gay
Twisting the night away
Here they have a lot of fun
Putting trouble on the run
Man, you find the old and young
Twisting the night away
They're twisting, twisting
Everybody's feeling great
They're twisting, twisting
They're twisting the night away
Here's a man in evening clothes
How he got here, I don't know, but
Man, you oughta see him go
Twisting the night away
He's dancing with a chick in slacks
She's moving up and back
Oh, man, there ain't nothing like
Twisting the night away
They're twisting, twisting
Everybody's feeling great
They're twisting, twisting
They're twisting the night
Let's twist a while
Lean up
Lean back
Lean up
Lean back
Watusi
Now fly
Now twist
They're twisting the night away
Here's a fella in blue jeans
Dancing with an older queen
Who's dolled up in her diamond rings and
Twisting the night away
Man, you oughta see her go
Twisting to the rock and roll
Here you find the young and old
Twisting the night away
They're twisting, twisting, man
Everybody's feeling great
They're twisting, twisting
They're twisting the night
One more time
Lean up
Lean back
Lean up
Lean back
Watusi
Now fly
Now twist

This magic moment
So different and so new
Was like any other
Until I kissed you
And then it happened
It took me by suprise
I knew that you felt it too
By the look in your eyes
Sweeter than wine
Softer than the summer night
Everything I want I have
Whenever I hold you tight
This magic moment
While you lips are close to mine
Will last forever
Forever til the end of time
Oh...
Oh...
Mm...
Sweeter than wine
Softer than the summer night
Everything I want I have
Whenever I hold you tight
This magic moment
While your lips are close to mine
Will last forever
Forever til the end of time
Oh...
Magic moment...
Magic moment...
Magic moment...

Wouldn't it be nice if we were older?
Then we wouldn't have to wait so long
And wouldn't it be nice to live together
In the kind of world where we belong?
You know it's gonna make it that much better
When we can say goodnight and stay together

Wouldn't it be nice if we could wake up
In the morning when the day is new?
After having spent the day together
Hold each other close the whole night through

But happy times together we've been spending
I wish that every kiss was never-ending
Oh, wouldn't it be nice?

Maybe if we think and wish and hope and pray, it might come true
Oh, baby, then there wouldn't be a single thing we couldn't do
Oh, we could be married (Oh, we could be married)
And then we'd be happy (And then we'd be happy)
Oh, wouldn't it be nice?
You know it seems the more we talk about it
It only makes it worse to live without it
But let's talk about it
But wouldn't it be nice?

Goodnight, my baby
Sleep tight, my baby
Goodnight, my baby
Sleep tight, my baby
Goodnight, my baby
Sleep tight, my baby

And they called it puppy love
Oh I guess they'll never know
How a young heart, how it really feels
And why I love her so
And they called it puppy love
Just because we're seventeen
Tell them all it, please tell them it isn't fair
To take away my only dream
I cry each night
My tears for you
My tears are all in vain
I hope, I hope and I pray
That maybe someday
You'll be back (you'll be back) in my arms (in my arms)
Once again (Will be back in my arms once again)
Someone help me, help me please
Is the answer up above?
How can I, oh how can I tell them?
This is not a puppy love
(This is not a puppy love)
Someone help me, help me please
Is the answer up above?
How can I, oh how can I ever tell them?
This is not a puppy love
(This is not a puppy love)

Stars shining bright above you
Night breezes seem to whisper, I love you
Birds singin' in the sycamore trees
Dream a little dream of me

Say nighty-night and kiss me
Just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me
While I'm alone and blue as can be
Dream a little dream of me

Stars fading but I linger on dear
Still craving your kiss
Now I'm longin' to linger till dawn dear
Just saying this

Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you
Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you
But in your dreams whatever they be
Dream a little dream of me

Stars fading but I linger on dear
Still craving your kiss
I'm longin' to linger till dawn dear
Just saying this
Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you
Leave the worries behind you
But in your dreams, whatever may be
You've gotta make me a promise, promise to me
You'll dream, dream a little dream of me

Something told me it was over
When I saw you and her talking
Something deep down in my soul said, "Cry Girl"
When I saw you and that girl, walking around
I would rather, I would rather go blind boy
Than to see you walk away from me child, and all
So you see, I love you so much
That I don't want to watch you leave me baby
Most of all, I just don't, I just don't want to be free no
I was just, I was just, I was just sitting here thinking
Of your kiss and your warm embrace, yeah
When the reflection in the glass that I held to my lips now baby
Revealed the tears that was on my face, yeah
And baby, And baby, I would rather, I would rather be blind boy
Than to see you walk away, see you walk away from me, yeah
Baby, baby, baby, I'd rather be blind now

Fly me to the moon
Let me play among the stars
And let me see what spring is like
On a-Jupiter and Mars

You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words, please be true
In other words, I love you

You're nobody til somebody loves you
You're nobody til somebody cares
You may be king, you may possess the world and it's gold
But gold won't bring you happiness when you're growing old
The world still is the same, you never change it
As sure as the stars shine above
You're nobody til somebody loves you
So find yourself somebody to love
The world still is the same, you never change it
As sure as the stars shine above
Well, you're nobody til somebody loves you
So find yourself somebody to love

At long last love has arrived
And I thank God I'm alive

Can't take my eyes off you

I love you, baby, and if it's quite alright
I need you, baby, to warm the lonely night

In a little cafe
Just the other side of the border
She was just sitting there givin' me looks
That made my mouth water
So I started walking her way
She belonged to bad man Jose
And I knew, yes I knew I should leave
When I heard her say, yeah
"Come a little bit closer
You're my kind of man
So big and so strong
Come a little bit closer
I'm all alone and the night is so long"
So we started to dance
In my arms, she felt so inviting
And I just couldn't resist
Just one little kiss, so exciting
Then I heard the guitar player say
"Vamos, Jose's on his way"
Then I knew, yes I knew I should run
But then I heard her say, yeah
"Come a little bit closer
You're my kind of man
So big and so strong
Come a little bit closer
I'm all alone and the night is so long"
Then the music stopped
When I looked the cafe was empty
Then I heard Jose say
"Man, you know you're in trouble plenty"
So I dropped my drink from my hand
And out through the window I ran
And as I rode away
I could hear her say to Jose, yeah
"Come a little bit closer
You're my kind of man
So big and so strong
Come a little bit closer
I'm all alone and the night is so long"
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
Wo oh ho
I still hear her say
I still hear her say

The leaves of brown
Came tumblin' down, remember
In September in the rain
The sun went out
Just like a dying ember
That September in the rain
To every word of love
I heard you whisper
The raindrops seemed to play
A sweet refrain
Though spring is here
To me it's still September
That September in the rain
To every word of love
I heard you whisper
The raindrops seemed to play
A sweet refrain
Though spring is here
To me it's still September
That September in the rain
That September in the rain

I'm a travelin' man
I've made a lot of stops all over the world
And in every part I own the heart
Of at least one lovely girl
I've a pretty señorita waiting for me
Down in old Mexico
If you're ever in Alaska stop and see
My cute little Eskimo
Oh my sweet fraulien down in Berlin town
Makes my heart start to yearn
And my China doll down in old Hong Kong
Waits for my return
Pretty Polynesian baby over the sea

When we walked in the sands of the Waikiki
And I held you oh so tight

I guess you'd say

And it's signed with love, just like it used to be

Walking through the park, it wasn't quite dark
There was a man sitting on a bench
Out of the crowd as his head lowly bowed
He just moaned and he made no sense
He'd just go
Um, um, um, um, um, um
Um, um, um, um, um, um
Um, um, um, um, um, um
Um, um, um, um, um, um
I just couldn't help myself
Yes, I was born with a curious mind
I asked this man just what did he mean
When he moaned if he'd be so kind
And he'd just go
Um, um, um, um, um, um
Um, um, um, um, um, um
Um, um, um, um, um, um
Um, um, um, um, um, um
Now that I've grown up
And the woman I love she has gone
Now that I'm a man, I think I understand
Sometimes everyone must sing this song
Listen to me sing
Um, um, um, um, um, um
Um, um, um, um, um, um
Um, um, um, um, um, um
Um, um, um, um, um, um
Can't you hear me, now
Um, um, um, um, um, um
Um, um, um, um, um, um
Um, um, um, um, um, um
Um, um, um, um, um, um
Everybody now
Um, um, um, um, um, um
Um, um, um, um, um, um
Um, um, um, um, um, um
Um, um, um, um, um, um
Can't you hear me, now
Um, um, um, um, um, um
Um, um, um, um, um, um
Um, um, um, um, um, um
Um, um, um, um, um, um
One more time, now

I don't like you
But I love you
Seems that I'm always
Thinking of you
Oh, oh, oh
You treat me badly
I love you madly

You've really got a hold on me
(You've really got a hold on me)
You've really got a hold on me
You've really got a hold on me, baby

I don't want you
But I need you
Don't want to kiss you
But I need to
Oh, oh, oh
You do me wrong now
My love is strong now

You've really got a hold on me

You've really got a hold on me

I love you and all I want you to do
Is just hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Tighter
Tighter

I want to leave you
Don't want to stay here
Don't want to spend another day here
Oh, oh, oh, I want to split now
I can't quit now

You've really got a hold on me

You've really got a hold on me
You've really got a hold on me, baby

I love you and all I want you to do
Is just hold me, please (Hold me)
Squeeze, hold me

Ya know, you've really got hold on me

You know, you've really got hold on me

Do you believe in magic in a young girl's heart
How the music can free her whenever it starts?
And it's magic if the music is groovy
It makes you feel happy like an old-time movie
I'll tell you about the magic, and it'll free your soul
But it's like tryna tell a stranger 'bout-a rock and roll

If you believe in magic, don't bother to choose
If it's jug band music or rhythm and blues
Just go and listen, and it'll start with a smile
That won't wipe off your face no matter how hard you try
Your feet start tapping, and you can't seem to find
How you got there so just blow your mind


If you believe in magic, come along with me
We'll dance until morning till there's just you and me
And maybe, if the music is right
I'll meet you tomorrow, sort of late at night
And we'll go dancing, baby, then you'll see
How the magic's in the music and the music's in me
Yeah
Do you believe in magic?
Yeah
Believe in the magic of the young girl's soul
Believe in the magic of-a rock and roll
Believe in the magic that can set you free
Ohh, talking 'bout the magic

(Do you believe like I believe?) Do you believe in magic?
(Do you believe like I believe?) Do you believe, believer?
(Do you believe like I believe?) Do you believe in magic?
(Do you believe like I believe?) Do you believe in magic?

***************

Maybe you want to give me kisses sweet
But only for one night with no repeat
And maybe you'd go away and never call
And a taste of honey is worse than none at all

Oh, little girl, in that case I don't want no part
That would only break my heart
Oh, but if you feel like loving me
If you got the notion
I second that emotion
Said, if you feel like giving me
A lifetime of devotion
I second that emotion

Maybe you think that love would tie you down
And you don't have the time to hang around
Maybe you think that love was made for fools
So it makes you wise to break the rules

Oh, little girl, in that case I don't want no part
That would only break my heart
Oh, but if you feel like loving me
If you got the notion
I second that emotion
Said, if you feel like giving me
A lifetime of devotion
I second that emotion
Oh, little girl, in that case I don't want no part
That would only break my heart
Oh, but if you feel like loving me
If you got the notion
I second that emotion
Said, if you feel like giving me
A lifetime of devotion
I second that emotion

The warmth of your love's like the warmth of the sun
And this will be our year, took a long time to come
Don't let go of my hand, now darkness has gone
This will be our year, took a long time to come
And I won't forget
The way you held me up when I was down
And I won't forget the way you said
"Darling I love you, you gave me faith to go on"
Now we're there and we've only just begun
This will be our year, took a long time to come
The warmth of your smile, smile for me, little one
And this will be our year, took a long time to come
You don't have to worry, all your worried days are gone
And this will be our year, took a long time to come
And I won't forget
The way you held me up when I was down
And I won't forget the way you said
"Darling I love you, you gave me faith to go on"
Now we're there and we've only just begun
This will be our year, took a long time to come
And this will be our year, took a long time to come

Uh-huh huh huh huh
Let me tell ya now
Uh-huh

When I had you to myself, I didn't want you around
Those pretty faces always made you stand out in a crowd
But someone picked you from the bunch, one glance was all it took
Now it's much too late for me to take a second look

Oh, baby, give me one more chance (To show you that I love you)
Won't you please let me (Back in your heart)
Oh, darlin', I was blind to let you go (Let you go, baby)
But now since I see you in his arms (I want you back)

Yes, I do now (I want you back)
Ooh, ooh, baby (I want you back)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (I want you back)
Na, na, na, na

Tryin' to live without your love is one long sleepless night
Let me show you, girl, that I know wrong from right
Every street you walk on I leave tear stains on the ground
Following the girl, I didn't even want around
Let me tell you now
Oh, baby, all I need is one more chance (To show you that I love you)
Won't you please let me (Back in your heart)
Oh, darlin', I was blind to let you go (Let you go, baby)
But now since I see you in his arms, uh-huh

A buh buh buh buh
A buh buh buh buh, all I want
A buh buh buh buh, all I need
A buh buh buh buh, all I want
A buh buh buh buh, all I need

Oh, just one more chance
To show you that I love you
Baby! Baby!
Baby! Baby!
Baby! Baby!
I want you back

Forget what happened then
I want you back

Let me live again
Oh baby, I was blind to let you go
But now since I see you in his arms
I want you back

Spare me of this cause

Gimme back what I lost

Oh baby I need one more chance ha
I tell ya that I love you
Oh! Oh! Oh! I want you back!

Where the boys are
Someone waits for me
A smiling face
A warm embrace
Two arms to hold me tenderly
Where the boys are
My true love will be
He's walking down some street in town
And I know he's looking there for me
In the crowd of a million people
I'll find my valentine
And then I'll climb to the highest steeple
And tell the world he's mine
Till he holds me
I'll wait impatiently
Where the boys are
Where the boys are
Where the boys are
Someone waits for me
Till he holds me
I'll wait impatiently
Where the boys are
Where the boys are
Where the boys are
Someone waits for me

They call me the wanderer
Yeah, the wanderer
I roam around, around, around

Oh well, there's Flo on my left arm and there's Mary on my right

Some things are meant to be

Take my hand, take my whole life, too
For I can't help falling in love with you

Sometimes I feel so happy
Sometimes I feel so sad
Sometimes I feel so happy
But mostly, you just make me mad
Baby, you just make me mad

Linger on your pale blue eyes
Linger on your pale blue eyes

Thought of you as my mountain top
Thought of you as my peak
Thought of you as everything
I've had but couldn't keep
I've had but couldn't keep

Linger on your pale blue eyes
Linger on your pale blue eyes

If I could make the world as pure
And strange as what I see
I'd put you in the mirror
I put in front of me
I put in front of me
Linger on your pale blue eyes
Linger on your pale blue eyes


Skip a life completely
Stuff it in a cup
She said, "Money is like us in time
It lies but can't stand up
Down for you is up"

Linger on your pale blue eyes
Linger on your pale blue eyes

It was good what we did yesterday
And I'll do it once again
The fact that you are married
Only proves you're my best friend
But it's truly, truly a sin

Linger on your pale blue eyes
Linger on your pale blue eyes

Away from home through no wish of my own
That's why I'm lonely, I'm Mr. Lonely
I wish that I could go back home

Letters, never a letter
I get no letters in the mail

I was working in the lab late one night
When my eyes beheld an eerie sight
For my monster from his slab began to rise
And suddenly to my surprise

He did the mash
He did the monster mash
The monster mash
It was a graveyard smash
He did the mash
It caught on in a flash
He did the mash
He did the monster mash

From my laboratory in the castle east
To the master bedroom where the vampires feast
The ghouls all came from their humble abodes
To get a jolt from my electrodes

They did the mash
They did the monster mash
The monster mash
It was a graveyard smash
They did the mash
It caught on in a flash
They did the mash
They did the monster mash
The zombies were having fun
The party had just begun
The guests included Wolf Man
Dracula and his son

The scene was rockin', all were digging the sounds
Igor on chains, backed by his baying hounds
And I, Zombina was about to arrive
With my vocal group, "The Skeletones"

They played the mash
They played the monster mash
The monster mash
It was a graveyard smash
They played the mash
It caught on in a flash
They played the mash
They played the monster mash

Out from his coffin, Drac's voice did ring
Seems he was troubled by just one thing
He opened the lid and shook his fist
And said, "Whatever happened to my Transylvania twist?"
It's now the mash
It's now the monster mash
The monster mash
And it's a graveyard smash
It's now the mash
It's caught on in a flash
It's now the mash
It's now the monster mash

Now everything's cool, Drac's a part of the band
And my monster mash is the hit of the land
For you, the living, this mash was meant too
When you get to my door, tell them Zombina sent you

Then you can mash
Then you can monster mash
The monster mash
And do my graveyard smash
Then you can mash
You'll catch on in a flash
Then you can mash
Then you can monster mash

Oh, she may be weary
And young girls they do get weary
Wearing that same old shaggy dress, yeah yeah
But when she gets weary
Try a little tenderness, yeah yeah
(Oh my, not)

You know she's waiting
Just anticipating
For things that she'll never, never, never, never
Possess, yeah yeah
But while she's there waiting, and without them
Try a little tenderness (That's all you gotta do)

It's not just sentimental, no, no, no
She has her grief and care, yeah yeah yeah
But the soft words, they are spoke so gentle, yeah
It makes it easier, easier to bear, yeah

You won't regret it, no, no
Some girls they don't forget it
Love is their own happiness, yeah
But it's all so easy
All you gotta do is try, try a little tenderness, yeah
All you gotta do is, man, hold her where you want her
Squeeze her, don't tease her, never leave her
Get to her, try, try
Just try a little tenderness, ooh yeah yeah yeah
You got to know how to love her, man, you'll be surprised, man
You've got to squeeze her, don't tease her, never leave
You've got to hold her and rub her softly
Try a little tenderness, ooh yeah yeah yeah
You've got to rub her gentle man, all you gotta do
Don't got, don't bruise her, no no
You've got to love her, tease her, don't squeeze her
Gotta try nah nah nah, try
Try a little tenderness, yeah, watch her groove
You've gotta to know what to do, man
Take this advice
You got to love, squeeze, don't tease my baby
Love her, no

Where it began
I can't begin to know when
But then I know it's growing strong
Was in the spring
And spring became the summer
Who'd have believed you'd come along

Hands, touchin' hands
Reachin' out, touchin' me, touchin' you

Sweet Caroline
Good times never seemed so good
I've been inclined
To believe they never would

But now I look at the night
And it don't seem so lonely
We fill it up with only two
And when I hurt
Hurtin' runs off my shoulders
How can I hurt when holdin' you
Warm, touchin' warm
Reachin' out, touchin' me, touchin' you

Sweet Caroline
Good times never seemed so good
I've been inclined
To believe they never would
Oh no no

Sweet Caroline
Good times never seemed so good
Sweet Caroline
I believe they never could

Good times never seemed so good

I've been out walking
I don't do too much talking these days
These days
These days I seem to think a lot
About the things that I forgot to do
And all the times I had
The chance to

I stopped my rambling
I don't do too much gambling these days
These days
These days I seem to think about
How all the changes came about my ways
And I wonder if I'd see another
Highway

I had a lover
I don't think I risk another these days
These days
And if I seem to be afraid
To live the life that I have made in song
It's just that I've been losing
So long
La-la-la-la-la
La-la
I'd stopped my dreaming
I won't do too much scheming these days
These days
These days I sit on cornerstones
And count the time in quarter tones to 10
Please don't confront me with my failures
I had not forgotten them

***************

Yeah, I'm gonna tell my tale come on, uh come on, give a listen

'Cause I was born lonely down by the riverside
Learned to spin fortune wheels and throw dice
I was just thirteen when I had to leave home
Knew I couldn't stick around, I had to roam

Ain't good lookin', but you know I ain't shy
Ain't afraid to look you girl, hey, in the eye
So if you need some lovin', and you need it right away
Take a little time out, and maybe I'll stay

But I got to ramble (Ramblin' man)
Gamble (Gamblin' man)
Got to, got to ramble (ramblin' man)
I was born a ramblin', gamblin' man
Yeah, uhh, say, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, hah, hah
A bring it on, come on now
Yeah, alright, here we go now

Now, I'm out of money, 'cause you know I need some
Ain't gonna run on lovin', and I must run
Got to keep movin', never gonna slow down
You can have your funky world, see you 'round
Cause I got to ramble (Ramblin' man)
I got to gamble (gamblin' man)
I got to ramble (ramblin' man)
Lord, I'm a ramblin', gamblin' man
Oh! I'm just a rambler
Yeah! and I'm just a gambler
Come on and sing along

Yo mom, who thought that this could happen

Nobody but me

Love is what we need
So if you get that, the blessing will proceed, so please give back

Coming at ya, mob deep on this song
And now it's on
Come together for born
Better yet form Voltron
Spread love like mustard, bust it, making knowledge be born
So trust it, it's B-D-K, learn to love it
(Chorus)
What the world needs now is love sweet love

I know just exactly what world needs now, plead it
Everybody come show a little love for your family, Jesus we need it   And
Even when I flip through the pages of my history
Slowly reveal the mystery
Got to get it together quickly, in this industry
Lord, we don't need another mountain
There are mountains and hillsides enough to climb
There are oceans and rivers enough to cross
Enough to last till the end of time

Yo, yo, yo
I could see far and beyond, me and my auntie Dionne
With the homie Fazon, who's cool as freon
As the music plays on, portrays and stays on
Got this thing together, got to get our game together
Life is life and if your ears are open
You could see when you scope doors closed or open
Whether you're in or you're out
You're always in and that's for sure
And that's what friends are for, for what the world needs
 (Chorus)
What the world needs now is love sweet love
What the world needs now

Lord, we don't need another meadow
There are cornfields and wheat fields enough to grow
There are sunbeams and monnbeams enough to shine
Listen Lord, if you want to know
Give me this drug, they call it love
I'd pump it off around the world
To touch the soul of every man, woman, child, boy and girl

I pray that we could live together on this family tree
Royal Flush and Mic G, we want the world to see

What's happening
Is the matter when the people traveling
To grasp a pen and pad and then this united gathering
Keep it on the love, love if you expect the vibe
Work it out just like an exercise, shame of
 (Chorus)
What the world needs now is love, sweet love
What the world needs no
Come on can we have unity
Just a little bit of unity, brother
Just a little bit, just a little bit of love baby

L is for the lies that they told and the lines that they crossed
When they burglarized my soul, they cold
O is for the outsiders looking in, times is looking grim
You can't even trust your friends, damn
V, cause it's very necessary
That various policies get variated and eradicated, I hate it
E is for the extra mile you had to walk
Just to talk to your homie who was locing
And to show him you have love for him
What the world needs now is love sweet love
What the world needs now
It's the only thing that there's just too little of

We humbly gather together united with almighty power
Ready to rumble at any hour
Got love and it won't let me stumble, follow me

What the world needs now is love sweet love
What the world needs now
 (Fades out)
Can we get together, I'm on my way, baby
Come on get together, unity
We can unify the hip-hop nation

Why does the sun go on shining?
Why does the sea rush to shore?
Don't they know it's the end of the world?
'Cause you don't love me any more

Why do the birds go on singing?
Why do the stars glow above?
Don't they know it's the end of the world?
It ended when I lost your love

I wake up in the morning and I wonder
Why everything's the same as it was
I can't understand, no, I can't understand
How life goes on the way it does

Why does my heart go on beating?
Why do these eyes of mine cry?
Don't they know it's the end of the world?
It ended when you said goodbye

Why does my heart go on beating?
Why do these eyes of mine cry?
Don't they know it's the end of the world?
It ended when you said goodbye

People get ready, there's a train a-comin'
You don't need no baggage, you just get on board
All you need is faith to hear the diesels hummin'
Don't need no ticket, you just thank the Lord

So, people get ready for the train to Jordan
Picking up passengers coast to coast
Faith is the key, open the doors and board 'em
There's hope for all among those loved the most
There ain't no room for the hopeless sinner
Who would hurt all mankind just to save his own, believe me now
Have pity on those whose chances grow thinner
For there's no hiding place against the kingdom's throne

So, people get ready, there's a train a-comin'
You don't need no baggage, you just get on board
All you need is faith to hear the diesels hummin'
Don't need no ticket, you just thank the Lord

One is the loneliest number that you'll ever do
Two can be as bad as one
It's the loneliest number since the number one

No is the saddest experience you'll ever know
Yes, it's the saddest experience you'll ever know
'Cause one is the loneliest number that you'll ever do
One is the loneliest number, whoa-oh, worse than two

It's just no good anymore since you went away
Now I spend my time just making rhymes of yesterday

One is the loneliest number
One is the loneliest number
One is the loneliest number that you'll ever do
One is the loneliest

My cherie amour, lovely as a summer day
My cherie amour, distant as the milky way
My cherie amour, pretty little one that I adore
You're the only girl my heart beats for
How I wish that you were mine
In a cafe or sometimes on a crowded street
I've been near you, but you never noticed me
My cherie amour, won't you tell me how could you ignore
That behind that little smile I wore
How I wish that you were mine

La la la la la la
La la la la la la

Maybe someday, you'll see my face among the crowd
Maybe someday, I'll share your little distant cloud
Oh, cherie amour, pretty little one that I adore
You're the only girl my heart beats for
How I wish that you were mine

In the cool of the evening
When everything is gettin' kind of groovy
You call me up and ask me
Would I like to go with you and see a movie
First I say no, I've got some plans for the night
And then I stop
And say "all right"
Love is kinda crazy with a spooky little boy like you

You always keep me guessin'
I never seem to know what you are thinking
And if a girl looks at you
It's for sure your little eye will be a-winkin'
I get confused, I never know where I stand
And then you smile
And hold my hand
Love is kinda crazy with a spooky little boy like you
Spooky

If you decide someday to stop this little game that you are playing
I'm gonna tell you all the things my heart's been a-dyin' to be saying
Just like a ghost you've been a-hauntin' my dreams
But now I know
You're not what you seem
Love is kinda crazy with a spooky little boy like you
Spooky, spooky, oh whoa, all right
Spooky, oh yea yea
I said Spooky yea yea

Well he walked up to me
And he asked me if I wanted to dance
He looked kind of nice
And so I said I might take a chance
When he danced he held me tight
And when he walked me home that night
All the stars were shining bright
And then he kissed me
Each time I saw him
I couldn't wait to see him again
I wanted to let him know
That he was more than a friend
I didn't know just what to do
So I whispered "I love you"
And he said that he loved me too
And then he kissed me
He kissed me in a way that I've never been kissed before
Kissed me In a way that I want to be kissed forever more
I knew that he was mine
So I gave him all the love that I had
And one day he took me home
To meet his Mom and his Dad
Then he asked me to be his bride
And always be right by his side
I felt so happy I almost cried
And then he kissed me
Then he asked me to be his bride
And always be right by his side
I felt so happy I almost cried
And then he kissed me
And then he kissed me
And then he kissed me

I'm goin' up the country, baby, don't you wanna go?
I'm goin' up the country, baby, don't you wanna go?
I'm goin' to someplace where I've never been before

I'm goin', I'm goin' where the water tastes like wine
I'm goin' where the water tastes like wine
We can jump in the water, stay drunk all the time


I'm gonna leave the city, got to get away
I'm gonna leave the city, got to get away
All this fussin' and fightin', man, you know I sure can't stay

Now, baby, pack your leavin' trunk, you know we've got to leave today
Just exactly where we're goin' I cannot say, but
We might even leave the USA
'Cause there's a brand new game and I don't wanna play


No use for you runnin' or screamin' and cryin'
'Cause you've got a home as long as I've got mine

Oh, when the sun beats down
And burns the tar up on the roof
And your shoes get so hot
You wish your tired feet were fireproof
Under the boardwalk
Down by the sea
On a blanket with my baby
Is where I'll be

(Under the boardwalk) Out of the sun
(Under the boardwalk) We'll be havin' some fun
(Under the boardwalk) People walking above
(Under the boardwalk) We'll be making love
Under the boardwalk, boardwalk

From the park you hear
The happy sound of a carousel
Mmm, you can almost taste
The hot dogs and French fries they sell
Under the boardwalk
Down by the sea, yeah
On a blanket with my baby
Is where I'll be
(Under the boardwalk) Out of the sun
(Under the boardwalk) We'll be havin' some fun

The loveliness of Paris seems somehow sadly gay
The glory that was Rome is of another day
I've been terribly alone and forgotten in Manhattan
I'm going home to my city by the Bay
I left my heart in San Francisco
High on a hill, it calls to me
To be where little cable cars climb halfway to the stars
The morning fog may chill the air, I don't care
My love waits there in San Francisco
Above the blue and windy sea
When I come home to you, San Francisco
Your golden sun will shine for me

Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
Baby, I need your loving.  (I really need you.)
Baby, I need your loving.  (I really need you.)
Although you're never near, (I really need you.)
Your voice I often hear.  (I really need you.)
Another day, another night, (I really need you.)
I long to hold you tight, (I really need you.)
'Cause I'm so lonely
Baby, I need your loving
Got to have all your loving
Baby, I need your loving
Got to have all your loving
Some say it's a sign of weakness for a man to beg
Than weak, I'd rather be
If it means having you to keep
'Cause lately I've been losing sleep
Baby, I need your loving
Got to have all your loving
Baby, I need your loving
Got to have all your loving
Empty nights echo your name
(Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh.)
Whoa, sometimes I wonder
(Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh.)
Will I ever be the same
(Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh.)
Oh yeah
(Baby, baby,) When you see me smiling, you know
(I need you and I want you, baby.)
Things have gotten worse.  (And I need you and I love you, baby.)
Any smile you might see (And I need you and I want you, baby.)
Has all been rehearsed.  (And I need you and I love you, baby.)
Darling, I can't go on with you.  (And I need you and I want you, baby.)
This emptiness won't let me live without you
(And I need you and I love you, baby.)
This loneliness inside me, darling, (And I need you and I want you, baby.)
Makes me feel half alive.  (And I need you and I...)
Baby, I need your loving
Got to have all your loving
Baby, I need your loving
Got to have all your loving
Baby, I need your loving
Got to have all your loving

Seems like the other day
My baby went away
He went away 'cross the sea
It's been two years or so
Since I saw my baby go
And then this letter came for me
It said that we were through
He found somebody new
Oh, let me think, let me think, what can I do?

Oh no
Oh no
Oh no no no no no

(Remember) walkin' in the sand
(Remember) walkin' hand in hand
(Remember) the night was so exciting
(Remember) smile was so inviting
(Remember) then he touched my cheek
(Remember) with his fingertips
Softly, softly we'd meet with our lips

Whatever happened to
The boy that I once knew?
The boy who said he'd be true
Oh, what will happen to
The life I gave to you?
What will I do with it now?
(Remember) walkin' in the sand
(Remember) walkin' hand in hand
(Remember) the night was so exciting
(Remember) smile was so inviting
(Remember) then he touched my cheek
(Remember) with his fingertips
(Remember) softly

(Remember)
(Remember)
(Remember)
(Remember)
Walkin' in the sand
(Remember)
Walkin' hand in in hand

Sometimes I'm right and I can be wrong
My own beliefs are in my song
The butcher, the banker, the drummer and then
Makes no difference what group I'm in

I am everyday people, yeah, yeah

There is a blue one who can't accept the green one
For living with a fat one, trying to be a skinny one
And different strokes for different folks
And so on and so on and scooby dooby doo-bee

Ooh, sha sha
We got to live together

I am no better and neither are you
We are the same whatever we do
You love me, you hate me, you know me and then
You can't figure out the bag I'm in

I am everyday people, yeah, yeah
There is a long hair that doesn't like the short hair
For being such a rich one, that will not help the poor one
And different strokes for different folks
And so on and so on and scooby dooby doo-bee

Ooh, sha sha
We got to live together

There is a yellow one that won't accept the black one
That won't accept the red one, that won't accept the white one
Different strokes for different folks
And so on and so on and scooby dooby doo-bee

Ooh, sha sha
I am everyday people

Purple haze all in my brain
Lately things, they don't seem the same
Acting funny, but I don't know why
'Scuse me while I kiss the sky

Purple haze all around
Don't know if I'm coming up or down
Am I happy or in misery?
Whatever it is, that girl put a spell on me
Help me! Help me!
Ah no, no

Yeah! Purple haze all in my eyes
Don't know if it's day or night
You got me blowing, blowing my mind
Is it tomorrow, or just the end of time?
No, help me
No, yeah purple haze
Oh no, no
Oh, help me
Tell me, tell me
Can't go on like this
You make me blow my mind
No, no, no
No, no, purple haze

Shit, tired of gettin' shot at
Tired of gettin' chased by the police and arrested
Niggas need a spot where we can kick it
A spot where we belong, that's just for us
Niggas ain't gotta get all dressed up and be Hollywood
Y'knahmean? Where do niggas go when we die?
Ain't no heaven for a thug nigga
That's why we go to thug mansion
That's the only place where thugs get in free
And you gotta be a G, at thug mansion
A place to spend my quiet nights, time to unwind
So much pressure in this life of mine
I cry at times, I once contemplated suicide
And would've tried, but when I held that 9
All I could see was my mama's eyes
No one knows my struggle, they only see the trouble
Not knowin' it's hard to carry on when no one loves you
Picture me inside the misery of poverty
No man alive has ever witnessed struggles I survived
Prayin' hard for better days, promise to hold on
Me and my dogs ain't have a choice but to roll on
We found a family spot to kick it
Where we can drink liquor and no one bickers over trick shit
A spot where we can smoke in peace and even though we G's
We still visualize places that we can roll in peace
And in my mind's eye I see this place, the players go and pass it
I got a spot for us all so we can ball at thug's mansion
Every corner, every city
There's a place where life's a little easy
Little Hennessy, laid back and cool
Every hour, ‘cause it's all good
Leave all the stress from the world outside
Every wrong done will be alright (I wanna go)
Nothing but peace, love
And street passion (I wanna go, nigga)
Every ghetto needs a thug mansion

A place where death doesn't reside, just thugs who collide
Not to start beef but spark trees, no cops rollin' by
No policemen, no homicide, no chalk on the streets
No reason for nobody's mama to cry
See, I'm a good guy, I'm tryin' to stick around for my daughter
But if I should die, I know all of my albums support her
This whole year's been crazy, asked the Holy Spirit to save me
Only difference from me and Ossie Davis, gray hair maybe
‘Cause I feel like my eyes saw too much sufferin'
I'm just 20-some-odd years, I done lost my mother and I cried tears of joy
I know she smiles on her boy
I dream of you more, my love goes to Afeni Shakur
‘Cause, like Ann Jones, she raised a ghetto king in a war
And just for that alone she shouldn't feel no pain no more
‘Cause one day we'll all be together, sippin' heavenly champagne
Where angels soar with golden wings, in thug's mansion
Every corner, every city
There's a place where life's a little easy
Little Hennessy, laid back and cool
Every hour, ‘cause it's all good (at thugs's mansion)
Leave all the stress from the world outside
Every wrong done will be alright
Nothing but peace, love and street passion
Every ghetto needs a thug mansion
Dear mama, don't cry, your baby boy's doin' good
Tell the homies I'm in Heaven and they ain't got hoods
Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night, it had me shook
Drinkin' peppermint Schnapps with Jackie Wilson and Sam Cooke
Then some lady named Billie Holiday sang
Sittin' there kickin' it with Malcolm 'til the day came
Little Latasha sure grown
Tell the lady in the liquor store that she's forgiven, so come home
Maybe in time you'll understand only God can save us
When Miles Davis cuttin' lose with the band
Just think of all the people that you knew in the past
That passed on, they in Heaven, found peace at last
Picture a place that they exist together
There has to be a place better than this in Heaven
So right before I sleep, dear God, what I'm askin'
Remember this face, save me a place in thug's mansion
Every corner, every city
There's a place where life's a little easy
(At thugs's mansion)
Little Hennessy, laid back and cool
Every hour, ‘cause it's all good
Leave all the stress from the world outside
Every wrong done will be alright
Nothing but peace, love and street passion
Every ghetto needs a thug mansion
