NUMBER OF SONGS FOUND55

You know I can be found
Sitting home all alone
If you can't come around
At least please telephone
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true

Baby, if I made you mad
For something I might have said
Please, let's forget the past
The future looks bright ahead
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true
I don't want no other love
Baby, it's just you I'm thinking of

Don't stop thinking of me
Don't make me feel this way
C'mon over here and love me
You know what I want you to say
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true
Why should we be apart?
I really love you, baby, cross my heart

Let's walk up to the preacher
And let us say "I do"
Then you'll know you'll have me
And I'll know that I'll have you
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true
I don't want no other love
Baby, it's just you I'm thinking of
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true
I don't want no other love
Baby, it's just you I'm thinking of

My story is much to sad to be told
But practically everything leaves me totally cold
The only exception I know is the case
When Im out on a quiet spree, fighting vainly the old ennui
Then I suddenly turn and see
Your fabulous face
I get no kick from champagne
Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all
So tell me why should it be true
That I get a kick out of you
Some, they may go for cocaine
I'm sure that if I took even one sniff
It would bore me terrifically, too
Yet I get a kick out of you
I get a kick every time I see you
Standing there before me
I get a kick though it's clear to see
You obviously don't adore me
I get no kick in a plane
Flyin' too high with some gal in the sky is my idea of nothing to do
Yet I get a kick
You give me a boot
I get a kick out of you

***************

Heavenly shades of night are falling
It's twilight time
Out of the mist your voice is calling
'Tis twilight time
When purple colored curtains
Mark the end of day
I'll hear you my dear at twilight time
Deepening shadows gather splendor
As day is done
Fingers of night will soon surrender
The setting sun
I count the moments darling
'Till you're here with me
Together at last at twilight time
Here in the afterglow of day
We keep our rendezvous beneath the blue
Here in the sweet and same old way
I fall in love again as I did then
Deep in the dark your kiss will thrill me
Like days of old
Lighting the spark of love that fills me
With dreams untold
Each day I pray for evening just
To be with you
Together at last at twilight time
Here in the afterglow of day
We keep our rendezvous beneath the blue
Here in the sweet and same old way
I fall in love again as I did then
Deep in the dark your kiss will thrill me
Like days of old
Lighting the spark of love that fills me
With dreams untold
Each day I pray for evening just
To be with you
Together at last at twilight time
Together at last at twilight time

***************

Let me tell you about a girl I know
She is my baby and she live next door
Every morning 'fore the sun comes up
She bring my coffee in my favorite cup
That's why I know, yes, I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so
When I'm in trouble and I have no friends
I know she'll go with me until the end
Everybody asks me how I know
I smile at them and say she told me so
That's why I know, oh, I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so
Now if I call her on the telephone
And tell her that I'm all alone
By the time I count from one to four
I hear her on my door
In the evening when the sun goes down
When there is nobody else around
She kisses me and she hold me tight
And tell me "Daddy, everything's all right"
That's why I know, yes, I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so
Now if I call her on the telephone
And tell her that I'm all alone
By the time I count from one to four
I hear her on my door
In the evening when the sun goes down
When there is nobody else around
She kisses me and she hold me tight
And tell me "Daddy, everything's all right"
That's why I know, yes, I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so
Oh, hallelujah
Don't you know I just love her so
She's my little woman waiting across town
Baby, I'm a little fool for you girl

***************

Heaven, I'm in heaven
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek
Heaven, I'm in heaven
And the cares that hung around me through the week
Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak
When we're out together dancing (swinging) cheek to cheek
Oh I love to climb a mountain
And reach the highest peak
But it doesn't thrill (boot) me half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek
Oh I love to go out fishing
In a river or a creek
But I don't enjoy it half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek
Now Mamma Dance with me
I want my arm(s) about you
That (Those) charm(s) about you
Will carry me through...
(Right up) To heaven, I'm in heaven
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When we're out together dancing, out together dancing (swinging)
Out together dancing cheek to cheek

***************

Well, that'll be the day, when you say goodbye
Yes, that'll be the day, when you make me cry
You say you're going to leave, you know it's a lie
Because that'll be the day when I die

Well, you give me all your lovin' and your turtle dovin'
All your hugs and kisses and your money too
Well, you know you love me baby
Until you tell me, maybe
That someday, well I'll be through

Well, that'll be the day, when you say goodbye
Yes, that'll be the day, when you make me cry
You say you're going to leave, you know it's a lie
Because that'll be the day when I die
Well, that'll be the day, when you say goodbye
Yes, that'll be the day, when you make me cry
You say you're going to leave, you know it's a lie
Because that'll be the day when I die

Well, when Cupid shot his dart
He shot it at your heart
So if we ever part and I leave you
You sit and hold me and you tell me boldly
That someday, well I'll be blue
Well, that'll be the day, when you say goodbye
Yes, that'll be the day, when you make me cry
You say you're going to leave, you know it's a lie
Because that'll be the day when I die

Well, that'll be the day, hoo-hoo
That'll be the day, hoo-hoo
That'll be the day, hoo-hoo
That'll be the day

***************

I'm a fool to want you
I'm a fool to want you
To want a love that can't be true
A love that's there for others too
I'm a fool to hold you
Such a fool to hold you
To seek a kiss not mine alone
To share a kiss the Devil has known
Time and time again I said I'd leave you
Time and time again I went away
But then would come the time when I would need you
And once again these words I'd have to say
I'm a fool to want you
Pity me, I need you
I know it's wrong, it must be wrong
But right or wrong I can't get along without you
I can't get along without you

***************

My funny valentine
Sweet comic valentine
You make me smile with my heart
Your looks are laughable
Unphotographable
Yet you're my favorite work of art
Is your figure less than Greek
Is your mouth a little weak
When you open it to speak
Are you smart
But don't change a hair for me
Not if you care for me
Stay, little valentine, stay
Each day is Valentine's Day

***************

Put your head on my shoulder
Hold me in your arms, baby
Squeeze me oh so tight
Show me that you love me too

Put your lips next to mine, dear
Won't you kiss me once, baby
Just a kiss goodnight, maybe
You and I will fall in love
(You and I will fall in love)

People say that love's a game
A game you just can't win
If there's a way
I'll find it someday
And then this fool will rush in

Put your head on my shoulder
Whisper in my ear, baby
Words I want to hear
Tell me, tell me that you love me too
(Tell me that you love me too)
Put your head on my shoulder
Whisper in my ear, baby
Words I want to hear, baby
Put your head on my shoulder

If every time it rains, it rains, pennies from heaven (Shubby Dobby)
Don't you know each cloud contains pennies from heaven (Shubby Dobby)
You'll find your fortune falling all over town
Each red and yella umbrella is up up up up upside down and...
Trade them all for a pack of a gum, sunshine and ravioli (Macaroni)
If you want the thing you love, you must have a pizzioli baby
And when you hear thunder don't run under a tree
It be pennies from heaven, for you and for me
Now come over here boy, Sam
And every time it rains it rains
And don't you know each cloud contains
Every time it rains, it rains
And don't you know each cloud contains
You find your fortune falling
All over town, all over town, all over town
Each red and yella umbrella
Is upside down twiddily bop
A ha ba hozzie white
Eagle eye la homba lee
Zombalomba zompolot
Old wodilly boy oh
Ahhh bobba hoy boy
Ohhhh boy a hoy boy

Let's go, let's go
And you'll find your fortune falling all over town
It be pennies from heaven
Pennies from heaven
The pennies from heaven
For you and me

There's a place where lovers go
To cry their troubles away
And they call it Lonesome Town
Where the broken hearts stay

You can buy a dream or two
To last you all through the years
And the only price you pay
Is a heart full of tears

Goin' down to Lonesome town
Where the broken hearts stay
Goin' down to Lonesome town
To cry my troubles away

In the town of broken dreams
The streets are filled with regret
Maybe down in Lonesome Town
I can learn to forget (To forget)

Maybe down in Lonesome Town
I can learn to forget
(Lonesome Town)

Br-oooo-ken hearted me-eee-lo-dy
Ooooonce you were our song of love
Nooooow you just keep taunting me
Wiiiiith the memory of (ba-da-da)
His tender love. Ooooh
Broken hearted melody
Must you keep reminding me
Of the lips I long to kiss
And the love I miss since he went away
Night and day they play
That broken hearted melody
That he used to sing to me
When our love was young and bright
As he held me tight
Suddenly I found, I was heaven bound
Brooooken hearted melody
Ooooonce you were our song of love
Nooooow you just keep taunting me
Wiiiiiith the memory of (ba-da-da)
His tender love, Ooooh
Broken hearted melody
Won't you bring him back to me
Sing to him until he yearns
For when he returns no more will he be
A broken hearted melody
Oooooooo, oo-oo
Oo-oo, oo-oo, ooooooooo
Oooooooo, oo-oo
Oo-oo, oo-oo, ooooooooo

(Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun d-d-duh-duh-duh)
 know why I love you like I do (D-d-dun d-d-dah),  know why I do
(D-duh)
Don't know why I love you, don't know why I care
I just want, your love to share
I wonder why, I love you like I do
Is it because I think you love me too?
I wonder why, I love you like I do, like I do
I told my friends that we would never part
They often said that you would break my heart
I wonder why they think that we will part, we will part
When you're with me, I'm sure you're always true
When I'm away, I wonder what you do
I wonder why I'm sure you're always true, always true
Don't know why I do
(The d-duns, d-dahs, and doo-wops continue throughout the song both upfront and in the background so mentally fill them in for yourself, thank you)

Chances are, 'cause I wear a silly grin
The moment you come into view
Chances are you think that I'm in love with you
Just because my composure sort of slips
The moment that your lips meet mine
Chances are you think my heart's your valentine
In the magic of moonlight
When I sigh, "Hold me close, dear"
Chances are you'll believe the stars
That fill the skies are in my eyes
Guess you feel you'll always be
The one and only one for me
And if you think you could
Well, chances are your chances are awfully good
Chances are you'll believe the stars
That fill the skies are in my eyes
Guess you feel you'll always be
The one and only one for me
And if you think you could
Well, chances are your chances are awfully good
The chances are your chances are awfully good

Stars shining bright above you
Night breezes seem to whisper, "I love you."
Birds singing in the sycamore trees
Dream a little dream of me
Say, "Nightie-night" and kiss me
Just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me
While I'm alone and blue as can be
Dream a little dream of me
Stars fading but I linger on, dear
Still craving your kiss
I'm longing to linger till dawn, dear
Just saying this
"Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you
Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you
But in your dreams whatever they be
Dream a little dream of me"
Stars fading but I linger on, dear
Still craving your kiss
I'm longing to linger till dawn, dear
Just saying this
"Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you
Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you
But in your dreams whatever they be
Dream a little dream of me"

Happy birthday, happy birthday, baby
Oh, I love you so
Sixteen candles make a lovely light
But not as bright as your eyes tonight (as your eyes tonight) (Oh)
Blow out the candles, make your wish come true
For I'll be wishing that you love me, too (that you love me, too)
You're only sixteen (sixteen)
But you're my teenage queen (you're my queen)
You're the prettiest, loveliest girl I've ever seen (I've ever seen) (OH!)
Sixteen candles in my heart will glow
For ever and ever for I love you so (for I love you so)
You're only sixteen (sixteen)

Oh, you're the prettiest, loveliest girl I've ever seen (I've ever seen)
Sixteen candles in my heart will glow
For ever and ever for I love you so (for I love you so)
For I love you so!

I've got a man who's always late
Any time we have a date
But I love him
Yes, I love him
I'm gonna walk up to his gate
See if I can get this thing straight
'Cause I want him
And I'm gonna have him
Say is you is, or is you ain't my baby
The way you're acting lately makes me doubt
Youse is still my baby, baby
It seems my flame in your heart's done gone out
A man is a creature
That has always been strange
Just when you're sure of one
You'll find he's gone and made a change
Now, is you is or is you ain't my baby
Maybe baby's found somebody new
Or is my baby still my baby true
Now, is you is or is you ain't my baby
Maybe baby's found somebody new
Or is my baby still my baby true
I guess my baby's found somebody new
And I'd better get right up and go out and find me somebody, too
I said I'm gonna find me somebody, too

First a boy and a girl meet each other
Then they sit down to talk for a while
In your heart, you'll want her for a lover
While each step, draws you closer to the aisle
You may start with a simple conversation
My darling, please put me on trial
She says, yes and your heart starts beating
While each step, draws you closer to the aisle
You ask her if she loves you she answers, "I do"
Your heart starts glowing inside
And then you will know she is just for you
While each step, draws you closer to the aisle
Then you put a ring on her finger
And the tears start flowing awhile
Then you'll know she's yours forever
While each step, draws you closer to the aisle
She says, yes and your heart starts beating
While each step, draws you closer to the aisle

***************

You're mine
And we belong together
Yes, we belong together
For eternity
You're mine
Your lips belong to me
Yes, they belong to only me
For eternity
You're mine, my baby
And you'll always be
I swear by everything I own
You'll always, always be mine
You're mine
And we belong together
Yes, we belong together
For eternity

I was dancing with my darling to the Tennessee Waltz
When an old friend I happened to see
Introduced her to my loved one and while they were dancing
My friend stole my sweetheart from me
I remember the night and the Tennessee Waltz
Now I know just how much I have lost
Yes, I lost my little darling on the night they were playing
The beautiful Tennessee Waltz
I was dancing with my darling to the Tennessee Waltz
When an old friend I happened to see
Introduced her to my loved one and while they were dancing
My friend stole my sweetheart from me
I remember the night and the Tennessee Waltz
Now I know just how much I have lost
Yes, I lost my little darling on the night they were playing
The beautiful Tennessee Waltz

***************

See the pyramids along the Nile
Watch the sun rise on a tropic isle
Just remember, darling, all the while
You belong to me
See the marketplace in old Algiers
Send me photographs and souvenirs
Just remember when a dream appears
You belong to me
I'll be so alone without you
Maybe you'll be lonesome too, and blue
Fly the ocean in a silver plane
See the jungle when it's wet with rain
Just remember till you're home again
You belong to me
I'll be so alone without you
Maybe you'll be lonesome too, and blue
Fly the ocean in a silver plane
Watch the jungle when it's wet with rain
But remember darling, till you're home again
You belong to me

***************

Volare, oh oh
Cantare, oh oh oh oh
Let's fly way up to the clouds
Away from the maddening crowds
We can sing in the glow of a star that I know of
Where lovers enjoy peace of mind
Let us leave the confusion and all disillusion behind
Just like birds of a feather, a rainbow together we'll find
Volare, oh oh
E cantare, oh oh oh oh
No wonder my happy heart sings
Your love has given me wings
Penso che un sogno cosi non ritorni mai più
Mi dipingevo le mani e la faccia di blu
Poi d'improvviso venivo dal vento rapito
E incominciavo a volare nel cielo infinito
Volare, oh oh
E cantare, oh oh oh oh
Nel blu, dipinto di blu
Felice di stare lassù
E volavo, volavo felice piu in alto del sole ed ancora piu sù
Mentre il mondo pian piano spariva lontano laggiù
Una musica dolce suonava soltanto per me
Volare, oh oh
E cantare, oh oh oh oh
No wonder my happy heart sings
Your love has given me wings
Nel blu, dipinto di blu
Felice di stare lassù

***************

The night was clear
And the moon was yellow
And the leaves came tumbling down
I was standing on the corner
When I heard my bulldog bark
He was barking at the two men
Who were gambling in the dark
It was Stagger Lee and Billy
Two men who gambled late
Stagger Lee threw seven
Billy swore that he threw eight
Stagger Lee told Billy
"I can't let you go with that
You have won all my money
And my brand new Stetson hat."
Stagger Lee started off
Goin down that railroad track
He said, I can't get you Billy
But don't be here when I come back
Go on, Stagger Lee
Stagger Lee went home
And he got his .44
Said, "I'm going to the bar room
Just to pay that debt I owe."
Stagger Lee went to the bar room
And he stood across the bar room door
Said, "Now nobody move."
And he pulled his .44
"Stagger Lee," cried Billy
"Oh, please don't take my life
I got three little children
And a very sickly wife."
Stagger Lee shot Billy
Oh he shot that poor boy so bad
Till the bullet came through Billy
And it broke the bartender's glass
Now look out, Stagg, come on

Well I love, love you darlin'
Come and go with me
Come home with me
Way beyond the sea
I need you darlin'
So come and go with me
Come, come, come, come
Come into my heart
Tell me darlin'
We will never part
I need you darlin'

Take out the papers and the trash
Or you don't get no spendin' cash
If you don't scrub that kitchen floor
You ain't gonna rock and roll no more
Yakety yak (don't talk back)
Just finish cleanin' up your room
Let's see that dust fly with that broom
Get all that garbage out of sight
Or you don't go out Friday night
Yakety yak (don't talk back)
You just put on your coat and hat
And walk yourself to the laundromat
And when you finish doin' that
Bring in the dog and put out the cat
Yakety yak (don't talk back)
Don't you give me no dirty looks
Your father's hip; he knows what cooks
Just tell your hoodlum friend outside
You ain't got time to take a ride
Yakety yak (don't talk back)
Yakety yak, yakety yak
Yakety yak, yakety yak
Yakety yak, yakety yak
Yakety yak, yakety yak

***************

Unforgettable
That's what you are
Unforgettable
Tho' near or far

Like a song of love that clings to me
How the thought of you does things to me
Never before
Has someone been more...

Unforgettable
In every way
And forever more
That's how you'll stay

That's why, darling, it's incredible
That someone so unforgettable
Thinks that I am
Unforgettable, too

Unforgettable
In every way
And forever more
That's how you'll stay

That's why, darling, it's incredible
That someone so unforgettable
Thinks that I am
Unforgettable, too

My love must be a kind of blind love;
I can't see anyone but you
Sha bop sha bop
Sha bop sha bop
Sha bop sha bop
Sha bop sha bop
Are the stars out tonight
(Sha bop sha bop)
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright
(Sha bop sha bop)
I only have eyes for you, dear
(Sha bop sha bop)
(Sha bop sha bop)
The moon may be high
(Sha bop sha bop)
But I can't see a thing in the sky
(Sha bop sha bop)
I only have eyes for you
I don't know if we're in a garden
Or on a crowded avenue
(Sha bop sha bop)
You are here and so am I
Maybe millions of people go by
But they all disappear from view
And I only have eyes for you
(Sha bop sha bop)
(Sha bop sha bop)
(Sha bop sha bop)
(Sha bop sha bop)
(Sha bop sha bop)
(Sha bop sha bop)

Lonely, I'm Mr. Lonely
I have nobody for my own
I am so lonely, I'm Mr. Lonely
Wish I had someone to call on the phone

Now I'm a soldier, a lonely soldier
Away from home through no wish of my own
That's why I'm lonely, I'm Mr. Lonely
I wish that I could go back home

Letters, never a letter
I get no letters in the mail
I've been forgotten, yes, forgotten
Oh, how I wonder, how is it I failed

Now I'm a soldier, a lonely soldier
Away from home through no wish of my own
That's why I'm lonely, I'm Mr. Lonely
I wish that I could go back home

***************

I know I'd go from rages to riches
If you would only say you care
And though my pocket may be empty
I'd be a millionaire

My clothes may still be torn and tattered
But in my heart I'd be a king
Your love is all that ever mattered
It's everything

So open your arms and you'll open the door
To every treasure I'm hoping for
Hold me and kiss me and tell me you're mine evermore

Must I forever be a begger
Whose golden dreams will not come true
Or will I go from rags to riches
My fate is up to you

***************

Who's sorry now
Who's sorry now
Who's heart is aching for breaking each vow
Who's sad and blue
Who's crying too
Just like I cried over you
Right to the end
Just like a friend
I tried to warn you somehow
You had your way
Now you must pay
I'm glad that you're sorry now
Right to the end
Just like a friend
I tried to warn you somehow
You had your way
Now you must pay
I'm glad that you're sorry now

***************

You don't remember me, but I remember you
'twas not so long ago, you broke my heart in two
Tears on my pillow, pain in my heart, caused by you, you
If we could start anew, I wouldn't hesitate
I'd gladly take you back, and tempt the hand of fate
Tears on my pillow, pain in my heart, caused by you
Love is not a gadget, love is not a toy
When you find the one you love, she'll fill your heart with joy
If we could start anew, I wouldn't hesitate
I'd gladly take you back, and tempt the hands of fate
Tears on my pillow, pain in my heart, caused by you, you
Oh wo wo wo you you

Wo oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

***************

I wandered so aimless life filled with sin
I wouldn't let my dear savior in
Then Jesus came like a stranger in the night
Praise the Lord I saw the light

I saw the light I saw the light
No more darkness no more night
Now I'm so happy no sorrow in sight
Praise the Lord I saw the light

Just like a blind man I wandered along
Worries and fears I claimed for my own
Then like the blind man that God gave back his sight
Praise the Lord I saw the light

I saw the light I saw the light
No more darkness no more night
Now I'm so happy no sorrow in sight
Praise the Lord I saw the light

I was a fool to wander and a-stray
Straight is the gate and narrow the way
Now I have traded the wrong for the right
Praise the Lord I saw the light
I saw the light I saw the light
No more darkness no more night
Now I'm so happy no sorrow in sight
Praise the Lord I saw the light

***************

You made me cry
When you said, "good-bye"
Ain't that a shame?
My tears fell like rain
Ain't that a shame?
You're the one to blame

You broke my heart
When you said we'll part
Ain't that a shame?
My tears fell like rain
Ain't that a shame?
You're the one to blame

Oh, well, goodbye
Although I'll cry
Ain't that a shame?
My tears fell like rain
Ain't that a shame?
You're the one to blame

You made me cry
When you said, "good-bye"
Ain't that a shame?
My tears fell like rain
Ain't that a shame?
You're the one to blame

Oh well, goodbye
Although I'll cry
Ain't that a shame?
My tears fell like rain
Ain't that a shame?
You're the one to blame

Born too late for you to notice me
To you, I'm just a kid that you won't date
Why was I born too late?
Born too late to have a chance to win your love
Oh why, oh why was it my fate
To be born too late?
I see you walk with another
I wish it could be me
I long to hold you and kiss you
But I know it never can be
For I was
Born too late for you to care
Now my heart cries
Because your heart just couldn't wait
Why was I born too late?
Born too late for you to care
Now my heart cries
Because your heart just couldn't wait
Why was I born too la-a-a-a-ate?
Why was I born too late?
Too late

I'm going down in Louisiana
Be, be, behind the sun
I'm going down in Louisiana
Honey, behind the sun
Well, you know I just found out
My troubles just begun
I'm going down in New Orleans, hmm
Get me a mojo hand
I'm going down in New Orleans
Get me a mojo hand
Oh take me with you, man, when you going
I'm on show all you good looking women
Yes, how to treat your love
Let's go back to New Orleans

Summertime and the livin' is easy
Fish are jumpin' and the cotton is high
Yo' daddy's rich and yo' mama's good lookin'
So hush little baby, don't you cry
One of these mornin's you gonna rise up singin'
You gonna spread your little wings and you'll take to the sky
But 'till that mornin' there ain't nothin' gonna harm you
With yo mama and daddy standin' by
Now it's summertime and the livin' is easy
Them fish are jumpin' and the cotton's 'bout waist high
Yo' daddy's rich and, ya know yo' mama's good lookin'
Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Summertime
Ah, said it's summertime

Some people say a man is made out of mud
A poor man's made out of muscle and blood
Muscle and blood and skin and bones
A mind that's weak and a back that's strong

You load sixteen tons, what do you get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don't you call me, 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

I was born one morning when the sun didn't shine
I picked up my shovel and I walked to the mine
I loaded sixteen tons of number 9 coal
And the straw boss said, "Well-a bless my soul!"

You load sixteen tons, what do you get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don't you call me, 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

I was born one morning, it was drizzlin' rain
Fightin' and trouble are my middle name
I was raised in the cane brake by an old mama lion
Can't no high-toned woman make me walk the line
You load sixteen tons, what do you get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don't you call me, 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

If you see me comin' better step aside
A lot of men didn't, a lot of men died
One fist of iron, the other of steel
If the right one don't getcha then the left one will

You load sixteen tons, what do you get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don't you call me, 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

Once you get it, you never wanna quit (no, no)
After you've had it (yeah, yeah), you're in an awful fix
Many people don't understand (no, no)
They think loving (yeah yeah) is money in the hand
Your sweet loving is better than a kiss (yeah, yeah)
When you leave me, sweet kisses I miss
(Silvia...)
Yes Mickey?
(How do you call your loverboy?)
Come 'ere loverboy!

I go out walking after midnight
Out in the moonlight just like we used to do
I'm always walking after midnight, searching for you
I walk for miles along the highway
Well, that's just my way of saying, I love you
I'm always walking after midnight, searching for you

I stopped to see a weeping willow
Crying on his pillow
Maybe he's crying for me
And as the skies turn gloomy
Night winds whisper to me
I'm lonesome as I can be

I go out walking after midnight
Out in the starlight
Just hoping you may be somewhere walking
After midnight searching for me

I stopped to see a weeping willow
Crying on his pillow
Maybe he's crying for me
And as the skies turn gloomy
Night winds whisper to me
I'm lonesome as I can be
I'm out walking after midnight, out in the starlight
Just hoping maybe you're somewhere
Walking after midnight, searching for me

***************

Maybe, if I pray every night
You'll come back to me
And maybe, if I cry every day
You'll come back to stay
Oh, maybe
Maybe, if I hold your hand
You will understand
And maybe, if I kissed your lips
I'll be at your command
Oh, maybe
I've cried and prayed to the Lord
To send you back my love
But instead you came to me
But only in my dreams
Maybe if I pray every night
You'll come back to me
And maybe if I cry every day
You'll come back to stay
Oh, maybe
(Maybe, maybe, maybe)
Maybe (Maybe, maybe, maybe)
Maybe (Maybe, maybe, maybe)

I don't have plans and schemes
And I don't have hopes and dreams

Since I don't have you
I don't have fond desires
And I don't have happy hours
I-I-I don't have anything
Since I don't have you
I don't have happiness and I guess
I never will again
When you walked out on me
In walked old misery
And he's been here since then
I don't have love to share
And I don't have one who cares
I-I-I don't have anything
Since I don't have
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
(You )
