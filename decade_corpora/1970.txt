ROCKET MAN

These niggas know the deal, it's easy to get killed
Wet that pussy up, see now you got the chills
Your bright idea shooting at me, the fuck yeah
Bright idea, 'til I blew out his light bulb
I'm more than a hip hop legend, I'm iconic
My sixteen is strong as fuck, I'm bionic
Apparently...you a parody of real nigga shit
Pop your forehead like a zit
I don't fuck with no snitches so I need to know who telling
And I need to know who they told on so I can fact check it
The alpha and omega, Mobb nigga I'm a fixture
Black culture, bougie niggas get they bitch took
Like bad bitches get they body shook
From Jamaica Ave. to the boulevard in Hollywood
From the projects, Nam and Oslo
Rocketman Elton John, call me P-iano

Yeah now I'm on my shit, got me on my shit
I'll hit a nigga with the clipper
And fade a nigga real quick, see
Keep me on my shit, wiling on that shit
I will ruin your life, I promise you that shit

Swedish features through the window of a Lincoln on the Bell swerving
I felt certain I was born to be the best Earthling
Felt worthless, so many Xs and circles
On my mother neck I know I serve a purpose
Smoke the same shit that turns a normal turtle to a ninja turtle
Neo-ninja doing ? on Myrtle
The motherfucker making a drug look like Urkel
Foreign shooters like Türkoğlu
740 with the curtain and set to 1020 degrees
Eyes closed switching speeds, hitting the weave
I shapeshift to a disease, attack your lung and cripple your knees
R&b chicks are twisted with ease, blitzkrieg
You still posing for your little-league pictures
I'm drinking beer straight out the pitcher
I'll put your moms in an armbar at the bar-mitzvah
Irish linen on the king
I'm guaranteed I'm gonna win another ring

I supercede that crap, now bitches want this hard shit
Niggas want this crack, them songs you got that's garbage
Paralyze your ears, stop talking, this P rapping
Been doing this for years, know money I keep racking, up
Come with it nigga, get beat the fuck, up
Next to me you're chuck meat
Yeah, we just committed suicide
With this swammi I get busy B; do or die
Big bar champion, the Henny and the rap flow
The great black shark, you just a little mackeral
My bitch appetite for power surpass yours
Now imagine my thoughts while I'm alone and you paused
That's 600 horses stomping on your neck strap
That's me, g-leaning with the pistol on my lap
Got a 3:00 your death, I could pencil you in
Ya'll niggas is chow, my gun fit to dig in

SIGNED, SEALED, DELIVERED

Ah-hey!
Oh yeah, baby!

Like a fool I went and stayed too long
Now I'm wondering if your love's still strong
Ooh baby, here I am, signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours! Mmh!
Then that time I went and said goodbye
Now I'm back and not ashamed to cry
Ooh baby, here I am, signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours! Ahh!

Here I am, baby, oh oh
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours

You got my future in your hands, hey hey
I've done a lot of foolish things
That I really didn't mean, ah hey, yeah yeah
Didn't I? Oh baby

Seen a lot of things in this old world
When I touch them, they mean nothing, girl
Ooh baby, here I am, signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours!
Ahh, I’m yours!
Ooh wee baby, you set my soul on fire
That's why I know you're my heart's only desire
Ooh baby, here I am, signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours!

Here I am, baby
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours

MAGGIE MAY

Wake up, Maggie
I think I got something to say to you
It's late September and
I really should be back at school

I know I keep you amused
But I feel I'm being used
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried anymore
You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone
You stole my heart and that's what really hurts

The morning sun, when it's in your face
Really shows your age
That don't worry me none
In my eyes, you're everything

I laughed at all of your jokes
My love you didn't need to coax
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried anymore
You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone
You stole my soul and that's a pain I can do without
All I needed was a friend
To lend a guiding hand
But you turned into a lover, and mother what a lover!
You wore me out

All you did was wreck my bed
And in the morning kick me in the head
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried anymore
You led me away from home
'Cause you didn't want to be alone
You stole my heart, I couldn't leave you if I tried


I suppose I could collect my books
And get on back to school
Or steal my daddy's cue
And make a living out of playing pool

Or find myself a rock & roll band
That needs a helping hand
Oh, Maggie, I wished I'd never seen your face
You made a first-class fool out of me
But I'm as blind as a fool can be
You stole my heart, but I love you anyway

Maggie, I wished I'd never seen your face
I'll get on back home one of these days, ooh, ooh, ooh

WONDERFUL TONIGHT

It's late in the evening, she's wondering what clothes to wear
She puts on her make-up and brushes her long blonde hair
And then she asks me, "Do I look all right?"
And I say, "Yes, you look wonderful tonight"

We go to a party and everyone turns to see
This beautiful lady that's walking around with me
And then she asks me "Do you feel all right?"
And I say, "Yes, I feel wonderful tonight"

I feel wonderful because I see
The love light in your eyes
And the wonder of it all
Is that you just don't realize how much I love you

It's time to go home now and I've got an aching head
So I give her the car keys and she helps me to bed
And then I tell her, as I turn out the light
I say, "My darling, you were wonderful tonight
Oh my darling, you were wonderful tonight"

SEPTEMBER

Do you remember the 21st night of September?
Love was changin' the minds of pretenders
While chasin' the clouds away
Our hearts were ringin' in the key that our souls were singin'
As we danced in the night, remember
How the stars stole the night away, oh, yeah

Hey, hey, hey!
Ba-dee-ya, say, do you remember?
Ba-dee-ya, dancin' in September
Ba-dee-ya, never was a cloudy day

Ba-du-da, ba-du-da, ba-du-da, ba-du
Ba-du-da, ba-du, ba-du-da, ba-du
Ba-du-da, ba-du, ba-du-da

My thoughts are with you, holdin' hands with your heart to see you
Only blue talk and love, remember
How we knew love was here to stay
Now December, found the love that we shared in September
Only blue talk and love, remember, the true love we share today
Hey, hey, hey!
Ba-dee-ya, say, do you remember?
Ba-dee-ya, dancin' in September
Ba-dee-ya, never was a cloudy day
There was a…
Ba-dee-ya (Dee-ya, dee-ya), say, do you remember?
Ba-dee-ya (Dee-ya, dee-ya), dancin' in September
Ba-dee-ya (Dee-ya, dee-ya), golden dreams were shiny days

The bell was ringin', oh, oh
Our souls were singin'
Do you remember never a cloudy day? Yow

There was a
Ba-dee-ya (Dee-ya, dee-ya), say, do you remember?
Ba-dee-ya (Dee-ya, dee-ya), dancin' in September

HOTEL CALIFORNIA

On a dark desert highway
Cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas
Rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance
I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night
There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself
"This could be Heaven or this could be Hell"
Then she lit up a candle
And she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say

"Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year (Any time of year)
You can find it here"
Her mind is Tiffany-twisted
She got the Mercedes Bends, uh
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys
That she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard
Sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember
Some dance to forget
So I called up the Captain
"Please bring me my wine"
He said, "We haven't had that spirit here since 1969"
And still those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say

"Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
They living it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise (What a nice surprise)
Bring your alibis"

Mirrors on the ceiling
The pink champagne on ice
And she said: "We are all just prisoners here
Of our own device"
And in the master's chambers
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast
Last thing I remember, I was
Running for the door
I had to find the passage back
To the place I was before
"Relax," said the night man
"We are programmed to receive
You can check out any time you like
But you can never leave!"

HOW DEEP IS YOUR LOVE

I know your eyes in the morning sun
I feel you touch me in the pouring rain
And the moment that you wander far from me
I wanna feel you in my arms again

And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love
Then you softly leave
And it's me you need to show

How deep is your love?
How deep is your love?
How deep is your love?
I really mean to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breakin’ us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me

I believe in you
You know the door to my very soul
You're the light in my deepest, darkest hour
You're my saviour when I fall
And you may not think I care for you
When you know down inside
That I really do
And it's me you need to show

How deep is your love?
How deep is your love
How deep is your love
I really mean to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breakin’ us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me

Da-da-da-da-da
Na-na-na na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na

And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love
Then you softly leave
And it's me you need to show
How deep is your love?
How deep is your love
How deep is your love
I really mean to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breakin’ us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
How deep is your love
How deep is your love
I really mean to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breakin’ us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
How deep is your love
How deep is your love
I really mean to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breakin’ us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me

We got it together, didn't we?
We've definitely got our thing together, don't we baby?

DANCING IN THE MOONLIGHT

We get it almost every night
When that moon get so big and bright
It's a supernatural delight
Everybody's dancing in the moonlight

Everybody here is out of sight
They don't bark and they don't bite
They keep things loose, they keep things light
Everybody's dancing in the moonlight

Dancing in the moonlight
Everybody's feeling warm and bright
It's such a fine and natural sight
Everybody's dancing in the moonlight

We like our fun and we never fight
You can't dance and stay uptight
It's a supernatural delight
Everybody was dancing in the moonlight

Dancing in the moonlight

FOOTSTEPS IN THE DARK, PTS. 1 & 2

Are we really sure
That a love that lasted for so long
Still endures?
Do I, really care?
Hey hey
Let's talk about the distractions going on elsewhere

I, keep hearing footsteps, baby
In the dark, oh, in the dark
Why? I keep hearing footsteps, baby
In the dark
Oh, in the dark, woo

My mind drifts now and then
Looking down dark corridors and wonders what might have been
Something's up ahead
Hey, should I keep this same direction
Or go back instead?

I, I keep hearing footsteps baby
In the dark, oh, in the dark
Why? I keep hearing footsteps, baby
In the dark
Oh, in the dark, hoo
Honey, let's stop walking around
When there's love lost to be found
Oh, and you Know I still care, I still care
What's the sense of going elsewhere?

Who feels, really sure?
Can that feeling guarantee your happiness shall endure?
Do we really care?
Hey hey
Let's look at what's been happening and try to be more aware

I, I keep hearing footsteps, baby
In the dark, ay, in the dark
Why? I keep hearing footsteps, baby
In the dark
Oh, in the dark, hoo

Hey hey, let's stop walking around
Well, when there's love lost, lost to be found
Oh honey, you Know I still care, I still care
What's the sense of going, going elsewhere?
Oh honey, let's stop walking around, and around, and around
When there's no love to be found
Hey baby, you Know I still care, I still care
What's the sense of going, going elsewhere?

RICH GIRL

You're a rich girl, and you've gone too far
'Cause you know it don't matter anyway
You can rely on the old man's money
You can rely on the old man's money
It's a bitch, girl, but it's gone too far
'Cause you know it don't matter anyway
Say money but it won't get you too far
Get you too far

Don't you know? Don't you know?

For the thrill of it all, oh

BRANDY

There's a port on a western bay
And it serves a hundred ships a day
Lonely sailors pass the time away
And talk about their homes

And there's a girl in this harbor town
And she works layin' whiskey down
They say "Brandy, fetch another round"
She serves them whiskey and wine

The sailors say, "Brandy, you're a fine girl
(You're a fine girl)
What a good wife you would be
(Such a fine girl)
Yeah, your eyes could steal a sailor from the sea"

Brandy wears a braided chain
Made of finest silver from the north of Spain
A locket that bears the name
Of a man that Brandy loved

He came on a summer's day
Bringing gifts from far away
But he made it clear he couldn't stay
No harbor was his home
The sailor said, "Brandy, you're a fine girl
(You're a fine girl)
What a good wife you would be
(Such a fine girl)
But my life, my love and my lady is the sea"

Yeah, Brandy used to watch his eyes
When he told his sailor's story
She could feel the ocean fall and rise
She saw its raging glory
But he had always told the truth
Lord, he was an honest man
And Brandy does her best to understand

At night when the bars close down
Brandy walks through a silent town
And loves a man who's not around
She still can hear him say

She hears him say, "Brandy, you're a fine girl
(You're a fine girl)
What a good wife you would be
(Such a fine girl)
But my life, my love and my lady is the sea
It is, yes, it is"
"Brandy, you're a fine girl
(You're a fine girl)
What a good wife you would be
(Such a fine girl)
But my life, my love and my lady is the sea
It is, it is, yes, it is"

DREAMS

Now here you go again, you say you want your freedom
Well, who am I to keep you down?
It's only right that you should play the way you feel it
But listen carefully to the sound of your loneliness

Like a heartbeat drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering what you had
And what you lost
And what you had
And what you lost

Oh, thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Say, women, they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know
You'll know

Now here I go again, I see the crystal visions
I keep my visions to myself
It's only me who wants to wrap around your dreams
And have you any dreams you'd like to sell?
Dreams of loneliness
Like a heartbeat drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering what you had
And what you lost
And what you had
Oh, what you lost

Thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Women, they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know

Oh, thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Say, women, they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know

You'll know
You will know
Oh, you'll know

MORE THAN A WOMAN

Oh, girl I've known you very well
I've seen you growing everyday
I never really looked before
But now you take my breath away
Suddenly you're in my life
Part of everything I do
You got me working day and night
Just trying to keep a hold on you

Here in your arms I found my paradise
My only chance for happiness
And if I lose you now I think I would die
Oh say you'll always be my baby, we can make it shine
We can take forever, just a minute at a time

More than a woman
More than a woman to me
More than a woman
More than a woman to me

There are stories old and true
Of people so in love like you and me
And I can see myself
Let history repeat itself
Reflecting how I feel for you
Thinking about those people then
I know that in a thousand years
I'd fall in love with you again
This is the only way that we should fly
This is the only way to go
And if I lose you I know I would die
Oh say you'll always be my baby, we can make it shine
We can take forever, just a minute at a time

More than a woman
More than a woman to me
More than a woman
More than a woman to me

Hey..

A SONG FOR YOU

I've been so many places in my life and time
I've sung a lot of songs
I've made some bad rhymes
I've acted out my life on stages
With ten thousand people watching

But we're alone now
And I'm singing this song to you

I know your image of me
Is what I hoped to be
I treated you unkindly
But darling, can't you see?
There's no one more important to me
Baby, can't you see through me?

'Cause we're alone now
And I'm singing this song to you

You taught me precious secrets
Of a true love while holding nothing
You came out in front when I was hiding
But now I'm so much better
And if my words don't come together
Listen to the melody
'Cause my love is in there hiding
I love you in a place
Where there's no space or time
I love you for my life
'Cause you' re a friend of mine
And when my life is over
Remember when we were together

We were alone
And I was singing this song to you

I love you in a place
Where there's no space or time
I love you for my life
'Cuz you' re a friend of mine
And when my life is over
Remember when we were together

We were alone
And I was singing this song to you
We were alone
And I was singing this song to you
We were alone
And I was singing this song
Singing this song to you
***************

THE CHAIN

Fuck

Listen to the wind blow
Watch the sun rise
Run in the shadows
Damn your love, damn your lies

And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain (Never break the chain)
And if you don't love me now (You don't love me now)
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying (Still hear you saying)
You would never break the chain (Never break the chain)

Listen to the wind blow
Down comes the night
Run in the shadows
Damn your love, damn your lies
Break the silence
Damn the dark, damn the light
And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain (Never break the chain)
And if you don't love me now (You don't love me now)
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying (Still hear you saying)
You would never break the chain (Never break the chain)
And if you don't love me now (You don't love me now)
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying (Still hear you saying)
You would never break the chain (Never break the chain)

(Chain, keep us together) Run in the shadow
(Chain, keep us together) Runnin' in the shadow
(Chain, keep us together) Runnin' in the shadow
(Chain, keep us together) Run in the shadow
(Chain, keep us together) Run in the shadow

SARA SMILE

Baby hair, with a woman's eyes
I can feel you watching in the night
All alone with me and we're waiting for the sunlight

When I feel cold, you warm me
And when I feel I can't go on
You come and hold me
It's you and me forever

Sara, smile
Oh, won't you smile awhile for me, Sara

If you feel like leaving, you know you can go
But why don't you stay until tomorrow
If you want to be free
You know all you got to do is say so

When you feel cold, I'll warm you
And when you feel you can't go on
I'll come and hold you
It's you and me forever
Sara, smile
Oh, won't you smile awhile for me, Sara
Sara, smile
Oh, won't you smile awhile, Sara

Smile awhile
Oh, won't you smile awhile for me, Sara
Oh, smile awhile
Won't you laugh, Sara
Thank you for making me feel like a man
Not keeping me crazy, crazy
Smile awhile

BENNIE AND THE JETS

Hey kids, shake it loose together
The spotlight's hitting something
That's been known to change the weather
We'll kill the fatted calf tonight so stick around
You're gonna hear electric music, solid walls of sound

Say, Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet?
Ooh, but they're so spaced out
B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets
Oh, but they're weird and they're wonderful
Oh, Bennie, she's really keen

She's got electric boots, a mohair suit
You know I read it in a magazine, oh
B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets

Hey kids, plug into the faithless
Maybe they're blinded, but Bennie makes them ageless
We shall survive, let us take ourselves along
Where we fight our parents out in the streets
To find who's right and who's wrong
Say, Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet?
Ooh, but they're so spaced out
B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets
Oh, but they're weird and they're wonderful
Oh, Bennie, she's really keen

She's got electric boots
A mohair suit
You know I read it in a magazine
B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets

Oh, Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet?
Oh, but they're so spaced out
B-B-B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets
Oh, but they're weird and they're wonderful
Oh, Bennie, she's really keen

She's got electric boots, a mohair suit
You know I read it in a magazine
B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets

Bennie, Bennie and the Jets
Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie and the Jets
Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie and the Jets
Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie and the Jets
Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie and the Jets, the Jets, the Jets

ALL THINGS MUST PASS

Sunrise doesn't last all morning
A cloudburst doesn't last all day
Seems my love is up and has left you with no warning
It's not always going to be this gray

All things must pass
All things must pass away

Sunset doesn't last all evening
A mind can blow those clouds away
After all this, my love is up and must be leaving
It's not always going to be this gray

All things must pass
All things must pass away

All things must pass
None of life's strings can last
So, I must be on my way and face another day

Now the darkness only stays at nighttime
In the morning it will fade away
Daylight is good at arriving at the right time
It's not always going to be this gray
All things must pass
All things must pass away
All things must pass
All things must pass away

LOVELY DAY

When I wake up in the morning, love
And the sunlight hurts my eyes
And something without warning, love
Bears heavy on my mind

Then I look at you
And the world's alright with me
Just one look at you
And I know it's gonna be
A lovely day
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)
A lovely day
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)

When the day that lies ahead of me
Seems impossible to face
When someone else instead of me
Always seems to know the way

Then I look at you
And the world's alright with me
Just one look at you
And I know it's gonna be
A lovely day
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)
A lovely day
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)
When the day that lies ahead of me
Seems impossible to face
When someone else instead of me
Always seems to know the way

Then I look at you
And the world's alright with me
Just one look at you
And I know it's gonna be
A lovely day
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)

YOUR SMILING FACE

Whenever I see your smiling face
I have to smile myself
Because I love you (Yes, I do)
And when you give me that pretty little pout
It turns me inside out
There's something about you, baby (I don't know)

Isn't it amazing a man like me
Can feel this way
Tell me how much longer
It will grow stronger every day
Oh, how much longer

I thought I was in love
A couple of times before
With the girl next door
But that was long before I met you
Now I'm sure that I won't forget you
And I thank my lucky stars
That you are who you are
And not just another lovely lady
Sent down to break my heart
Isn't it amazing a man like me
Can feel this way
Tell me how much longer
It will grow stronger every day
Oh, how much longer

No one can tell me that I'm doing wrong today
Whenever I see you smile at me
No one can tell me that, tell me that I'm doing wrong today
Whenever I see your smiling face my way
No one can tell me that I'm doing wrong today
No one can tell me that I'm doing wrong today, no no darling
No no, darling, no no, yeah yeah
No one can tell me that I'm doing wrong today

JET AIRLINER

Leavin' home, out on the road
I've been down before
Ridin' along on this big ol' jet plane
I've been thinkin' about my home
But my love light teems so far away
And I feel like it's all been done
Somebody's tryin' to make me stay
You know I've got to be movin' on

Oh, oh, big ol' jet airliner
Don't carry me too far away
Oh, oh, big ol' jet airliner
'Cause it's here that I've got to stay

Goodbye to all my friends at home
Goodbye to people I've trusted
I've got to go out and make my way
I might get rich, you know, I might get busted
But my heart keeps calling me backwards
As I get on the 707
Ridin' high, I got tears in my eyes
You know you got to go through hell
Before you get to heaven
Big ol' jet airliner
Don't carry me too far away
Oh, oh, big ol' jet airliner
'Cause it's here that I've got to stay

Touchin' down in New England town
Feel the heat comin' down
I've got to keep on keepin' on
You know the big wheel keeps on spinnin' around
And I'm goin' with some hesitation
You know that I can surely see
That I don't want to get caught up in any of that
Funky shit goin' down in the city

Big ol' jet airliner
Don't carry me too far away
Oh, oh, big ol' jet airliner
'Cause it's here that I've got to stay

Oh, oh, big ol' jet airliner
Don't carry me too far away
Oh, oh, big ol' jet airliner
'Cause it's here that I've got to stay
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Big ol' jet airliner
Don't carry me too far away
Oh, oh, big ol' jet airliner
'Cause it's here that I've got to stay

Oh, oh, big ol' jet airliner
Carry me to my home
Oh, oh, big ol' jet airliner
'Cause it's there that I belong
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Big ol' jet airliner

DANNY'S SONG

People smile and tell me I'm the lucky one
And we've only just begun
Think I'm gonna have a son
He will be like she and me, as free as a dove
Conceived in love
Sun is gonna shine above

And even though we ain't got money
I'm so in love with you, honey
And everything will bring a chain of love
And in the morning, when I rise
You bring a tear of joy to my eyes
And tell me everything is gonna be alright

Seems as though, a month ago, I was Beta-Chi
Never got high
Oh, I was a sorry guy
And now, I smile and face the girl that shares my name
Now I'm through with the game
This boy will never be the same

And even though we ain't got money
I'm so in love with you, honey
And everything will bring a chain of love
And in the morning, when I rise
You bring a tear of joy to my eyes
And tell me everything is gonna be alright
Pisces, Virgo rising is a very good sign
Strong and kind
And the little boy is mine
Now I see a family where there once was none
Now we've just begun
Yeah, we're gonna fly to the sun

And even though we ain't got money
I'm so in love with you, honey
And everything will bring a chain of love
And in the morning, when I rise
You bring a tear of joy to my eyes
And tell me everything is gonna be alright

Love the girl who holds the world in a paper cup
Drink it up
Love her and she'll bring you luck
And if you find she helps your mind, better take her home
Don't you live alone
Try to earn what lovers own

And even though we ain't got money
I'm so in love with you, honey
And everything will bring a chain of love
And in the morning, when I rise
You bring a tear of joy to my eyes
And tell me everything is gonna be alright

LANDSLIDE

I took my love, took it down
I climbed a mountain, and I turned around
And I saw my reflection in the snow-covered hills
Till the landslide brought me down

Oh, mirror in the sky, what is love?
Can the child within my heart rise above?
Can I sail through the changing ocean tides?
Can I handle the seasons of my life?
Hmmmm

Well, I've been afraid of changing
'Cause I've built my life around you
But time makes you bolder, even children get older
And I'm getting older too


Well, I've been afraid of changing
'Cause I've built my life around you
But time makes you bolder, even children get older
And I'm getting older too
Oh, I'm getting older too
I take my love, take it down
Oh, climb a mountain and turn around
And If you see my reflection in the snow-covered hills
Well, the landslide will bring you down

And If you see my reflection in the snow covered hills
Well, the landslide will bring you down
Oh, the landslide will bring it down

REMINISCING

Friday night, it was late
I was walking you home
We got down to the gate
And I was dreaming of the night
Would it turn out right?

How to tell you, girl
I want to build my world around you
Tell you that it's true
I want to make you understand
I'm talking about a lifetime plan

That's the way it began
We were hand-in-hand
Glenn Miller's band
Was better than before
We yelled and screamed for more

And the Porter tune (night and day)
Made us dance across the room
It ended all too soon
On the way back home
I promised you'd never be alone
Hurry, don't be late
I can hardly wait
I said to myself when we're old
We'll go dancing in the dark
Walking through the park
And reminiscing

Friday night, it was late
I was walking you home
We got down to the gate
And I was dreaming of the night
Would it turn out right?

Now as the years roll on
Each time we hear our favourite song
The memories come along
Older times we're missing
Spending the hours reminiscing

Hurry, don't be late
I can hardly wait
I said to myself when we're old
We'll go dancing in the dark
Walking through the park
And reminiscing

RENEGADE

Oh Mama, I'm in fear for my life from the long arm of the law
Lawman has put an end to my running, and I'm so far from my home
Oh Mama, I can hear you a-cryin', you're so scared and all alone
Hangman is comin' down from the gallows, and I don't have very long
(Yeah!)

The jig is up, the news is out
They finally found me
The renegade who had it made
Retrieved for a bounty
Nevermore to go astray
This'll be the end today
Of the wanted man

Oh Mama, I've been years on the lam and had a high price on my head
Lawman said, "Get him dead or alive;" I was for sure he'll see me dead
Dear Mama, I can hear you a-cryin', you're so scared and all alone
Hangman is comin' down from the gallows, and I don't have very long

GOT TO GIVE IT UP

I used to go out to parties
And stand around
Cause I was too nervous
To really get down
But my body yearned to be free
I got up on the floor and thought
Somebody could choose me
No more standin' there beside the walls
I done got myself together baby
And now I'm havin' a ball
As long as you're groovin'
There's always a chance
Somebody watches
Might wanna make romance
Move your body, ooo baby, you dance all night
To the groove and feel alright
Everybody's groovin' on like a fool
But if you see me spread out and let me in
Baby just party high and low
Let me step into your erotic zone
Move it up
Turn it 'round
Shake it down
OOWWWW
You can love me when you want to babe
This is such a groovy party baby
We're here face to face
Everybody's swingin'
This is such a groovy place
All the young ladies are so fine!
You're movin your body easy with no doubts
I know what you thinkin' baby
You wanna turn me out
Think I'm gonna let you do it babe
Keep on dancin'
You got to get it
Got to give it up
Keep on dancin' (You got to get it)
Got to give it up
Keep on dancin' (You got to get it)
Got to give it up
Keep on dancin' (You got to get it)
Got to give it up
Keep on dancin' (You got to get it)
Got to give it up
Keep on dancin' (You got to get it, oh darling)
Got to give it up

RHIANNON

Rhiannon rings like a bell through the night
And wouldn't you love to love her?
Takes to the sky like a bird in flight
And who will be her lover?

All your life you've never seen a woman
Taken by the wind
Would you stay if she promised you heaven?
Will you ever win?

She is like a cat in the dark
And then she is the darkness
She rules her life like a fine skylark
And when the sky is starless
Once in a million years a lady like her rises
Oh no, Rhiannon, you cry, but she's gone
Your life knows no answer, your life knows no answer

All your life you've never seen a woman
Taken by the wind
Would you stay if she promised you heaven?
Will you ever win?
Will you ever win?

TINY DANCER

Blue jean baby, L.A. lady
Seamstress for the band
Pretty-eyed, pirate smile
You'll marry a music man
Ballerina, you must've seen her
Dancing in the sand
And now she's in me, always with me
Tiny dancer in my hand

Jesus freaks out in the street
Handing tickets out for God
Turning back, she just laughs
The boulevard is not that bad
Piano man, he makes his stand
In the auditorium
Looking on, she sings the songs
The words she knows, the tune she hums

But, oh, how it feels so real
Lying here with no one near
Only you, and you can hear me
When I say softly, slowly
Hold me closer, tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today
Hold me closer, tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today

I'm a lover, and I'm a sinner
I play my music in the sun
I'm a joker, I'm a smoker
I'm a midnight toker
I get my lovin' on the run
I'm a picker, I'm a grinner
I'm a lover, and I'm a sinner
I play my music in the sun
I'm a joker, I'm a smoker
I'm a midnight toker
I sure don't want to hurt no one
Whoo
Whoo

People keep talking about me, baby
Say I'm doing you wrong
Well, don't you worry, don't worry, no, don't worry, mama
'Cause I'm right here at home
You're the cutest thing I ever did see
Really love your peaches, wanna shake your tree
Lovey-dovey, lovey-dovey, lovey-dovey all the time
C'mon baby, now I'll show you a good time

HOPELESSLY DEVOTED TO YOU

Guess mine is not the first heart broken
My eyes are not the first to cry
I'm not the first to know
There's just no getting over you
You know, I'm just a fool who's willing
To sit around and wait for you
But baby, can't you see
There's nothing else for me to do?
I'm hopelessly devoted to you

But now there's nowhere to hide
Since you pushed my love aside
I'm out of my head
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you

My head is saying, "Fool, forget him"
My heart is saying, "Don't let go
Hold on till the end"
And that's what I intend to do
I'm hopelessly devoted to you
But now there's nowhere to hide
Since you pushed my love aside
I'm out of my head
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you

I GOT LUCKY

Never found a four leaf clover
To bring good luck to me
No rabbit's foot, no lucky star
No magic wishing tree
But I got lucky, yes, I got lucky
(I got lucky, lucky when)
When I found you, oh oh, yeah

Got no rainbow around my shoulder
No horseshoe on my door
But I got you to hold me tight
And who could ask for more

Oh, I got lucky, yes, I got lucky
(I got lucky, lucky when)
When I found you
(When I found you)

I always walk around
With all my fingers crossed
I'm afraid the love I found
Just might get lost
So won't you tell me that you love me
Hurry up and name the day
And then I'll know that my good luck
Is really here to stay


I always walk around
With all my fingers crossed
I'm afraid the love I found
Just might get lost

So won't you tell me that you love me
Hurry up and name the day
And then I'll know that my good luck
Is really here to stay


Oh, I got lucky, yes, I got lucky
(I got lucky)

BABY COME BACK

Spending all my nights, all my money going out on the town
Doing anything just to get you off of my mind
But when the morning comes, I'm right back where I started again
And tryin' to forget you is just a waste of time

Baby come back, any kind of fool could see
There was something in everything about you
Baby come back, you can blame it all on me
I was wrong and I just can't live without you

All day long, I'm wearing a mask of false bravado
Trying to keep up a smile that hides a tear
But as the sun goes down, I get that empty feeling again
How I wish to God that you were here

Baby come back, oh baby, any kind of fool could see
There was something in everything about you
Baby come back, you can blame it all on me
I was wrong and I just can't live without you, oh

Now that I put it all together, oh oh
Give me the chance to make you see
Have you used up all the love in your heart?
Nothing left for me? Ain't there nothing left for me?
Baby come back, oh darling, any kind of fool could see
There was something in everything about you
Baby come back, listen baby, you can blame it all on me
I was wrong and I just can't live without you
I was wrong and I just can't live

TAKE ME HOME, COUNTRY ROADS

Almost Heaven, West Virginia
Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River
Life is old there, older than the trees
Younger than the mountains, growing like a breeze

Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong

Dark and dusty, painted on the sky
Misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye

Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mama
Take me home, country roads

I hear her voice in the morning hour, she calls me
The radio reminds me of my home far away

WAITING IN VAIN

I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love

From the very first time I blessed my eyes on you, girl
My heart says follow through
But I know, now, that I'm way down on your line
But the waitin' feel is fine
So don't treat me like a puppet on a string
Cause I know how to do my thing
Don't talk to me as if you think I'm dumb
I wanna know when you're gonna come, see

I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love

Cause if summer is here
I'm still waiting there
Winter is here

It's been three years since I'm knockin' on your door
And I still can knock some more
Cuckoo girl, cuckoo girl, is it feasible?
I wanna know now, for I to knock some more
Ya see, in life I know there's lots of grief
But your love is my relief
Tears in my eyes burn - tears in my eyes burn
While I'm waiting - while I'm waiting for my turn

OH! SWEET NUTHIN'

Say a word for Jimmy Brown
He ain't got nothing at all
He knocked the shirt right off his back
He ain't got nothing at all
And say a word for Ginger Brown
He walks with his head down to the ground
Took the shoes right off his feet
And threw the poor boy right out in the street
And this is what he said

Oh sweet nuthin'
She ain't got nuthin' at all
Oh sweet nuthin'
She ain't got nuthin' at all

Say a word for Pearly May
She can't tell the night from the day
They threw her out in the street
Just like a cat she landed on her feet
And say a word for Joana Love
She ain't got nothing at all
With every day she falls in love
And every night she falls
And when she does she says
Oh sweet nuthin'
You know she ain't got nuthin' at all
Whoa oh, sweet nuthin'
She ain't got nuthin' at all
Oh let me hear you


Oh, say a word, say a word for Jimmy Brown
He ain't got nothing at all, not a thing
And not a shirt, shirt on his back
No, he ain't got nothing at all
And say a word for Ginger
He walks with his head to the ground
He took the shoes, took the shoes from his feet, from his feet
And threw the poor boy out into the street
And then he said

Oh sweet sweet nuthin'
She ain't got, she ain't got, she ain't got nuthin' at all
Sweet sweet, sweet sweet nuthin'

DIRTY WORK

Times are hard
You're afraid to pay the fee
So you find yourself somebody
Who can do the job for free
When you need a bit of lovin'
'Cause your man is out of town
That's the time you get me runnin'
And you know I'll be around

I'm a fool to do your dirty work, oh yeah
I don't wanna do your dirty work no more
I'm a fool to do your dirty work, oh yeah

Light the candle
Put the lock upon the door
You have sent the maid home early
Like a thousand times before
Like the castle in its corner
In a medieval game
I foresee terrible trouble
And I stay here just the same

I'm a fool to do your dirty work, oh yeah
I don't wanna do your dirty work no more
I'm a fool to do your dirty work, oh yeah


I'm a fool to do your dirty work, oh yeah

IT'S A SHAME

It's a shame, the way you mess around with your man
It's a shame the way you hurt me
It's a shame, the way you mess around with your man
I'm sitting all alone, by the telephone
Waiting for your call, when you don't call at all
It's a shame (shame) the way you mess around with your man
It's a shame (shame) the way you play with my emotions
It's a shame (shame) the way you mess around with your man
You're like a child at play, on a sunny day
'Cause you play with love, and then you throw it away
Why do you use me, try to confuse me
How can you stand, to be so cruel
Why don't you free me, from this prison
Where I serve my time as your fool
It's a shame (shame) the way you mess around with your man
It's a shame (shame) the way you hurt me
It's a shame (shame) the way you mess around with your man
I try to stay with you, show you love so true
But you won't appreciate, the love we try to make
Oh, it's got to be a shame
Why do you use me, try to confuse me
How can you stand, to be so cruel
Why don't you free me, from this prison
Where I serve my time as your fool
Got to be a shame (shame) the way you mess around with your man
Ohhh, it's a shame (shame) the way you hurt me
It's a shame (shame) the way you mess around with your man
You've got my heart in chains, and I must complain
I just can't be confined, oh, looking back in time
Got to, got to, be a shame

COME SAIL AWAY

I'm sailing away
Set an open course for the Virgin Sea
'Cause I've got to be free
Free to face the life that's ahead of me
On board I'm the captain, so climb aboard
We'll search for tomorrow on every shore
And I'll try, oh Lord, I'll try to carry on

I look to the sea
Reflections in the waves spark my memory
Some happy, some sad
I think of childhood friends, and the dreams we had
We lived happily forever, so the story goes
But somehow we missed out on the pot of gold
But we'll try best that we can, to carry on

A gathering of angels appeared above my head
They sang to me this song of hope, and this is what they said

They said: Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me, lads
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me, babe
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me

I thought that they were angels, but to my surprise
We climbed aboard their starship, we headed for the skies

Singing come sail away, come sail away, come sail with me, lads
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me

JUST MY IMAGINATION

Each day through my window I watch her as she passes by
I say to myself, "You're such a lucky guy
To have a girl like her is truly a dream come true
Out of all the fellows in the world, she belongs to you"

But it was just my imagination, runnin' away with me
It was just my imagination runnin' away with me

Soon we'll be married and raise a family (Oh yeah)
A cozy little home out in the country
With two children, maybe three
I tell you I can visualize it all
This couldn't be a dream for too real it all seems

But it was just my imagination once again runnin' away with me
Tell you it was just my imagination runnin' away with me

Ev'ry night on my knees I pray, Dear Lord, hear my plea
Don't ever let another take her love from me or I would surely die
Her love is heavenly, when her arms enfold me
I hear a tender rhapsody; but in reality she doesn't even know me
Just my imagination once again runnin' away with me
Tell you it was just my imagination runnin' away with me
I’ve never met her but I can't forget her
Just my imagination once again runnin' away with me
Just my imagination runnin' away with me

MOVE ON UP

Hush now, child
And don't you cry
Your folks might understand you
By and by
Just move on up
Toward your destination
Though you may find, from time to time, complication
Bite your lip

Though there may be wet road ahead
And you cannot slip
Just move on up
For peace you'll find
Into the steeple of beautiful people
Where there's only one kind
So hush now, child
And don't you cry
Your folks might understand you
By and by
Move on up
And keep on wishin'
Remember your dream is your only scheme
So keep on pushin'
Take nothing less
Than the supreme best
Do not obey rumors people say
'Cause you can pass the test
Just move on up
To a greater day
With just a little faith
If you put your mind to it, you can surely do it
Just move on up
Move on up
But move on up
Oh, child, but just a-move on up
But move on up

ISN'T SHE LOVELY

Isn't she lovely?
Isn't she wonderful?
Isn't she precious?
Less than one minute old
I never thought through love we'd be
Making one as lovely as she
But isn't she lovely made from love?

Isn't she pretty?
Truly the angel's best
Boy, I'm so happy
We have been heaven blessed
I can't believe what God has done
Through us he's given life to one
But isn't she lovely made from love?


Isn't she lovely?
Life and love are the same
Life is Aisha
The meaning of her name
Londie, it could have not been done
Without you who conceived the one
That's so very lovely made from love

YOU MAKE ME FEEL LIKE DANCING

You've got a cute way of talking
You got the better of me
Just snap your fingers
And I'm walking
Like a dog hanging on your lead
I'm in a spin
You know
Shaking on a string
You know

You make me feel like dancing
I'm gonna dance the night away
You make me feel like dancing
I'm gonna dance the night away
You make feel like dancing
I feel like dancing
Dancing
Dance the night away
I feel like dancing
Dancing
Ah
Quarter to four in the morning
I ain't feeling tired
No, no, no, no, no
Just hold me tight
And leave on the light
'Cause I don't want to go home
You put a spell on me
I'm right where you want me to be

You make me feel like dancing
I'm gonna dance the night away
You make me feel like dancing
I'm gonna dance the night away
You make feel like dancing
I feel like dancing
Dancing
Dance the night away
I feel like dancing
Dancing
Dance the night away
Ah
And if you'll let me stay
We'll dance our lives away

You make me feel like dancing
I wanna dance my life away
You make me feel like dancing
I wanna dance my life away
You make me feel like dancing
I wanna dance my life away
(I feel like dancing)
You make me feel like dancing
I wanna dance my life away

PEG

I've seen your picture
Your name in lights above it
This is your big debut
It's like a dream come true
So won't you smile for the camera
I know they're gonna love it
Peg

I like your pin shot
I keep it with your letter
Done up in blueprint blue
It sure looks good on you
And when you smile for the camera
I know I'll love you better

Peg, it will come back to you
Peg, it will come back to you
Then the shutter falls
You see it all in 3-D
It's your favorite foreign movie

THREE LITTLE BIRDS

"Don't worry about a thing
'Cause every little thing is gonna be alright"
Singing, "Don't worry about a thing
'Cause every little thing is gonna be alright!"

Rise up this morning, smiled with the rising sun
Three little birds pitch by my doorstep
Singing sweet songs of melodies pure and true
Saying, "This is my message to you"

Singing, "Don't worry about a thing
'Cause every little thing is gonna be alright"
Singing, "Don't worry about a thing (Don't worry)
'Cause every little thing is gonna be alright!"

LIFE IN THE FAST LANE

He was a hard-headed man
He was brutally handsome, and she was terminally pretty
She held him up, and he held her for ransom in the heart
Of the cold, cold city
He had a nasty reputation as a cruel dude
They said he was ruthless, they said he was crude
They had one thing in common, they were good in bed
She'd say, "Faster, faster. The lights are turnin' red."

Life in the fast lane, Surely makes you lose your mind
Life in the fast lane, Huh
Are you with me so far?

Eager for action and hot for the game
The coming attraction, the drop of a name
They knew all the right people, they took all the right pills
They threw outrageous parties, they paid heavenly bills
There were lines on the mirror, lines on her face
She pretended not to notice, she was caught up in the race
Out every evening, until it was light
He was too tired to make it, she was too tired to fight about it

Life in the fast lane, Surely makes you lose your mind
Life in the fast lane, Huh
Life in the fast lane, Everything all the time
Life in the fast lane, Huh
Blowin' and burnin', blinded by thirst
They didn't see the stop sign, took a turn for the worst
She said, "Listen, baby, you can hear the engine ring."
"We've been up and down this highway, haven't seen a goddamn thing."
He said, "Call the doctor. I think I'm gonna crash."
"The doctor says he's comin', but you gotta pay in cash."
They went rushin' down that freeway, messed around and got lost
They didn't care, they were just dyin' to get off

And it was life in the fast lane, Surely makes you lose your mind
Life in the fast lane, Huh
Life in the fast lane, Everything all the time
Life in the fast lane, Huh

Life in the fast lane

ESCAPE

I was tired of my lady
We'd been together too long
Like a worn out recording
Of a favorite song
So while she lay there sleeping
I read the paper in bed
And in the personal columns
There was this letter I read:

"If you like piña coladas
And getting caught in the rain
If you're not into yoga
If you have half a brain
If you like making love at midnight
In the dunes on the cape
Then I'm the love that you've looked for
Write to me and escape"

I didn't think about my lady
I know that sounds kind of mean
But me and my old lady
Had fallen into the same old dull routine
So I wrote to the paper
Took out a personal ad
And though I'm nobody's poet
I thought it wasn't half bad:
"Yes, I like piña coladas
And getting caught in the rain
I'm not much into health food
I am into champagne
I've got to meet you by tomorrow noon
And cut through all this red tape
At a bar called O'Malley's
Where we'll plan our escape"

So I waited with high hopes
And she walked in the place
I knew her smile in an instant
I knew the curve of her face
It was my own lovely lady
And she said, "Aw, it's you"
Then we laughed for a moment
And I said, "I never knew"

That you like piña coladas
And gettin' caught in the rain
And the feel of the ocean
And the taste of champagne
If you like making love at midnight
In the dunes on the cape
You're the lady I've looked for
Come with me and escape
If you like piña coladas
And getting caught in the rain
If you're not into yoga
If you have half a brain
If you like making love at midnight
In the dunes on the cape
Then I'm the love that you've looked for
Write to me and escape

Yes I like piña coladas
And getting caught in the rain
I'm not much into health food
I am into champagne
I've got to meet you by tomorrow noon
And cut through all this red tape
At a bar called O'Malley's
Where we'll plan our escape

MY LIFE

Got a call from an old friend, we used to be real close
Said he couldn't go on the American way
Closed the shop, sold the house, bought a ticket to the west coast
Now he gives them a stand-up routine in L.A

I don't need you to worry for me 'cause I'm alright
I don't want you to tell me it's time to come home
I don't care what you say anymore, this is my life
Go ahead with your own life, leave me alone

I never said you had to offer me a second chance
(I never said you had to...)
I never said I was a victim of circumstance
(I never said...)

I still belong (Still belong)
Don't get me wrong (Get me wrong)
And you can speak your mind
But not on my time
They will tell you you can't sleep alone in a strange place
Then they'll tell you you can't sleep with somebody else
Ah, but sooner or later, you sleep in your own space
Either way, it's okay, you wake up with yourself

I don't need you to worry for me 'cause I'm alright
I don't want you to tell me it's time to come home
I don't care what you say anymore, this is my life
Go ahead with your own life, leave me alone

I never said you had to offer me a second chance
(I never said you had to...)
I never said I was a victim of circumstance
(Of circumstance...)

I still belong (Still belong)
Don't get me wrong (Get me wrong)
And you can speak your mind
But not on my time

I don't care what you say anymore, this is my life
Go ahead with your own life, leave me alone
Keep it to yourself, it's my life
Keep it to yourself, it's my life
Keep it to yourself, it's my life
Keep it to yourself, it's my life...

EASY

I know it sounds funny, but I just can't stand the pain
Girl, I'm leaving you tomorrow
Seems to me girl, you know I've done all I can
You see, I begged, stole and I borrowed, yeah, ooh

That's why I'm easy
I'm easy like Sunday morning
That's why I'm easy
I'm easy like Sunday morning

Why in the world would anybody put chains on me, yeah?
I've paid my dues to make it
Everybody wants me to be what they want me to be
I'm not happy when I try to fake it, no, ooh

That's why I'm easy, yeah

That's why I'm easy
I'm easy like Sunday morning

I wanna be high, so high
I wanna be free to know the things I do are right
I wanna be free
Just me, oh babe
Ooh

I'm easy like Sunday morning, yeah

THIS WILL BE

This will be an everlasting love
This will be the one I've waited for
This will be the first time anyone has loved me
I'm so glad you found me in time
And I'm so glad that you rectified my mind
This will be an everlasting love for me
Loving you is some kind of wonderful
Because you showed me just how much you care
You've given me the thrill of a lifetime
And made me believe you've got more thrills to spare, oh
This will be an everlasting love
Oh, yes it will now
You brought a lot of a sunshine into my life
You filled me with happiness I never knew
You gave me more joy than I ever dreamed of
And no one, no one can take the place of you
This will be
You and me
Yes sir-ee
Eternally
Hugging and squeezing and kissing and pleasing together forever through ever whatever
Yeah yeah yeah yeah you and me
So long as I'm living true love I'll be giving to you I'll be serving 'cause you're so deserving
Hey, you're so deserving, you're so deserving

I WANT YOU BACK

Uh-huh huh huh huh
Let me tell ya now
Uh-huh

When I had you to myself, I didn't want you around
Those pretty faces always made you stand out in a crowd
But someone picked you from the bunch, one glance was all it took
Now it's much too late for me to take a second look

Oh, baby, give me one more chance (To show you that I love you)
Won't you please let me (Back in your heart)
Oh, darlin', I was blind to let you go (Let you go, baby)
But now since I see you in his arms (I want you back)

Yes, I do now (I want you back)
Ooh, ooh, baby (I want you back)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (I want you back)
Na, na, na, na

Tryin' to live without your love is one long sleepless night
Let me show you, girl, that I know wrong from right
Every street you walk on I leave tear stains on the ground
Following the girl, I didn't even want around
Let me tell you now
Oh, baby, all I need is one more chance (To show you that I love you)
Won't you please let me (Back in your heart)
Oh, darlin', I was blind to let you go (Let you go, baby)
But now since I see you in his arms, uh-huh

A buh buh buh buh
A buh buh buh buh, all I want
A buh buh buh buh, all I need
A buh buh buh buh, all I want
A buh buh buh buh, all I need

Oh, just one more chance
To show you that I love you
Baby! Baby!
Baby! Baby!
Baby! Baby!
I want you back

Forget what happened then
I want you back

Let me live again
Oh baby, I was blind to let you go
But now since I see you in his arms
I want you back

Spare me of this cause

Gimme back what I lost

Oh baby I need one more chance ha
I tell ya that I love you
Oh! Oh! Oh! I want you back!

GOODBYE YELLOW BRICK ROAD

When are you gonna come down?
When are you going to land?
I should have stayed on the farm
I should have listened to my old man
You know you can't hold me forever
I didn't sign up with you
I'm not a present for your friends to open
This boy's too young to be singing the blues

Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah

So goodbye yellow brick road
Where the dogs of society howl
You can't plant me in your penthouse
I'm going back to my plough
Back to the howling old owl in the woods
Hunting the horny-back toad
Oh, I've finally decided my future lies
Beyond the yellow brick road

Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah
What do you think you'll do, then?
I bet they'll shoot down the plane
It'll take you a couple of vodka and tonics
To set you on your feet again
Maybe you'll get a replacement
There's plenty like me to be found
Mongrels who ain't got a penny
Sniffing for tidbits like you on the ground

Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah

So goodbye yellow brick road
Where the dogs of society howl
You can't plant me in your penthouse
I'm going back to my plough
Back to the howling old owl in the woods
Hunting the horny-back toad
Oh, I've finally decided my future lies
Beyond the yellow brick road

It is the springtime of my loving
The second season I am to know
You are the sunlight in my growing
So little warmth I've felt before
It isn't hard to feel me glowing
I watched the fire that grew so low, oooh, oh


It is the summer of my smiles
Flee from me, keepers of the gloom
Speak to me only with your eyes
It is to you I give this tune
Ain't so hard to recognize, oh
These things are clear to all from time to time, ooh
Oh, oh

Ah, talk, talk, talk, talk
Hey!
I've felt the coldness of my winter
I never thought it would ever go
I cursed the gloom that set upon us, upon us, upon us
But I know that I love you so, ohhhh, oh
But I know that I love you so
These are the seasons of emotion
And like the winds they rise and fall
This is the wonder of devotion
I see the torch we all must hold
This is the mystery of the quotient quotient
Ah, upon us all, upon us all a little rain must fall
Just a little rain, oh yeah
Uhh, ooooh, yeah yeah yeah

HEART OF GLASS

Once I had a love and it was a gas
Soon turned out had a heart of glass
Seemed like the real thing, only to find
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind

Once I had a love and it was divine
Soon found out I was losing my mind
It seemed like the real thing but I was so blind
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind

In between, what I find is pleasing and I'm feeling fine
Love is so confusing, there's no peace of mind
If I fear I'm losing you, it's just no good
You teasing like you do


Once I had a love and it was a gas
Soon turned out had a heart of glass
Seemed like the real thing, only to find
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind
Lost inside, adorable illusion and I cannot hide
I'm the one you're using, please don't push me aside
We could've made it cruising, yeah

(Da-da-da, da-dum-da-dum-da, da-dum-da-da-da
Da-dum-da-dum-da, da-dum-da-da-da, da-dum-da-dum-da)
Yeah, riding high on love's true bluish light
Oooh-ah-ah, oooh-ah-ah, oooh-ah-ah, oooh-ah-ah

Once I had a love and it was a gas
Soon turned out, it was a pain in the ass
Seemed like the real thing only to find
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind

DANCING QUEEN

You can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life
Ooh, see that girl, watch that scene
Digging the dancing queen

Friday night and the lights are low
Looking out for a place to go
Where they play the right music, getting in the swing
You come to look for a king
Anybody could be that guy
Night is young and the music's high
With a bit of rock music, everything is fine
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance

You are the dancing queen
Young and sweet, only seventeen
Dancing queen
Feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah
You can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life
Ooh, see that girl, watch that scene
Digging the dancing queen
You're a teaser, you turn 'em on
Leave 'em burning and then you're gone
Looking out for another, anyone will do
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance

You are the dancing queen
Young and sweet, only seventeen

Feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah
You can dance, you can jive

CARRY ON WAYWARD SON

Carry on, my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more

Once I rose above the noise and confusion
Just to get a glimpse beyond this illusion
I was soaring ever higher
But I flew too high
Though my eyes could see, I still was a blind man
Though my mind could think, I still was a mad man
I hear the voices when I'm dreaming
I can hear them say

Carry on, my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more

Masquerading as a man with a reason
My charade is the event of the season
And if I claim to be a wise man, well
It surely means that I don't know
On a stormy sea of moving emotion
Tossed about I'm like a ship on the ocean
I set a course for winds of fortune
But I hear the voices say
Carry on, my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more, no


Carry on, you will always remember
Carry on, nothing equals the splendor
Now your life's no longer empty
But surely heaven waits for you

Carry on, my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry, don't you cry no more

No more

CAN'T YOU SEE

Gonna take a freight train
Down at the station, Lord
I don't care where it goes
Gonna climb a mountain
The highest mountain
Jump off, nobody gonna know

Can't you see, whoa, can't you see
What that woman, Lord, she been doin' to me
Can't you see, can't you see
What that woman, she been doin' to me

I'm gonna find me
A hole in the wall
I'm gonna crawl inside and die
'Cause my lady, now
A mean ol' woman, Lord
Never told me goodbye

Can't you see, whoa, can't you see
What that woman, Lord, she been doin' to me
Can't you see, can't you see

Ain't a-never comin' back

GIMME! GIMME! GIMME!

Half-past twelve
And I'm watching the late show in my flat, all alone
How I hate to spend the evening on my own
Autumn winds
Blowing outside the window as I look around the room
And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom

There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day

Movie stars
Find the end of the rainbow with a fortune to win
It's so different from the world I'm living in
Tired of TV
I open the window and I gaze into the night
But there's nothing there to see, no one in sight
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day

Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight


There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day

OLD TIME ROCK & ROLL

Just take those old records off the shelf
I'll sit and listen to 'em by myself
Today's music ain't got the same soul
I like that old time rock 'n' roll
Don't try to take me to a disco
You'll never even get me out on the floor
In ten minutes I'll be late for the door
I like that old time rock 'n' roll

Still like that old time rock 'n' roll
That kind of music just soothes my soul
I reminisce about the days of old
With that old time rock 'n' roll


Won't go to hear 'em play a tango
I'd rather hear some blues or funky old soul
There's only one sure way to get me to go
Start playing old time rock 'n' roll
Call me a relic, call me what you will
Say I'm old-fashioned, say I'm over the hill
Today's music ain't got the same soul
I like that old time rock 'n' roll
Still like that old time rock 'n' roll
That kind of music just soothes my soul
I reminisce about the days of old
With that old time rock 'n' roll
Ow!


Still like that old time rock 'n' roll
That kind of music just soothes my soul
I reminisce about the days of old
With that old time rock 'n' roll
Still like that old time rock 'n' roll
That kind of music just soothes my soul
I reminisce about the days of old
With that old time rock 'n' roll
Still like that old time rock 'n' roll
That kind of music just soothes my soul

REELIN' IN THE YEARS

Your everlasting summer
And you can see it fading fast
So you grab a piece of something
That you think is gonna last
Well, you wouldn't even know a diamond
If you held it in your hand
The things you think are precious
I can't understand

Are you reelin' in the years?
Stowin' away the time?
Are you gatherin' up the tears?
Have you had enough of mine?
Are you reelin' in the years?
Stowin' away the time?
Are you gatherin' up the tears?
Have you had enough of mine?

You been tellin' me you're a genius
Since you were seventeen
In all the time I've known you
I still don't know what you mean
The weekend at the college
Didn't turn out like you planned
The things that pass for knowledge
I can't understand
Are you reelin' in the years?
Stowin' away the time?
Are you gatherin' up the tears?
Have you had enough of mine?
Are you reelin' in the years?
Stowin' away the time?
Are you gatherin' up the tears?
Have you had enough of mine?


I spend a lot of money
And I spent a lot of time
The trip we made to Hollywood
Is etched upon my mind
After all the things we've done and seen
You find another man
The things you think are useless
I can't understand

Are you reelin' in the years?
Stowin' away the time?
Are you gatherin' up the tears?
Have you had enough of mine?
Are you reelin' in the years?
Stowin' away the time?
Are you gatherin' up the tears?
Have you had enough of mine?

LOVE REALLY HURTS WITHOUT YOU

You run around town like a fool and you think that it's groovy
You're giving it to some other guy
Who gives you the eye
You don't give nothing to me
You painted a smile and you dress all the while to excite me
But don't you know you're turning me on?
I know that it's wrong
But I can't stop the pain inside me

Baby, love really hurts without you
Love really hurts without you
And it's breaking my heart, but what can I do?
Baby, love really hurts without you
Love really hurts through and through
And it's breaking my heart, but what can I do without you?

You walk like a dream and you make like you're queen of the action
You're using every trick in the book
The way that you look
You're really something to see
You cheat and you lie to impress any guy that you fancy
(Love really hurts without you)
But don't you know I'm out of my mind
So give me a sign
And help to ease the pain inside me
Baby, love really hurts without you
Love really hurts without you
And it's breaking my heart, but what can I do?
Baby, love really hurts without you
Love really hurts through and through
And it's breaking my heart, but what can I do without you?
Oh baby, love really hurts without you
Love really hurts without you
And it's breaking my heart, but what can I do?
Baby, love really hurts without you
Love really hurts through and through
And it's breaking my heart, but what can I do without you?
Baby, love really hurts without you
Love really hurts without you
And it's breaking my heart, but what can I do?

SIR DUKE

Music is a world within itself
With a language we all understand
With an equal opportunity
For all to sing, dance and clap their hands
But just because a record has a groove
Don't make it in the groove
But you can tell right away at letter A
When the people start to move

They can feel it all over
They can feel it all over people
They can feel it all over
They can feel it all over people

Music knows it is and always will
Be one of the things that life just won't quit
But here are some of music's pioneers
That time will not allow us to forget
For there's Basie, Miller, Satchmo
And the king of all Sir Duke
And with a voice like Ella's ringing out
There's no way the band can lose
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people


You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
I can feel it all, all, all-all-all over people

Can't you feel it all over?
Come on, let's feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
Everybody, all over people

SUMMER BREEZE

See the curtains hangin' in the window
In the evening on a Friday night
A little light a-shinin' through the window
Lets me know everything's all right

Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind
Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowin' though the jasmine in my mind

See the paper layin' on the sidewalk
A little music from the house next door
So I walk on up to the doorstep
Through the screen and across the floor

Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind
Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind

Sweet days of summer, the jasmine's in bloom
July is dressed up and playing her tune
And I come home from a hard day's work
And you're waiting there
Not a care in the world
See the smile awaitin' in the kitchen
Through cookin' and the plates for two
Feel the arms that reach out to hold me
In the evening when the day is through

Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind
Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind

I WANNA BE YOUR LOVER

I ain't got no money
I ain't like those other guys you hang around
And it's kinda funny
But they always seem to let you down
And I get discouraged
'Cause I never see you anymore
And I need your love, babe, yeah
That's all I'm living for, yeah

I didn't wanna pressure you, baby
But all I ever wanted to do

I wanna be your lover
I wanna be the only one that makes you come running
I wanna be your lover
I wanna turn you on, turn you out, all night long, make you shout
Oh, lover! yeah
I wanna be the only one you come for

I wanna be your brother
I wanna be your mother and your sister, too
There ain't no other
That can do the things that I'll do to you
And I get discouraged
'Cause you treat me just like a child
And they say I'm so shy, yeah
But with you I just go wild, woo!
I didn't wanna pressure you, baby, no
But all I ever wanted to do
I wanna be your lover
I wanna be the only one that makes you come running
I wanna be your lover
I wanna turn you on, turn you out, all night long, make you shout
Oh, lover! yeah

FIRE ON THE MOUNTAIN

Took my family away from my Carolina home
Had dreams about the West and started to roam
Six long months on a dust covered trail
They say heaven's at the end but so far it's been hell

And there's fire on the mountain, lightning in the air
Gold in them hills and it's waiting for me there

We were digging and sifting from five to five
Selling everything we found just to stay alive
Gold flowed free like the whiskey in the bars
Sinning was the big thing, lord and Satan was his star

And there's fire on the mountain
Lightning in the air
Gold in them hills and it's waiting for me there

Dance hall girls were the evening treat
Empty cartridges and blood lined the gutters of the street
Men were shot down for the sake of fun
Or just to hear the noise of their forty-four guns
And there's fire on the mountain
Lightning in the air
Gold in them hills and it's waiting for me there

Now my widow she weeps by my grave
Tears flow free for her man she couldn't save
Shot down in cold blood by a gun that carried fame
All for a useless and no good worthless claim

And there's fire on the mountain
Lightning in the air
Gold in them hills and it's waiting for me there
And there's fire on the mountain
Lightning in the air
Gold in them hills and it's waiting for me there
***************

NEVER GOING BACK AGAIN

She broke down and let me in
Made me see where I'd been

Been down one time
Been down two times
I'm never going back again

You don't know what it means to win
Come 'round and see me again

Been down one time
Been down two times
I'm never going back again

AMERICAN GIRL

Well, she was an American girl
Raised on promises
She couldn't help thinkin' that there
Was a little more to life somewhere else
After all, it was a great big world
With lots of places to run to
And if she had to die tryin', she
Had one little promise she was gonna keep
Oh yeah, all right
Take it easy, baby
Make it last all night (Make it last all night)
She was an American girl

Well, it was kinda cold that night
She stood alone on her balcony (Ooh)
Yeah, she could hear the cars roll by
Out on 441 like waves crashin' on the beach
And for one desperate moment there
He crept back in her memory
God, it's so painful when something that is so close
Is still so far out of reach
Oh yeah, all right
Take it easy, baby
Make it last all night (Make it last all night)
She was an American girl (Ooh)

PIANO MAN

It's nine o'clock on a Saturday
The regular crowd shuffles in
There's an old man sittin' next to me
Makin' love to his tonic and gin
He says, "Son, can you play me a memory?
I'm not really sure how it goes
But it's sad, and it's sweet, and I knew it complete
When I wore a younger man's clothes"
La, la-la, di-dee-da
La-la, di-dee-da, da-dum

Sing us a song, you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
And you've got us feeling alright

Now John at the bar is a friend of mine
He gets me my drinks for free
And he's quick with a joke, or to light up your smoke
But there's someplace that he'd rather be
He says, "Bill, I believe this is killing me"
As the smile ran away from his face
"Well I'm sure that I could be a movie star
If I could get out of this place"
Oh, la, la-la, di-dee-da
La-la, di-dee-da, da-dum

Now Paul is a real estate novelist
Who never had time for a wife
And he's talkin' with Davy, who's still in the Navy
And probably will be for life
And the waitress is practicing politics
As the businessmen slowly get stoned
Yes, they're sharing a drink they call loneliness
But it's better than drinkin' alone


Sing us a song, you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
And you've got us feeling alright

It's a pretty good crowd for a Saturday
And the manager gives me a smile
'Cause he knows that it's me they've been comin' to see
To forget about life for a while
And the piano, it sounds like a carnival
And the microphone smells like a beer
And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar
And say, "Man, what are you doin' here?"
Oh, la, la-la, di-dee-da
La-la, di-dee-da, da-dum

Sing us a song, you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
And you've got us feeling alright

PEACE OF MIND

Now if you're feelin' kinda low 'bout the dues you've been payin'
Future's comin' much too slow
And you wanna run but somehow you just keep on stayin'
Can't decide on which way to go
I understand about indecision
But I don't care if I get behind
People living in competition
All I want is to have my peace of mind
Now you're climbing to the top of the company ladder
Hope it doesn't take too long
Can't you see there'll come a day when it won't matter
Come a day when you'll be gone

I understand about indecision
But I don't care if I get behind
People living in competition
All I want is to have my peace of mind
Take a look ahead
Take a look ahead
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Well everybody's got advice they just keep on givin'
Doesn't mean too much to me
Lots of people have to make believe they're livin'
Can't decide who they should be

I understand about indecision
But I don't care if I get behind
People living in competition
All I want is to have my peace of mind
Take a look ahead
Take a look ahead
Look ahead!

TAKE IT EASY

Well, I'm running down the road tryin' to loosen my load
I've got seven women on my mind
Four that wanna own me, two that wanna stone me
One says she's a friend of mine

Take It easy, take it easy
Don't let the sound of your own wheels drive you crazy
Lighten up while you still can
Don't even try to understand
Just find a place to make your stand and take it easy

Well, I'm a standing on a corner in Winslow, Arizona
And such a fine sight to see
It's a girl, my Lord, in a flatbed Ford
Slowin' down to take a look at me

Come on, baby, don't say maybe
I gotta know if your sweet love is gonna save me
We may lose, and we may win
Though we will never be here again
So open up, I'm climbin' in
So take it easy
Well I'm running down the road trying to loosen my load
Got a world of trouble on my mind
Lookin' for a lover who won't blow my cover
She's so hard to find

Take it easy, take it easy
Don't let the sound of your own wheels make you crazy
Come on baby, don't say maybe
I gotta know if your sweet love is gonna save me, oh oh oh
Oh we got it easy
We oughta take it easy

DECEMBER, 1963

Oh, what a night
Late December, back in '63
What a very special time for me
As I remember, what a night

Oh, what a night
You know, I didn't even know her name
But I was never gonna be the same
What a lady, what a night

Oh, I
I got a funny feeling when she walked in the room
And I
As I recall, it ended much too soon

Oh, what a night
Hypnotizing, mesmerizin' me
She was everything I dreamed she'd be
Sweet surrender, what a night

And I felt a rush like a rolling bolt of thunder
Spinning my head around
And takin' my body under
Oh, what a night
Oh, I
I got a funny feeling
When she walked in the room
And I
As I recall, it ended much too soon

Oh, what a night
Why'd it take so long to see the light?
Seemed so wrong but now it seems so right
What a lady, what a night

Oh
And I felt a rush like a rolling bolt of thunder
Spinning my head around
And takin' my body under
Oh, what a night

(Do do do do do, do do do do) Oh what a night
(Do do do do do, do do do do) Oh what a night
(Do do do do do, do do do do) Oh what a night
(Do do do do do, do do do do) Oh what a night
(Do do do do do, do do do do) Oh what a night
(Do do do do do, do do do do) Oh what a night
(Do do do do do, do do do do) Oh what a night

All our times have come
Here, but now they're gone
Seasons don't fear the reaper
Nor do the wind, the sun or the rain

(We can be like they are) Come on, baby
(Don't fear the Reaper) Baby, take my hand
(Don't fear the Reaper) We'll be able to fly
(Don't fear the Reaper) Baby, I'm your man
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la

Valentine is done
Here, but now they're gone
Romeo and Juliet
Are together in eternity (Romeo and Juliet)
40,000 men and women everyday (Like Romeo and Juliet)
40,000 men and women everyday (Redefine happiness)
Another 40,000 coming everyday
(We can be like they are) Come on, baby
(Don't fear the Reaper) Baby, take my hand
(Don't fear the Reaper) We'll be able to fly
(Don't fear the Reaper) Baby, I'm your man
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la

Love of two is one
Here, but now they're gone
Came the last night of sadness
And it was clear she couldn't go on
The door was open and the wind appeared
The candles blew and then disappeared
The curtains flew and then he appeared

(Saying, "don't be afraid") Come on, baby
(And she had no fear) And she ran to him
(Then she started to fly) They looked backward and said goodbye
(She had become like they are) She had taken his hand
(She had become like they are) Come on, baby
(Don't fear the Reaper)

HE'S THE GREATEST DANCER

Oh what, wow
He's the greatest dancer
Oh what, wow
That I've ever seen
Oh what, wow
He's the greatest dancer
Oh what, wow

One night in a disco on the outskirts of Frisco
I was cruisin' with my favorite gang
The place was so boring, filled with out-of-towners touring
I knew that it wasn't my thing
I really wasn't caring but I felt my eyes staring
At a guy who stuck out in the crowd
He had the kind of body that would shame Adonis
And a face that would make any man proud

Oh what, wow
He's the greatest dancer
Oh what, wow
That I've ever seen
Oh what, wow
He's the greatest dancer
Oh what, wow
The champion of dance, his moves would put you in a trance
And he never leaves the disco alone
Arrogance but not conceit, as a man he is complete
My crème de la crème, please take me home
He wears the finest clothes, the best designers, heaven knows
Oooh, from his head down to his toes
Halston, Gucci, Fiorucci, he looks like a still
That man is dressed to kill

Oh what, wow
He's the greatest dancer
Oh what, wow
That I've ever seen
Oh what, wow
He's the greatest dancer
Oh what, wow

JOY TO THE WORLD

Jeremiah was a bullfrog
Was a good friend of mine
I never understood a single word he said
But I helped him a-drink his wine
And he always had some mighty fine wine
Singin'

Joy to the world
All the boys and girls, now
Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea
Joy to you and me

If I were the king of the world
Tell you what I'd do
I'd throw away the cars and the bars and the wars
Make sweet love to you
Sing it now

(Joy) to the world
(All) the boys and girls
Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea
(Joy to you and me)
You know I love the ladies
Love to have my fun
I'm a high night flier and a rainbow rider (ha ha ha)
And a straight-shooting son of a gun (alright)
I said a straight shootin' (son of a gun)

(Joy to the world)
(All the boys and girls)
(Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea)
(Joy to you and me)

BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY

Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me

Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh (Any way the wind blows)
I don't wanna die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightening me
(Galileo) Galileo, (Galileo) Galileo, Galileo Figaro magnifico
But I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go
(Let him go) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let him go) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Never, never, never, never let me go) Ah
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Oh, mamma mia, mamma mia) Mamma mia, let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me!

So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby!
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here
(Ooh)
(Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah)
Nothing really matters, anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me
Any way the wind blows
