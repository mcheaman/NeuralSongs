DON'T BE CRUEL

You know I can be found
Sitting home all alone
If you can't come around
At least please telephone
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true

Baby, if I made you mad
For something I might have said
Please, let's forget the past
The future looks bright ahead
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true
I don't want no other love
Baby, it's just you I'm thinking of

Don't stop thinking of me
Don't make me feel this way
C'mon over here and love me
You know what I want you to say
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true
Why should we be apart?
I really love you, baby, cross my heart

Let's walk up to the preacher
And let us say "I do"
Then you'll know you'll have me
And I'll know that I'll have you
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true
I don't want no other love
Baby, it's just you I'm thinking of
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true
I don't want no other love
Baby, it's just you I'm thinking of

I'VE GOT YOU UNDER MY SKIN

I've got you under my skin
I've got you deep in the heart of me
So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me
I've got you under my skin
I tried so not to give in
I said to myself, 'this affair never will go so well'
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know so well
I've got you under my skin

I'd sacrifice anything, come what might
For the sake of having you near
In spite of a warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear

"Don't you know little fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality"
But each time that I do, just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
'Cause I've got you under my skin

I would sacrifice anything, come what might
For the sake of having you near
In spite of a warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats, how it yells in my ear
"Don't you know, little fool, you never can win?
Why not use your mentality? Step up, wake up to reality"
But each time I do, just the thought of you
Makes me stop just before I begin
'Cause I've got you under my skin
Yes, I've got you, under my skin

SMOKE GETS IN YOUR EYES

They asked me how I knew
My true love was true
I of course replied, something here inside
Cannot be denied
They said some day you'll find
All who love are blind
When your heart's on fire, you must realize
Smoke gets in your eyes
So I chaffed them and I gaily laughed
To think they could doubt my love
Yet today my love has flown away
I am without my love
(Without my love)
Now laughing friends deride
Tears I cannot hide, hide
So I smile and say, when a lovely flame dies
Smoke gets in your eyes
(Smoke gets in your eyes)
(Smoke gets in your eyes)
Smoke gets in your eyes!

DREAM A LITTLE DREAM OF ME

Stars shining bright above you
Night breezes seem to whisper, I love you
Birds singin' in the sycamore trees
Dream a little dream of me

Say nighty-night and kiss me
Just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me
While I'm alone and blue as can be
Dream a little dream of me

Stars fading but I linger on dear
Still craving your kiss
Now I'm longin' to linger till dawn dear
Just saying this

Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you
Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you
But in your dreams whatever they be
Dream a little dream of me

Stars fading but I linger on dear
Still craving your kiss
I'm longin' to linger till dawn dear
Just saying this
Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you
Leave the worries behind you
But in your dreams, whatever may be
You've gotta make me a promise, promise to me
You'll dream, dream a little dream of me
***************

THAT'LL BE THE DAY

Well, that'll be the day, when you say goodbye
Yes, that'll be the day, when you make me cry
You say you're going to leave, you know it's a lie
Because that'll be the day when I die

Well, you give me all your lovin' and your turtle dovin'
All your hugs and kisses and your money too
Well, you know you love me baby
Until you tell me, maybe
That someday, well I'll be through

Well, that'll be the day, when you say goodbye
Yes, that'll be the day, when you make me cry
You say you're going to leave, you know it's a lie
Because that'll be the day when I die
Well, that'll be the day, when you say goodbye
Yes, that'll be the day, when you make me cry
You say you're going to leave, you know it's a lie
Because that'll be the day when I die

Well, when Cupid shot his dart
He shot it at your heart
So if we ever part and I leave you
You sit and hold me and you tell me boldly
That someday, well I'll be blue
Well, that'll be the day, when you say goodbye
Yes, that'll be the day, when you make me cry
You say you're going to leave, you know it's a lie
Because that'll be the day when I die

Well, that'll be the day, hoo-hoo
That'll be the day, hoo-hoo
That'll be the day, hoo-hoo
That'll be the day

I'LL LOOK AROUND

I'll look around until I've found
Someone who laughs like you
I know somewhere spring must fill the air
With sweetness just as rare
As the flower that you gave me to wear
I look around and when I've found
Someone who sighs like you
I'll know this love I'm dreaming of
Won't be the old love I always knew
***************

I FALL IN LOVE TOO EASILY

I fall in love too easily
I fall in love too fast
I fall in love too terribly hard
For love to ever last
My heart should be well-schooled
'Cause I've been fooled in the past
But still I fall in love so easily
I fall in love too fast
My heart should be well-schooled
'Cause I've been fooled in the past
But still I fall in love too easily
I fall in love too fast
***************

PUT YOUR HEAD ON MY SHOULDER

Put your head on my shoulder
Hold me in your arms, baby
Squeeze me oh so tight
Show me that you love me too

Put your lips next to mine, dear
Won't you kiss me once, baby
Just a kiss goodnight, maybe
You and I will fall in love
(You and I will fall in love)

People say that love's a game
A game you just can't win
If there's a way
I'll find it someday
And then this fool will rush in

Put your head on my shoulder
Whisper in my ear, baby
Words I want to hear
Tell me, tell me that you love me too
(Tell me that you love me too)
Put your head on my shoulder
Whisper in my ear, baby
Words I want to hear, baby
Put your head on my shoulder

ISN'T THIS A LOVELY DAY?

The weather is fright'ning
The thunder and lightning
Seem to be having their way
But as far as I'm concerned, it's a lovely day
The turn in the weather
Will keep us together
So i can honestly say
That as far as i'm concerned, it's a lovely day
And everything's okay
Isn't this a lovely day
To be caught in the rain?
You were going on your way
Now you've got to remain
Just as you were going, leaving me all at sea
The clouds broke, they broke and oh
What a break for me
I can see the sun up high
Though we're caught in the storm
I can see where you and i
Could be cozy and warm
Let the rain pitter patter
But it really doesn't matter
If the skies are gray
Long as I can be with you it's a lovely day
***************

PENNIES FROM HEAVEN

If every time it rains, it rains, pennies from heaven (Shubby Dobby)
Don't you know each cloud contains pennies from heaven (Shubby Dobby)
You'll find your fortune falling all over town
Each red and yella umbrella is up up up up upside down and...
Trade them all for a pack of a gum, sunshine and ravioli (Macaroni)
If you want the thing you love, you must have a pizzioli baby
And when you hear thunder don't run under a tree
It be pennies from heaven, for you and for me
Now come over here boy, Sam
And every time it rains it rains
And don't you know each cloud contains
Every time it rains, it rains
And don't you know each cloud contains
You find your fortune falling
All over town, all over town, all over town
Each red and yella umbrella

A TEENAGER'S ROMANCE

Bah, bah, bah, but
Bah, bah, bah, but
Bah, bah, bah, bah. bah. bah, but
Do do do do do do
Bah, bah, bah, but
Bah, bah, bah, but
Bah, bah, bah, bah. bah. bah, but
A teenager's romance is fickle or true
A teenager's romance is red hot or blue
You're either in misery or high on a crest
A teenager's romance is like all the rest
They tell us we're different
We haven't the right
To decide for ourselves, dear
What's black and what's white
Keep saying you love me
And they'll look upon
A teenager's romance
That goes on and on
They tell us we're different
We haven't the right
To decide for ourselves, dear
What's black and what's white
Keep saying you love me
And they'll look upon
A teenager's romance
That goes on and on
A teenager's romance
That goes on and on

BLACK COFFEE

I'm feelin' mighty lonesome
Haven't slept a wink
I walk the floor and watch the door
And in between I drink
Black coffee
Love's a hand-me-down brew
I'll never know a Sunday in this weekday room
I'm talkin to the shadows
One o'clock till four
And Lord, how slow the moments go
When all I do is pour
Black coffee
Since the blues caught my eye
I'm hangin' out on Monday, my Sunday dreams to dry
Now a man is born to go a-lovin'
A woman's born to weep and fret
And stay at home to tend her oven
And down her past regrets
In coffee and cigarettes
I'm moanin' all the morning
Moanin' all the night
And in between it's nicotine
And not much heart to fight
Black coffee
Feelin' low as the ground
It's drivin' me crazy
This waitin' for my baby
To maybe come around
***************

A TEENAGER IN LOVE

Each time we have a quarrel
It almost breaks my heart
'Cause I'm so afraid
That we will have to part

Each night I ask the stars up above
Why must I be a teenager in love?

One day, I feel so happy
The next day, I feel so sad
I guess I'll learn to take
The good with the bad

'Cause each night I ask the stars up above
Why must I be a teenager in love?

I cried a tear
For nobody but you
I'll be a lonely one
If you should say we're through
Well, if you want to make me cry
That won't be so hard to do
If you should say goodbye
I'll still go on loving you

Each night I ask the stars up above
Why must I be a teenager in love?

I cried a tear
For nobody but you
I'll be a lonely one
If you should say we're through

Well, if you want to make me cry
That won't be so hard to do
And if you should say goodbye
I'll still go on loving you

Each night I ask the stars up above
Why must I be a teenager in love?
(In love) Why must I be a teenager in love?
(In love) Why must I be a teenager in love?
(In love) Why must I be a teenager in love?

APRIL IN PARIS

April in Paris, chestnuts in blossom
Holiday tables under the trees
April in Paris, this is a feeling
That no one can ever reprise
I never knew the charm of spring
Never met it face to face
I never knew my heart could sing
Never missed a warm embrace
Till April in Paris
Whom can I run to
What have you done to
My heart
I never knew the charm of spring
Never met it face to face
I never knew my heart could sing
Never missed a warm embrace
Till April in Paris
Whom can I run to
What did you mean to
What have you done to
My heart

MR. BLUE

Our guardian star lost all his glow
The day that I lost you
He lost all his glitter the day you said no
And his silver turned to blue
Like him, I am doubtful
That your love is true
But if you decide to call on me
Ask for Mr. Blue
I'm Mr. Blue
When you say you love me
Then prove it by going out on the sly
Proving your love isn't true
Call me Mr. Blue
I'm Mr. Blue
When you say you're sorry
Then turn around, heading for the lights of town
Hurtin' me through and through
Call me Mr. Blue
I stay at home at night
Right by the phone at night
But you won't call
And I won't hurt my pride
Call me Mr
I won't tell you
While you paint the town
A bright red to turn it upside down
I'm painting it too
But I'm painting it blue
Call me Mr. Blue
Call me Mr. Blue
Call me Mr. Blue
***************

BLUE SKIES

Blue skies smiling at me
Nothing but blue skies do I see
Bluebirds singing a song
Nothing but bluebirds all day long
Never saw the sun shining so bright
Never saw things going so right
Noticing the days hurrying by
When you're in love, my how they fly
Blue days, all of them gone
Nothing but blue skies from now on
Never saw the sun shining so bright
Never saw things going so right
Noticing the days hurrying by
When you're in love, my how they fly
Blue days, all of them gone
Nothing but blue skies from now on
***************

IT'S NOT FOR ME TO SAY

It's not for me to say, you love me
It's not for me to say, you'll always care
Oh.. but here for the moment
I can hold you fast
And press your lips to mine
And dream that love will last
As far as I can see, this is heaven
And speaking just for me, It's ours to share
Perhaps the glow
Of love will grow
With every passing day
Or we may never meet again
But then
It's not for me to say
(Break)
And speaking just for me
It's ours to share
Perhaps the glow
Of love will grow
With every passing day
Or we may never meet again
But then
It's not for me to say

LONESOME TOWN

There's a place where lovers go
To cry their troubles away
And they call it Lonesome Town
Where the broken hearts stay

You can buy a dream or two
To last you all through the years
And the only price you pay
Is a heart full of tears

Goin' down to Lonesome town
Where the broken hearts stay
Goin' down to Lonesome town
To cry my troubles away

In the town of broken dreams
The streets are filled with regret
Maybe down in Lonesome Town
I can learn to forget (To forget)

Maybe down in Lonesome Town
I can learn to forget
(Lonesome Town)

YOU MAKE ME FEEL SO YOUNG

You make me feel so young
You make me feel so spring has sprung
And every time I see you grin
I'm such a happy individual
The moment that you speak
I wanna go play hide-and-seek
I wanna go and bounce the moon
Just like a toy balloon
You and I are just like a couple of tots
Running across the meadow
Picking up lots of forget-me-nots
You make me feel so young
You make me feel there are songs to be sung
Bells to be rung
And a wonderful fling to be flung
And even when I'm old and gray
I'm gonna feel the way I do today
'Cause you make me feel so young
You make me feel so young
You make me feel so spring has sprung
And every time I see you grin
I'm such a happy individual
The moment that you speak
I wanna go play hide-and-seek
I wanna go and bounce the moon
Just like a toy balloon
You and I are just like a couple of tots
Running across the meadow
Picking up lots of forget-me-nots
You make me feel so young
You make me feel there are songs to be sung
Bells to be rung
Wonderful fling to be flung
And even when I'm old and gray
I'm gonna feel the way I do today
'Cause you, you make me feel so young
You make me feel so young
You make me feel so young
Ooh, you make me feel so young

I GET ALONG WITHOUT YOU VERY WELL

I get along without you very well
Of course I do
Except when soft rains fall
And drip from leaves that I recall
The thrill of being sheltered in your arms
Of course I do
But I get along without you very well
I've forgotten you just like I should
Of course I have
Except to hear your name
Or someones laugh that is the same
But I've forgotten you just like I should
What a guy
What a fool am I
To think my breaking heart could kid the moon
Whats in store
Should I fall once more
No its best that I stick to my tune
I get along without you very well
Of course I do
Except perhaps in spring
But I should never think of spring
For that would surely break my heart in two

AUTUMN IN NEW YORK

Autumn in New York, why does it seem so inviting?
Autumn in New York, it spells the thrill of first-nighting
Glittering crowds and shimmering clouds in canyons of steel;
They're making me feel: I'm home
It's autumn in New York that brings the promise of new love
Autumn in New York is often mingled with pain
Dreamers with empty hands may sigh for exotic lands;
It's autumn in New York;
It's good to live it again
Autumn in New York, the gleaming rooftops at sundown
Autumn in New York, it lifts you up when you're let down
Jaded roués and gay divorcee who lunch at the Ritz
Will tell you that it's devine
It's autumn in New York transforms the slums into Mayfair
Autumn in New York, you'll need no castle in Spain
Lovers that bless the dark
On benches in Central Park
Greet autumn in New York
It's good to live it again
***************

THE NEARNESS OF YOU

It's not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no
It's just the nearness of you
It isn't your sweet conversation
That brings this sensation, oh no
It's just the nearness of you
When you're in my arms
And I feel you so close to me
All my wildest dreams come true
I need no soft lights to enchant me
If you'll only grant me the right
To hold you ever so tight
And to feel in the night the nearness of you

It's not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no
It's just the nearness of you
It isn't your sweet conversation
That brings this sensation, oh no
It's just the nearness of you
When you're in my arms
And I feel you so close to me
All my wildest dreams come true, yeah
I need no soft lights to enchant me
If you'll only grant me the right
To hold you ever so tight, yeah baby
And to feel in the night the nearness of you

When you're in my arms
And I feel you so close to me
All my wildest dreams come true
I need no soft lights to enchant me
If you'll only grant me the right
To hold you ever so tight

DREAM A LITTLE DREAM OF ME

Stars shining bright above you
Night breezes seem to whisper, "I love you."
Birds singing in the sycamore trees
Dream a little dream of me
Say, "Nightie-night" and kiss me
Just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me
While I'm alone and blue as can be
Dream a little dream of me
Stars fading but I linger on, dear
Still craving your kiss
I'm longing to linger till dawn, dear
Just saying this
"Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you
Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you
But in your dreams whatever they be
Dream a little dream of me"

16 CANDLES

Happy birthday, happy birthday, baby
Oh, I love you so
Sixteen candles make a lovely light

You're only sixteen (sixteen)
But you're my teenage queen (you're my queen)
You're the prettiest, loveliest girl I've ever seen (I've ever seen) (OH!)
Sixteen candles in my heart will glow
For ever and ever for I love you so (for I love you so)
You're only sixteen (sixteen)
But you're my teenage queen (you're my queen)
Oh, you're the prettiest, loveliest girl I've ever seen (I've ever seen)
Sixteen candles in my heart will glow
For ever and ever for I love you so (for I love you so)
For I love you so!

MANHATTAN

Summer journeys
To Niagara
And to other places
Aggravate all our cares
We'll save our fares
I've a cozy little flat
In what is known as old Manhattan
We'll settle down
Right here in town
We'll have Manhattan
The Bronx and Staten Island, too
It's lovely going through
The zoo
It's very fancy
On old Delancey Street, you know
The subway charms us so
When balmy breezes blow
To and fro
And tell me what street
Compares with Mott Street
In July
Sweet pushcarts gently gliding by
The great big city's a wondrous toy
Just made for a girl and boy
We'll turn Manhattan
Into an isle of joy
We'll go to Greenwich
Where modern men itch
To be free
And Bowling Green you'll see
With me
We'll bathe at Brighton
The fish you'll frighten
When you're in
Your bathing suit so thin
Will make the shellfish grin
Fin to fin
I'd like to take a
Sail on Jamaica Bay with you
And fair Canarsie's lake
We'll view
The city's bustle cannot destroy
The dreams of a girl and boy
We'll turn Manhattan
Into an isle of joy
We'll go to Yonkers
Where true love conquers
In the wilds
And starve together, dear
In Childs'
We'll go to Coney
And eat baloney
On a roll
In Central Park we'll stroll
Where our first kiss we stole
Soul to soul
Our future babies
We'll take to "Abie's Irish Rose"
I hope they'll live to see
It close
The city's clamor can never spoil
The dreams of a boy and goil
We'll turn Manhattan
Into an isle of joy
We'll have Manhattan
The Bronx and Staten Island, too
We'll try to cross Fifth Avenue
As black as onyx
We'll find the Bronnix Park Express
Our Flatbush flat, I guess
Will be a great success
More or less
A short vacation
On Inspiration Point
We'll spend
And in the station house we'll end
But civic virtue cannot destroy
The dreams of a girl and boy
We'll turn Manhattan
Into an isle of joy
***************

LOVE IS HERE TO STAY

It's very clear, our love is here to stay
Not for a year. But, ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passin' fancies, and in time may go...
But, Ooooh my dear, our love is here to stay
Together we're - goin' a long, long way
In time The Rockies may crumble - Gibralter may tumble
They're only made of clay
But, our love is here to stay...
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passin' fancy's anytime they go...
But, Ooooh my dear, our love is here to stay
Together we're - goin' a long, long way
In time The Rockies may crumble and that Gibralter it may tumble
They're only made of clay
But, our love, our love is here to stay
***************

CRAZY HE CALLS ME

I say I'll move the mountains
And I'll move the mountains
If he wants them out of the way
Crazy he calls me
Sure, I'm crazy
Crazy in love, I say
I say I'll go through fire
And I'll go through fire
As he wants it, so it will be
Crazy he calls me
Sure, I'm crazy
Crazy in love, you see
Like the wind that shakes the bough
He moves me with a smile
The difficult I'll do right now
The impossible will take a little while
I say I'll care forever
And I mean forever
If I have to hold up the sky
Crazy he calls me
Sure, I'm crazy
Crazy in love am I
***************

MISTY

Look at me
I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
And I feel like I'm clinging to a cloud
I can't understand
I get misty just holding your hand

Walk my way
And a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear
I get misty the moment you're near

You can say that you're leading me on
But it's just what I want you to do
Don't you notice how hopelessly I'm lost?
That's why I'm following you

On my own
Would I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove
I'm too misty and too much in love
I'm too misty and too much in love
Look at me
***************

THEY CAN'T TAKE THAT AWAY FROM ME

"Our romance won't end on a sorrowful note
Though by tomorrow you're gone
The song has ended but as the songwriter wrote
The melody lingers on
They may take you from me
I'll miss your fond caress
But though they take you from me
I'll still possess...
The way you wear your hat
The way you sip your tea
The memory of all that
No they can't take that away from me
The way your smile just beams
The way you sing off key
The way you haunt my dreams
No, no they can't take that away from me
We may never never meet again, on that bumpy road to love
Still I'll always, always keep the memory of
The way you hold your knife
The way we danced till three
The way you changed my life
No, no they can't take that away from me
No, they can't take that away from me."
***************

TO THE AISLE

First a boy and a girl meet each other
Then they sit down to talk for a while
In your heart, you'll want her for a lover
While each step, draws you closer to the aisle
You may start with a simple conversation
My darling, please put me on trial
She says, yes and your heart starts beating
While each step, draws you closer to the aisle
You ask her if she loves you she answers, "I do"
Your heart starts glowing inside
And then you will know she is just for you
While each step, draws you closer to the aisle
Then you put a ring on her finger
And the tears start flowing awhile
Then you'll know she's yours forever
While each step, draws you closer to the aisle
She says, yes and your heart starts beating
While each step, draws you closer to the aisle
***************

WE BELONG TOGETHER

You're mine
And we belong together
Yes, we belong together
For eternity
You're mine
Your lips belong to me
Yes, they belong to only me
For eternity
You're mine, my baby
And you'll always be
I swear by everything I own
You'll always, always be mine
You're mine
And we belong together
Yes, we belong together
For eternity
***************

I'VE GOT THE WORLD ON A STRING

I've got the world on a string
Sitting on a rainbow
Got the string around my finger
What a world, what a life, I'm in love

I've got a song that I sing
I can make the rain go
Anytime I move my finger
Lucky me, can't you see, I'm in love

Life is a beautiful thing
As long as I hold the string
I'd be a silly so-and-so
If I should ever let it go

I've got the world on a string
Sitting on a rainbow
Got the string around my finger
What a world, what a life, I'm in love

Life is a beautiful thing
As long as I hold the string
I'd be a silly so-and-so
If I should ever let it go
I got the world on a string
Sitting on a rainbow
Got the string around my finger
What a world
And this is the life
Hey now
I'm so in love
***************

BEYOND THE SEA

Somewhere beyond the sea
Somewhere waiting for me
My lover stands on golden sands
And watches the ships that go sailing
Somewhere beyond the sea
She's there watching for me
If I could fly like birds on high
Then straight to her arms
I'd go sailing
It's far beyond the stars
It's near beyond the moon
I know beyond a doubt
My heart will lead me there soon
We'll meet beyond the shore
We'll kiss just as before
Happy we'll be beyond the sea
And never again I'll go sailing
I know beyond a doubt
My heart will lead me there soon
We'll meet (I know we'll meet) beyond the shore
We'll kiss just as before
Happy we'll be beyond the sea
And never again I'll go sailing
No more sailing
So long sailing
Bye, bye sailing...

EARTH ANGEL

Earth angel, earth angel
Will you be mine?
My darling dear, love you all the time
I'm just a fool, a fool in love with you

Earth angel, earth angel
The one I adore
Love you forever, and ever more
I'm just a fool, a fool in love with you

I fell for you and I knew
The vision of your love, loveliness
I hope and I pray that someday
I'll be the vision of your happiness

Oh, earth angel, earth angel

TEACH ME TONIGHT

Did you say I had a lot to learn?
Well, don't think I'm trying not to learn
Since this is the perfect spot to learn
Trying to find somebody to teach me tonight
We'll start with the A B C of it
Then we'll roll down to the X Y Z of it
Help me solve the mystery of it
Oh, come on and teach me tonight
Well the sky's a blackboard (and I don't mean jungle) high above you
And if a shooting star goes by
I'll use that star to write I love you
A thousand times across the sky
One thing isn't very clear, my love
Should the teacher stand so near, my love?
Graduation's almost here, my love
Yeah, yeah teach me tonight
Well the sky's a blackboard, high above you
And if an astronaut zooms by
I'll reach and grab him real fast
Then write I love you a thousand times across the sky
One thing isn't very clear, my love
I know you're wondering how I switched that key, my love
Graduation's almost here, my love
Teach me
Teach me
Come on
And teach me tonight

BLUE MOON

Blue moon
You saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon
You knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper
Please adore me
And when I looked
The moon had turned to gold
Blue moon
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon
You saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon
You knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for
Someone I really could care for
And then they suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper
Please adore me
And when I looked
The moon had turned to gold
Blue moon
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon

CAN'T WE BE FRIENDS?

I thought I'd found the man of my dreams
Now it seems, this is how the story ends
He's going to turn me down and say
"Can't we be friends?"

I thought for once it couldn't go wrong
Not for long! I can see the way this ends
He's going to turn me down and say
"Can't we be friends?"

Never again, through with love
Through with men
They play their game without shame
And who's to blame?

I thought I'd found a man I could trust
What a bust, this is how the story ends
He's going to turn me down and say
"Can't we be friends?"

Yes, I thought I knew the wheat from the chaff
What a laugh, this is how our story ends
I'll let her turn me down and say
"Can't we be friends?"
I acted like a kid out of school
What a fool, now I see this is the end
I'll let her turn me down and say
"Can't we be friends?"

Oh, what should I give?
Though he gave me the air
Why should I cry?
He was sigh and wonder why

Yes, I should have seen the signal to stop
What a flop, this is how the story ends
She's gonna turn me down and say
"Can't we be friends?"

What should I give?
Though he gave me the air
And why should I cry?
He was sigh and wonder why

I should have seen the signal to stop
What a flop, this is how the story ends
I let him turn me down and say
Can't we be, can't we be, can't we be
Can't we be, can't we be, can't we be friends?
Oh, yes

MY FUNNY VALENTINE

My funny valentine
Sweet comic valentine
You make me smile with my heart
Your looks are laughable
Unphotographable
Yet you're my favourite work of art
Is your figure less than greek
Is your mouth a little weak
When you open it to speak
Are you smart?
But don't change a hair for me
Not if you care for me
Stay little valentine stay
Each day is valentines day
Is your figure less than greek
Is your mouth a little weak
When you open it to speak
Are you smart?
But don't you change one hair for me
Not if you care for me
Stay little valentine stay
Each day is valentines day

TENNESSEE WALTZ

I was dancing with my darling to the Tennessee Waltz
When an old friend I happened to see
Introduced her to my loved one and while they were dancing
My friend stole my sweetheart from me
I remember the night and the Tennessee Waltz
Now I know just how much I have lost
Yes, I lost my little darling on the night they were playing
The beautiful Tennessee Waltz
I was dancing with my darling to the Tennessee Waltz

YOU BELONG TO ME

See the pyramids along the Nile
Watch the sun rise on a tropic isle
Just remember, darling, all the while
You belong to me
See the marketplace in old Algiers
Send me photographs and souvenirs
Just remember when a dream appears
You belong to me
I'll be so alone without you
Maybe you'll be lonesome too, and blue
Fly the ocean in a silver plane
See the jungle when it's wet with rain
Just remember till you're home again
You belong to me
I'll be so alone without you
Maybe you'll be lonesome too, and blue
Fly the ocean in a silver plane
Watch the jungle when it's wet with rain
But remember darling, till you're home again
You belong to me

STRANGE FRUIT

Southern trees bear a strange fruit
Blood on the leaves and blood at the root
Black bodies swinging in the southern breeze
Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees

Pastoral scene of the gallant south
The bulging eyes and the twisted mouth
Scent of magnolias, sweet and fresh
Then the sudden smell of burning flesh

Here is a fruit for the crows to pluck
For the rain to gather, for the wind to suck
For the sun to rot, for the tree to drop
Here is a strange and bitter crop
***************

JUST IN TIME

Just in time, I found you just in time
Before you came my time was running low
I was lost, the losing dice were tossed
My bridges all were crossed, no where to go
Now you're here, now I know just where I'm going
No more doubt or fears I've found my way
For love came just in time
You found me just in time
And changed my lonely life that lucky day
Now you're here, now I know just where I'm going
No more doubt or fears I've found my way
For love came just in time
You found me just in time
And changed my lonely life that lucky day

I'M GONNA GET MARRIED

(Johnny, Johnny, Johnny)
(Johnny, you're too young)
But I'm gonna get married
(You're so young)
My name she'll carry
(You're too young Johnny, you're so smart)
But not smart enough to hide an aching heart
How come my heart deserts me
Burning full of love and desire
How come every time she kiss me
It sets my soul on fire
How come every time she leave me
It seems like I've lost a part
I may be too young to marry
But not to hide an aching heart
(Johnny, you're too young)
But I'm gonna get married
(You're so young)
My name she'll carry
(You're too young Johnny, you're so smart)
But not smart enough to hide an aching heart
How come every time she kiss me
It thrills me from head to toe
How come every time I see her
It lifts me right off the floor
How come every time I'm with her
She whispers so soft and low
It makes me want to jump and holler
And bump my head into a door
(Johnny, you're too young)
But I'm gonna get married
(You're so young)
My name she'll carry
(You're too young, and Johnny, you're so smart)
But not smart enough to hide an aching heart
(Too young)
I'm gonna get married
(You're so young)
My name she'll carry
(You're too young)
But I'm gonna get married
(You're so young)
My name she'll carry
(You're too young)

COME FLY WITH ME

Come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away
If you can use some exotic booze, there's a bar in far Bombay
Come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away

Come fly with me, let's float down to Peru
In llama land, there's a one man band, and he'll toot his flute for you
Come fly with me, let's take off in the blue

Once I get you up there, where the air is rarefied
We'll just glide, starry-eyed
Once I get you up there, I'll be holding you so near
You may hear angels cheer 'cause we're together

Weather wise, it's such a lovely day
Just say the words and we'll beat the birds down to Acapulco Bay
It's perfect for a flying honeymoon, they say
Come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away


Once I get you up there, where the air is rarefied

CHEEK TO CHEEK

Heaven, I'm in heaven
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek
Heaven, I'm in heaven
And the cares that hung around me through the week
Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak
When we're out together dancing (swinging) cheek to cheek
Oh I love to climb a mountain
And reach the highest peak
But it doesn't thrill (boot) me half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek
Oh I love to go out fishing
In a river or a creek
But I don't enjoy it half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek
Now Mamma Dance with me
I want my arm(s) about you
That (Those) charm(s) about you
Will carry me through...
(Right up) To heaven, I'm in heaven
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When we're out together dancing, out together dancing (swinging)
Out together dancing cheek to cheek

I GET A KICK OUT OF YOU

My story is much to sad to be told
But practically everything leaves me totally cold
The only exception I know is the case
When Im out on a quiet spree, fighting vainly the old ennui
Then I suddenly turn and see
Your fabulous face
I get no kick from champagne
Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all
So tell me why should it be true
That I get a kick out of you
Some, they may go for cocaine
I'm sure that if I took even one sniff
It would bore me terrifically, too
Yet I get a kick out of you
I get a kick every time I see you
Standing there before me
I get a kick though it's clear to see
You obviously don't adore me
I get no kick in a plane
Flyin' too high with some gal in the sky is my idea of nothing to do
Yet I get a kick
You give me a boot
I get a kick out of you

SPLISH SPLASH

Splish splash, I was taking a bath
Long about a Saturday night, yeah
A rub dub, just relaxing in the tub
Thinking everything was alright
Well, I stepped out the tub, put my feet on the floor
I wrapped the towel around me
And I opened the door, and then a
Splish, splash, I jumped back in the bath
Well, how was I to know there was a party going on?
They was a-splishing and a-splashing
Reeling with the feeling
Moving and a-grooving
Rocking and a-rolling, yeah
Bing bang, I saw the whole gang
Dancing on my living room rug, yeah
Flip flop, they was doing the bop
All the teens had the dancing bug
There was Lollipop with-a Peggy Sue
Good golly, Miss Molly was-a even there, too
A-well-a, splish splash, I forgot about the bath
I went and put my dancing shoes on, yeah
I was a rolling and a-strolling
Reeling with the feeling
Moving and a-grooving
Splishing and a-splashing, yeah
Yes, I was a-splishing and a-splashing
I was a-rolling and a-strolling
Yeah, I was a-moving and a-grooving
We was a-reeling with the feeling
We was a-rolling and a-strolling
Moving with the grooving
Splish splash, yeah
Mm, splishing and a-splashing, one time
I was a-splishing and a-splashing, ooh wee
I was a-moving and a-grooving, yeah
I was a-splishing and a-splashing

SMILE

Smile though your heart is aching
Smile even though it's breaking
When there are clouds in the sky, you'll get by
If you smile through your fear and sorrow
Smile and maybe tomorrow
You'll see the sun come shining through for you

Light up your face with gladness
Hide every trace of sadness
Although a tear may be ever so near
That's the time you must keep on trying
Smile, what's the use of crying?
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just smile
That's the time you must keep on trying
Smile, what's the use of crying?
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just smile

YOU'LL NEVER NEVER KNOW

(You'll never know)
You'll never, never know I care
You'll never know the torch I bear
You'll never know it, for I won't show it
Oh, no, you'll never, never know
(You'll never know)
You'll never, never see me cry
Not even when you're glancing by
For I won't weaken, when we're speaking
Oh, no, you'll never, never know
You'll know the used to me
That I was before
You'll see the used to be
That one you did adore
(You'll never know)
No, no I know I won't reveal
The way I really truly feel
But if you guess it
I'll confess it
Oh, darling nows the time to glow
Or else you'll never, never know
You'll know the used to me
That I was before
You'll see the used to be
That one you did adore
(You'll never know)
No, no I know I won't reveal
The way I really truly feel

PASSING STRANGERS

We seem like passing strangers now
How can you hurry by?
There were never two who loved
Half as much as you and I
We seem like passing strangers now
Funny, how things can change
We were so inseparable
Now you're acting very strange
The hands I used to touch
Don't even wave hello
How I miss your lips
You'll never know
If you would only turn to me
Speak my name just once more
You might find right there and then
Strangers can be lovers again
The hands I used to touch
Don't even wave hello
How I miss your lips
You'll never know
If you would only turn to me
Speak my name just once more
You might find right there and then
Strangers can be lovers again

I WONDER WHY

(Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun d-d-duh-duh-duh)
 know why I love you like I do (D-d-dun d-d-dah),  know why I do
(D-duh)
Don't know why I love you, don't know why I care
I just want, your love to share
I wonder why, I love you like I do
Is it because I think you love me too?
I wonder why, I love you like I do, like I do
I told my friends that we would never part
They often said that you would break my heart
I wonder why they think that we will part, we will part
When you're with me, I'm sure you're always true
When I'm away, I wonder what you do
I wonder why I'm sure you're always true, always true
Don't know why I do
(The d-duns, d-dahs, and doo-wops continue throughout the song both upfront and in the background so mentally fill them in for yourself, thank you)

I ONLY HAVE EYES FOR YOU

My love must be a kind of blind love;
I can't see anyone but you
Sha bop sha bop
Sha bop sha bop
Sha bop sha bop
Sha bop sha bop
Are the stars out tonight
(Sha bop sha bop)
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright
(Sha bop sha bop)
I only have eyes for you, dear
(Sha bop sha bop)
(Sha bop sha bop)
The moon may be high
(Sha bop sha bop)
But I can't see a thing in the sky
(Sha bop sha bop)
I only have eyes for you
I don't know if we're in a garden
Or on a crowded avenue
(Sha bop sha bop)
You are here and so am I
Maybe millions of people go by
But they all disappear from view
And I only have eyes for you
(Sha bop sha bop)

CHANCES ARE

Chances are, 'cause I wear a silly grin
The moment you come into view
Chances are you think that I'm in love with you
Just because my composure sort of slips
The moment that your lips meet mine
Chances are you think my heart's your valentine
In the magic of moonlight
When I sigh, "Hold me close, dear"
Chances are you'll believe the stars
That fill the skies are in my eyes
Guess you feel you'll always be
The one and only one for me
And if you think you could
Well, chances are your chances are awfully good
Chances are you'll believe the stars
That fill the skies are in my eyes
Guess you feel you'll always be
The one and only one for me
And if you think you could
Well, chances are your chances are awfully good
The chances are your chances are awfully good

UNFORGETTABLE

Unforgettable
That's what you are
Unforgettable
Tho' near or far

Like a song of love that clings to me
How the thought of you does things to me
Never before
Has someone been more...

Unforgettable
In every way
And forever more
That's how you'll stay

That's why, darling, it's incredible
That someone so unforgettable
Thinks that I am
Unforgettable, too

Unforgettable
In every way
And forever more
That's how you'll stay

MR. LONELY

Lonely, I'm Mr. Lonely
I have nobody for my own
I am so lonely, I'm Mr. Lonely
Wish I had someone to call on the phone

Now I'm a soldier, a lonely soldier
Away from home through no wish of my own
That's why I'm lonely, I'm Mr. Lonely
I wish that I could go back home

Letters, never a letter
I get no letters in the mail
I've been forgotten, yes, forgotten
Oh, how I wonder, how is it I failed

Now I'm a soldier, a lonely soldier
Away from home through no wish of my own
That's why I'm lonely, I'm Mr. Lonely
I wish that I could go back home

TWILIGHT TIME

Heavenly shades of night are falling
It's twilight time
Out of the mist your voice is calling
'Tis twilight time
When purple colored curtains
Mark the end of day
I'll hear you my dear at twilight time
Deepening shadows gather splendor
As day is done
Fingers of night will soon surrender
The setting sun
I count the moments darling
'Till you're here with me
Together at last at twilight time
Here in the afterglow of day
We keep our rendezvous beneath the blue
Here in the sweet and same old way
I fall in love again as I did then
Deep in the dark your kiss will thrill me
Like days of old
Lighting the spark of love that fills me
With dreams untold
Each day I pray for evening just
To be with you
Together at last at twilight time
Here in the afterglow of day
We keep our rendezvous beneath the blue
Here in the sweet and same old way
I fall in love again as I did then
Deep in the dark your kiss will thrill me
Like days of old
Lighting the spark of love that fills me
With dreams untold
Each day I pray for evening just
To be with you
Together at last at twilight time
Together at last at twilight time

RAGS TO RICHES

I know I'd go from rages to riches
If you would only say you care
And though my pocket may be empty
I'd be a millionaire

My clothes may still be torn and tattered
But in my heart I'd be a king
Your love is all that ever mattered
It's everything

So open your arms and you'll open the door
To every treasure I'm hoping for
Hold me and kiss me and tell me you're mine evermore

Must I forever be a begger
Whose golden dreams will not come true
Or will I go from rags to riches
My fate is up to you

STUPID CUPID

Stupid cupid
You're a real mean guy
I'd like to clip your wings
So you can't fly
I'm in love
And it's a crying shame
And I know that you're the one to blame
Hey, hey
Set me free
Stupid cupid
Stop picking on me
I can't do my homework
And I can't think straight
I meet him every morning
'Bout a half past eight
I'm acting like a lovesick fool
You've even got me carrying his books to school
Hey, hey
Set me free
Stupid cupid
Stop picking on me
You mixed me up
But good
Right from the very start
Hey, go play Robin Hood with somebody else's heart
You've got me jumping
Like a crazy clown
And I don't feature what you're putting down
Since I kissed his loving lips of wine
The thing that bothers me is that I like it fine
Hey, hey

TEARS ON MY PILLOW

You don't remember me, but I remember you
'twas not so long ago, you broke my heart in two
Tears on my pillow, pain in my heart, caused by you, you
If we could start anew, I wouldn't hesitate
I'd gladly take you back, and tempt the hand of fate
Tears on my pillow, pain in my heart, caused by you
Love is not a gadget, love is not a toy
When you find the one you love, she'll fill your heart with joy
If we could start anew, I wouldn't hesitate
I'd gladly take you back, and tempt the hands of fate
Tears on my pillow, pain in my heart, caused by you, you
Oh wo wo wo you you

I SAW THE LIGHT

I wandered so aimless life filled with sin
I wouldn't let my dear savior in
Then Jesus came like a stranger in the night
Praise the Lord I saw the light

I saw the light I saw the light
No more darkness no more night
Now I'm so happy no sorrow in sight
Praise the Lord I saw the light

Just like a blind man I wandered along
Worries and fears I claimed for my own
Then like the blind man that God gave back his sight
Praise the Lord I saw the light

I saw the light I saw the light
No more darkness no more night
Now I'm so happy no sorrow in sight
Praise the Lord I saw the light

I was a fool to wander and a-stray
Straight is the gate and narrow the way
Now I have traded the wrong for the right
Praise the Lord I saw the light
I saw the light I saw the light
No more darkness no more night
Now I'm so happy no sorrow in sight
Praise the Lord I saw the light

AIN'T THAT A SHAME

You made me cry
When you said, "good-bye"
Ain't that a shame?
My tears fell like rain
Ain't that a shame?
You're the one to blame

You broke my heart
When you said we'll part
Ain't that a shame?
My tears fell like rain
Ain't that a shame?
You're the one to blame

Oh, well, goodbye
Although I'll cry
Ain't that a shame?
My tears fell like rain

BROKEN HEARTED MELODY

Br-oooo-ken hearted me-eee-lo-dy
Ooooonce you were our song of love
Nooooow you just keep taunting me
Wiiiiith the memory of (ba-da-da)
His tender love. Ooooh
Broken hearted melody
Must you keep reminding me
Of the lips I long to kiss
And the love I miss since he went away
Night and day they play
That broken hearted melody
That he used to sing to me
When our love was young and bright
As he held me tight
Suddenly I found, I was heaven bound
Brooooken hearted melody
Ooooonce you were our song of love
Nooooow you just keep taunting me
Wiiiiiith the memory of (ba-da-da)
His tender love, Ooooh
Broken hearted melody
Won't you bring him back to me
Sing to him until he yearns
For when he returns no more will he be
A broken hearted melody
Oooooooo, oo-oo
Oo-oo, oo-oo, ooooooooo
Oooooooo, oo-oo
Oo-oo, oo-oo, ooooooooo

ON THE STREET WHERE YOU LIVE

Oh, the towering feeling
Just to know somehow you are near
I have often walked on this street before
But the pavement always stayed beneath my feet before
All at once am I several stories high
Knowing I'm on the street where you live
Are there lilac trees in the heart of town?
Can you hear a lark in any other part of town?
Does enchantment pour out of every door?
No, it's just on the street where you live
Oh, the towering feeling
Just to know somehow you are near
The overpowering feeling
That any second you may suddenly appear
People stop and stare, they don't bother me
For there's nowhere else on earth that I would rather be
Let the time go by, I won't care if I
Can be here on the street where you live
***************

HALLELUJAH, I LOVE HER SO

Let me tell you about a girl I know
She is my baby and she live next door
Every morning 'fore the sun comes up
She bring my coffee in my favorite cup
That's why I know, yes, I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so
When I'm in trouble and I have no friends
I know she'll go with me until the end
Everybody asks me how I know
I smile at them and say she told me so
That's why I know, oh, I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so
Now if I call her on the telephone
And tell her that I'm all alone
By the time I count from one to four
I hear her on my door
In the evening when the sun goes down
When there is nobody else around
She kisses me and she hold me tight
And tell me "Daddy, everything's all right"
That's why I know, yes, I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so
Now if I call her on the telephone
And tell her that I'm all alone
By the time I count from one to four
I hear her on my door
In the evening when the sun goes down
When there is nobody else around
She kisses me and she hold me tight
And tell me "Daddy, everything's all right"
That's why I know, yes, I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so
Oh, hallelujah
Don't you know I just love her so
She's my little woman waiting across town
Baby, I'm a little fool for you girl

I'M A FOOL TO WANT YOU

I'm a fool to want you
I'm a fool to want you
To want a love that can't be true
A love that's there for others too
I'm a fool to hold you
Such a fool to hold you
To seek a kiss not mine alone
To share a kiss the Devil has known
Time and time again I said I'd leave you
Time and time again I went away
But then would come the time when I would need you
And once again these words I'd have to say
I'm a fool to want you
Pity me, I need you
I know it's wrong, it must be wrong
But right or wrong I can't get along without you
I can't get along without you

VOLARE

Volare, oh oh
Cantare, oh oh oh oh
Let's fly way up to the clouds
Away from the maddening crowds
We can sing in the glow of a star that I know of
Where lovers enjoy peace of mind
Let us leave the confusion and all disillusion behind
Just like birds of a feather, a rainbow together we'll find
Volare, oh oh
E cantare, oh oh oh oh
No wonder my happy heart sings
Your love has given me wings
Penso che un sogno cosi non ritorni mai più
Mi dipingevo le mani e la faccia di blu
Poi d'improvviso venivo dal vento rapito
E incominciavo a volare nel cielo infinito
Volare, oh oh
E cantare, oh oh oh oh
Nel blu, dipinto di blu
Felice di stare lassù
E volavo, volavo felice piu in alto del sole ed ancora piu sù
Mentre il mondo pian piano spariva lontano laggiù
Una musica dolce suonava soltanto per me
Volare, oh oh
E cantare, oh oh oh oh
No wonder my happy heart sings
Your love has given me wings
Nel blu, dipinto di blu
Felice di stare lassù

Let's see that dust fly with that broom
Get all that garbage out of sight

You just put on your coat and hat
And walk yourself to the laundromat
And when you finish doin' that
Bring in the dog and put out the cat
Yakety yak (don't talk back)
Don't you give me no dirty looks
Your father's hip; he knows what cooks
Just tell your hoodlum friend outside

SIXTEEN TONS

Some people say a man is made out of mud
A poor man's made out of muscle and blood
Muscle and blood and skin and bones
A mind that's weak and a back that's strong

You load sixteen tons, what do you get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don't you call me, 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

I was born one morning when the sun didn't shine
I picked up my shovel and I walked to the mine
I loaded sixteen tons of number 9 coal
And the straw boss said, "Well-a bless my soul!"

You load sixteen tons, what do you get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don't you call me, 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

I was born one morning, it was drizzlin' rain
Fightin' and trouble are my middle name
I was raised in the cane brake by an old mama lion
Can't no high-toned woman make me walk the line
You load sixteen tons, what do you get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don't you call me, 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

If you see me comin' better step aside
A lot of men didn't, a lot of men died
One fist of iron, the other of steel
If the right one don't getcha then the left one will

You load sixteen tons, what do you get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don't you call me, 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

STAGGER LEE

The night was clear
And the moon was yellow
And the leaves came tumbling down
I was standing on the corner
When I heard my bulldog bark
He was barking at the two men
Who were gambling in the dark
It was Stagger Lee and Billy
Two men who gambled late
Stagger Lee threw seven
Billy swore that he threw eight
Stagger Lee told Billy
"I can't let you go with that
You have won all my money
And my brand new Stetson hat."
Stagger Lee started off
Goin down that railroad track
He said, I can't get you Billy
But don't be here when I come back
Go on, Stagger Lee
Stagger Lee went home
And he got his .44
Said, "I'm going to the bar room
Just to pay that debt I owe."
Stagger Lee went to the bar room
And he stood across the bar room door
Said, "Now nobody move."
And he pulled his .44
"Stagger Lee," cried Billy
"Oh, please don't take my life
I got three little children
And a very sickly wife."
Stagger Lee shot Billy
Oh he shot that poor boy so bad
Till the bullet came through Billy
And it broke the bartender's glass
Now look out, Stagg, come on

LOUISIANA BLUES

I'm going down in Louisiana
Be, be, behind the sun
I'm going down in Louisiana
Honey, behind the sun
Well, you know I just found out
My troubles just begun
I'm going down in New Orleans, hmm
Get me a mojo hand
I'm going down in New Orleans
Get me a mojo hand
Oh take me with you, man, when you going
I'm on show all you good looking women
Yes, how to treat your love
Let's go back to New Orleans

WALKIN' AFTER MIDNIGHT

I go out walking after midnight
Out in the moonlight just like we used to do
I'm always walking after midnight, searching for you
I walk for miles along the highway
Well, that's just my way of saying, I love you
I'm always walking after midnight, searching for you

I stopped to see a weeping willow
Crying on his pillow
Maybe he's crying for me
And as the skies turn gloomy
Night winds whisper to me
I'm lonesome as I can be

I go out walking after midnight
Out in the starlight
Just hoping you may be somewhere walking
After midnight searching for me

I stopped to see a weeping willow
Crying on his pillow
Maybe he's crying for me
And as the skies turn gloomy
Night winds whisper to me
I'm lonesome as I can be
I'm out walking after midnight, out in the starlight
Just hoping maybe you're somewhere
Walking after midnight, searching for me
***************

CRY ME A RIVER

Now you say you're lonely
Said you cried the whole night through
Well you can cry me a river
Cry me a river
'Cause I cried a river over you
Oohhh
Now you say you're sorry
For being so untrue
So what?
Just cry me a river
Cry me a river
I cried a river over you
You drove me
(Bye-bye, my love)
You nearly drove me out of my head
(Bye-bye, my love)
While you never shed a tear
Remember?
I remember all you said
Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me
And now you say you love me
Well, just to prove you do
Go on and cry me a river
I'd like to see you cry me a river
'Cause I'm tired of crying over
You
***************

MAYBE

Maybe, if I pray every night
You'll come back to me
And maybe, if I cry every day
You'll come back to stay
Oh, maybe
Maybe, if I hold your hand
You will understand
And maybe, if I kissed your lips
I'll be at your command
Oh, maybe
I've cried and prayed to the Lord
To send you back my love
But instead you came to me
But only in my dreams
Maybe if I pray every night
You'll come back to me
And maybe if I cry every day
You'll come back to stay
Oh, maybe
(Maybe, maybe, maybe)
Maybe (Maybe, maybe, maybe)
Maybe (Maybe, maybe, maybe)
Maybe (Maybe, maybe, maybe)
***************

SINCE I DON'T HAVE YOU

I don't have plans and schemes
And I don't have hopes and dreams
I-I-I don't have anything
Since I don't have you
I don't have fond desires
And I don't have happy hours
I-I-I don't have anything
Since I don't have you
I don't have happiness and I guess
I never will again
When you walked out on me
In walked old misery
And he's been here since then
I don't have love to share
And I don't have one who cares
I-I-I don't have anything
Since I don't have
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
(You )

WHO'S SORRY NOW

Who's sorry now
Who's sorry now
Who's heart is aching for breaking each vow
Who's sad and blue
Who's crying too
Just like I cried over you
Right to the end
Just like a friend
I tried to warn you somehow
You had your way
Now you must pay
I'm glad that you're sorry now
Right to the end
Just like a friend
I tried to warn you somehow
You had your way
Now you must pay
I'm glad that you're sorry now

BABY

I've got a man who's always late
Any time we have a date
But I love him
Yes, I love him
I'm gonna walk up to his gate
See if I can get this thing straight
'Cause I want him
And I'm gonna have him
Say is you is, or is you ain't my baby
The way you're acting lately makes me doubt
Youse is still my baby, baby
It seems my flame in your heart's done gone out
A man is a creature
That has always been strange
Just when you're sure of one
You'll find he's gone and made a change
Now, is you is or is you ain't my baby
Maybe baby's found somebody new
Or is my baby still my baby true
Now, is you is or is you ain't my baby
Maybe baby's found somebody new
Or is my baby still my baby true
I guess my baby's found somebody new
And I'd better get right up and go out and find me somebody, too
I said I'm gonna find me somebody, too
