GOOD 4 U

(Ah)

Well, good for you, I guess you moved on really easily
You found a new girl and it only took a couple weeks
Remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world?
(Ah-ah-ah-ah)
And good for you, I guess that you've been workin' on yourself
I guess that therapist I found for you, she really helped
Now you can be a better man for your brand new girl

Well, good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doin' great out there without me, baby
God, I wish that I could do that
I've lost my mind, I've spent the night
Cryin' on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you

Well, good for you, I guess you're gettin' everything you want (Ah)
You bought a new car and your career's really takin' off (Ah)
It's like we never even happened
Baby, what the fuck is up with that? (Ah)
And good for you, it's like you never even met me
Remember when you swore to God I was the only
Person who ever got you? Well, screw that, and screw you
You will never have to hurt the way you know that I do
Well, good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doin' great out there without me, baby
God, I wish that I could do that
I've lost my mind, I've spent the night
Cryin' on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you

(Ah-ah-ah-ah)
(Ah-ah-ah-ah)

Maybe I'm too emotional
But your apathy's like a wound in salt
Maybe I'm too emotional
Or maybe you never cared at all
Maybe I'm too emotional
Your apathy is like a wound in salt
Maybe I'm too emotional
Or maybe you never cared at all
Well, good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doin' great out there without me, baby
Like a damn sociopath
I've lost my mind, I've spent the night
Cryin' on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you

Well, good for you, I guess you moved on really easily

LEVITATING

If you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy
And I can take you for a ride
I had a premonition that we fell into a rhythm

KISS ME MORE

We hug and, yes, we make love
And always just say goodnight (La-la-la-la-la-la)
And we cuddle, sure, I do love it
But I need your lips on mine

We're so young, boy, we ain't got nothin' to lose, uh-oh

We could kiss and just cut the rubbish
Then I might bе onto somethin'
I ain't givin' you one in public
I'm givin' you hundreds, fuck it
Somethin' we just gotta get into
Sign first, middle, last on the wisdom tooth
Niggas wishin' that the pussy was a kissin' booth
Taste breakfast, lunch, and gin and juice
And that dinner just like dessert too
And when we French, refresh, gimme two
When I bite that lip, come get me too
He want lipstick, lip gloss, hickeys too, huh

SAVE YOUR TEARS

Ooh
Na-na, yeah

I saw you dancing in a crowded room (Uh)
You look so happy when I'm not with you
But then you saw me, caught you by surprise
A single teardrop falling from your eye

I don't know why I run away
I make you cry when I run away

You could've asked me why I broke your heart
You could've told me that you fell apart
But you walked past me like I wasn't there
And just pretended like you didn't care

I don't know why I run away
I make you cry when I run away

Take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another
Save your tears for another day
Save your tears for another day (So)

I made you think that I would always stay
I said some things that I should never say
Yeah, I broke your heart like someone did to mine
And now you won't love me for a second time

I don't know why I run away, oh, girl
Said, I make you cry when I run away

Girl, take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another
I realize that I'm much too late
And you deserve someone better

DEJA VU

Car rides to Malibu
Strawberry ice cream, one spoon for two
And tradin' jackets
Laughin’ 'bout how small it looks on you
(Ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha)
Watching reruns of Glee
Bein' annoying, singin’ in harmony
I bet she's braggin' to all her friends, sayin' you're so unique, hmm

So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too?
She thinks it's special, but it's all reused
That was our place, I found it first
I made the jokes you tell to her when she's with you

Do you get déjà vu when she’s with you?
Do you get déjà vu? (Ah) Hmm
Do you get déjà vu, huh?

Do you call her, almost say my name?
’Cause let's be honest, we kinda do sound the same
Another actress
I hate to think that I was just your type
And I bet that she knows Billy Joel
’Cause you played her "Uptown Girl"
You're singin' it together
Now I bet you even tell her how you love her
In between the chorus and the verse (Ooh; I love you)
So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too?
She thinks it's special, but it’s all reused
That was the show we talked about
Played you the songs she's singing now when she's with you

Do you get déjà vu when she's with you?
Do you get déjà vu? (Oh-oh)
Do you get déjà vu?
Strawberry ice cream in Malibu
Don't act like we didn't do that shit, too
You're tradin' jackets like we used to do
(Yeah, everything is all reused)
Play her piano, but she doesn't know (Oh, oh)
That I was the one who taught you Billy Joel (Oh)
A different girl now, but there's nothing new
I know you get déjà vu
I know you get déjà vu
I know you get déjà vu

BEAUTIFUL MISTAKES

It's beautiful, it's bittersweet
You're like a broken home to me
I take a shot of memories
And black out like an empty street
I fill my days with the way you walk
And fill my nights with broken dreams
I make up lies inside my head
Like one day you'll come back to me

Now I'm not holdin' on, not holdin' on
I'm just depressed that you're gone
Not holdin' on, not holdin' on

Beautiful mistakes
I make inside my head, she's naked in my bed
And now we lie awake, makin' beautiful mistakes
I wouldn't take 'еm back, I'm in love with the past
And now we liе awake, makin' beautiful mistakes

Nah-nah-nah, in my head
Nah-nah-nah, in my bed
Nah-nah-nah, eh
Makin' beautiful mistakes
It's pitiful, I can't believe
How every day gets worse for me
I take a break, I cut you off
To keep myself from lookin' soft
I fill my nights with the way you was
And still wake up with broken dreams
I make these lies inside my head
Feel like they're my reality

Now I'm not holdin' on, not holdin' on
I'm just depressed that you're gone
Not holdin' on, not holdin' on

Beautiful mistakes
I make inside my head, she's naked in my bed
And now we lie awake, makin' beautiful mistakes
I wouldn't take 'em back, I'm in love with the past
And now we lie awake, makin' beautiful mistakes

Nah-nah-nah, in my head
Nah-nah-nah, in my bed
Nah-nah-nah, eh
Makin' beautiful mistakes
You did me wrong 'cause I let you (Let you)
Usually, I like my situations beneficial
Doin' something different, got me lookin' stupid (Damn)
The only way I'm comin' back to you is if you're dreaming, lucid (Hmm)
Prove it, if you made a promise then keep it (Keep it)
Why you wanna lie and then get mad? I don't believe it (Boy, bye)
But really, I was doin' just fine without ya
Lookin' fine, sippin' wine, dancin' on club couches (Ah)
Baby, why you wanna lose me like you don't need me? (Don't need me)
Like I don't block you and you still try to reach me (Still try to reach me)
How you figure out how to call me from the TV? (Huh?)
You're runnin' outta chances and this time I mean it (Ah)

Yeah, bet you miss my love, all in your bed (Bed)
Now you're stressin' out, pulling your hair (Hair)
Smelling your pillows and wishin' I was there (I was there)
Slidin' down the shower wall, lookin' sad (Sad)
I know it's hard to let go, I'm the best (I'm the best)
Best you ever had and best you gon' get (Gon' get)
And if we break up, I don't wanna be friends (Be friends)
You're toxic

Beautiful mistakes
I make inside my head, she's naked in my bed
And now we lie awake, makin' beautiful mistakes
I wouldn't take 'em back, I'm in love with the past
And now we lie awake, makin' beautiful mistakes

SUN GOES DOWN

I wanna run away
Don't wanna lie, I don't want a life
Send me a gun and I'll see the sun
I'd rather run away
Don't wanna lie, I don't want a life
Send me a gun and I'll see the sun

You need an instant ease
From your life where you got plenty
Of every hurt and heartbreak
You just take it all to the face
I know that you want to cry
But there's much more to life than dyin'
Over your past mistakes
And people who threw dirt on your name

Since ten, I've been feelin' lonely
Had friends but they was pickin' on me
Always thinkin', "Why my lips so big?
Was I too dark? Can they sense my fears?"
These gay thoughts would always haunt me
I prayed God would take it from me
It's hard for you when you're fightin'
And nobody knows it when you're silent
I'd be by the phone
Stanning Nicki mornin' into dawn
Only place I felt like I belonged
Strangers make you feel so loved, you know?
And I'm happy by the way
That I made that jump, that leap of faith
I'm happy that it all worked out for me
I'ma make my fans so proud of me (Oh)
I wanna run away
Don't wanna lie, I don't want a life
Send me a gun and I'll see the sun
I'd rather run away
Don't wanna lie, I don't want a life
Send me a gun and I'll see the sun

You need an instant ease
From your life where you got plenty
Of every hurt and heartbreak
You just take it all to the face
I know that you want to cry
But there's much more to life than dying
Over your past mistakes
And people who threw dirt on your name

Ha-ah, ha-ah, no-ah

Only bitch I give a conversation to is Siri
My pants Amiri, yes, I'm winnin', clearly
I'm the chosen one, seen my potential, so they fear me
Lately I've been prayin', God, I wonder, can You hear me?
Thinkin' 'bout the old me, I swear I miss you dearly
Stay down 'til you come up, I've been stickin' to that theory
Every day a battle, I'm exhausted and I'm weary
Make sure I smile in public, when alone, my eyes teary
I fought through it all, but that shit hurt me severely
I've been gettin' high to hide behind my insecurities
Takin' different pills, but I know it ain't gon'—
Uh, copped a BMW, new deposit, I picked up another bag
Like fuck it, I'ma count while I'm in it
I hear planes flyin', crowds screamin', money counters, chains clangin'
Shit, I guess that's how it sound when you winnin'
I ain't jokin', do it sound like I'm kiddin'?
I been makin' like two thousand a minute
So high up through the clouds, I was swimmin'
I'm probably gon' drown when I'm in it
I bet she gon' get loud when I'm in it (Uh, uh)
And we might have a child when I'm finished

They say I'm Pac rebirth, never put out a weak verse
Homicides when we lurk, I'ma step 'til my feet hurt
Been puttin' them streets first
White tees turned burgundy t-shirts
Lookin' for somethin' real, he stuck in a deep search
Anxiety killin' me, I just want to leave Earth
When they ask if I'm okay, it just make everything seem worse
Try and explain your feelings, sound like something you rehearsed
Stabbed me in my back with a clean smirk
Lookin' so deep into your eyes, I can read your thoughts, so
Shut the fuck—, I mean, please don't talk
I done been through too much and I don't need another loss
Put that on every war scar for every battle I fought
Uh, copped a BMW, new deposit, I picked up another bag
Like fuck it, I'ma count while I'm in it
I hear planes flyin', crowds screamin', money counters, chains clangin'
Shit, I guess that's how it sound when you winnin'
I ain't jokin', do it sound like I'm kiddin'?
I been makin' like two thousand a minute
So high up through the clouds, I was swimmin'
I'm probably gon' drown when I'm in it
I bet she gon' get loud when I'm in it
And we might have a child when I'm finished

When I'm finished, when I'm finished

HEAT WAVES

(Last night, all I think about is you
Don't stop, baby, you can walk through
Don't want, baby, think about you
You know that I'm never gonna lose)
Road shimmer wigglin' the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a mirror
Road shimmer wigglin' the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a—

Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

Usually I put somethin' on TV
So we never think about you and me
But today I see our reflections clearly
In Hollywood, layin' on the screen
You just need a better life than this
You need somethin' I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now, the night has come, but
Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

You can't fight it, you can't breathe
You say somethin' so lovin', but
Now I gotta let you go
You'll be better off in someone new
I don't wanna be alone
You know it hurts me too
You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I'll say goodbye

Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
I just wonder what you're dreamin' of
When you sleep and smile so comfortable
I just wish that I could give you that
That look that's perfectly un-sad
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Heat waves been fakin' me out

Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

YOUR POWER

Try not to abuse your power
I know we didn't choose to change
You might not wanna lose your power
But havin' it's so strange

She said you were a hero
You played the part
But you ruined her in a year
Don't act like it was hard
And you swear you didn't know (Didn't know)
No wonder why you didn't ask
She was sleepin' in your clothes (In your clothes)
But now she's got to get to class

How dare you?
And how could you?
Will you only feel bad when they find out?
If you could take it all back
Would you?

Try not to abuse your power
I know we didn't choose to change
You might not wanna lose your power
But havin' it's so strange
I thought that I was special
You made me feel
Like it was my fault, you were the devil
Lost your appeal
Does it keep you in control? (In control)
For you to keep her in a cage?
And you swear you didn't know (Didn't know)
You said you thought she was your age

How dare you?
And how could you?
Will you only feel bad if it turns out
That they kill your contract?
Would you?

Try not to abuse your power
I know we didn't choose to change
You might not wanna lose your power
But power isn't pain

Mmm
Ooh
La-la-la-la-la, hmm

HEARTBREAK ANNIVERSARY

Ooh

Balloons are deflated
Guess they look lifeless like me
We miss you on your side of the bed, mmm
Still got your things here
And they stare at me like souvenirs
Don't wanna let you out my head

Just like the day that I met you, the day I thought forever
Said that you love me, but that'll last for never
It's cold outside like when you walked out my life
Why you walk out my life?

I get like this every time
On these days that feel like you and me
Heartbreak anniversary
'Cause I remember every time
On these days that feel like you and me
Heartbreak anniversary, do you ever think of me?

Can't get past the taste of your lips (Taste of your lips)
Don't wanna let you out my head

WITHOUT YOU

You cut out a piece of me and now I bleed internally
Left here without you (No, no, no), without you (Ooh)
And it hurts for me to think about what life could possibly be like
Without you (No, no, no), without you (No, no)

I can't believe that you would up and leave me
Fuck all of your reasons
I lost my shit, you know I didn't mean it
Now I see it, you run and repeat it
And I can't take it back, so in the past is where we'll leave it, huh

So there you go, oh
Can't make a wife out of a ho, oh
I'll never find the words to say I'm sorry
But I'm scared to be alone

You cut out a piece of me and now I bleed internally
Left here without you (No, no, no), without you (Ooh)

BUILD A BITCH

This ain't Build a Bitch (A bitch)

Different ass and bigger boobs
If my eyes are brown or blue
This ain't Build a Bitch (A bitch)
I'm filled with flaws and attitude
So if you need perfect, I'm not built for you (Yeah)

Bob the Builder broke my heart
Told me I need fixing
Said that I'm just nuts and bolts
Lotta parts were missing
Curvy like a cursive font
Virgin and a vixen
That's the kind of girl he wants
But he forgot

This ain't Build a Bitch (A bitch)
You don't get to pick and choose
Different ass and bigger boobs
If my eyes are brown or blue

Boys are always playing dolls
Looking for thеir Barbie
They don't look like Kеn at all
Hardly have a heartbeat
Need someone who falls apart
So he can play Prince Charming
If that's the kind of girl he wants
Then he forgot

WE'RE GOOD

I'm on an island, even when you're close
Can't take the silence, I'd rather be alone

I think it's pretty plain and simple, we gave it all we could
It's time I wave goodbye from the window
Let's end this like we should and say we're good

We're not meant to be like sleeping and cocaine
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself
Let's end it like we should and say we're good

No need to hide it, go get what you want
This won't be a burden if we both don't hold a grudge

I think it's pretty plain and simple, we gave it all we could
It's time I wave goodbye from the window
Let's end this like we should and say we're good

So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself
Let's end it like we should and say we're good
Now you're holding this against me like I knew you would
I'm trying my best to make this easy
So don't give me that look, just say we're good

We're not meant to be like sleeping and cocaine
(Like sleeping and cocaine)
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
(To go our separate ways, oh)
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself
Let's end it like we should and say we're good

You better be

Spiralin' up, just like a rich nigga staircase (Spiral up)
No fly zone, please stay the fuck out my airspace (Out my face)
Niggas say things behind backs that they wouldn't dare say (Dare say)
Know it's on sight when I see you, I'm workin' at Squarespace
Yeah, top of the mornin', I know that you thought I was dormant
Woke up early from shots that were swarmin'
A block full of opps, now the cops in an orbit
Guess somebody got popped, now thеy knockin' on doors
Tryna find an informant but I ain't see Nathan
I'm mindin' my business as God is my witness
No weapon gon' prospеr that’s formin' against me
Nigga, I'm starvin', immensely
Know when I'm done with these songs, you gon' miss me
Ja Morant, I'm on my Grizzly
You niggas just cubs but no, not the ones in the big leagues
After The Fall Off, I promise I'm comin' to sellin' out Wrigley's
Nigga, I'm just a product of poverty, full of narcotics to profit off quickly
My family tree got a history of users that struggle with demons
Not really the hustler instincts
Therefore, often, my pockets was empty
So while some of my partners was servin' up rocks on the corners, the project assemblies
Me, I was startin' to envy, wanna be on the top where it's plenty
Wanna be in the spot like where every bitch want me like Rihanna droppin' new Fenty
What I see in the sky, the 'Ville is the ceilin', can't reach up too high, evidently
Nah, shit, I can't reach up too high, evidently
Never seen no one drivin' a Bentley
I can't be out here moppin' up Wendy's
My life is all I have
My rhymes, my pen, my pad
And I done made it out the struggle, don't judge me
What you sayin' now won't budge me
'Cause where I come from (Come from), so often (So often)
People you grow up with layin' in a coffin
But I done made it through the pain and strife
It's my time now, my world, my life, my life

Say what? The stuff that I've seen got me traumatized
I let the K go when Johnny died
Swangin' that muhfucka' side to side
We don't participate, ain't with that squashin' shit, all we believe in is homicide
I got a good heart, so I send teddy bears every time we make they mommas cry
I pray that my past ain't ahead of me (21)
When I'm in love, I love heavily (On God)
If you betray me, you dead to me (21)
I disrespect you respectfully (Straight up)
I got some partners who left this Earth
Maybe the pain made a better me (On God)
Just know that they secrets is kept with me (On God)
I feel like the streets is in debt with me (Straight up)
I gave my heart away to all the dawg hoes 'cause that's who accepted me (21)
I blame my pops for that shit 'cause if he didn't fail, he could've corrected me (21)
Give all the props to my momma 'cause no matter what, she always protected me (On God)
I promise you, it ain't no checkin' me (On God)
Jump in the water, get wet with me (Straight up, 21, 21)
You want my money or wanna have sex with me?
Can't let the opps or the law get the best of me
I get to answerin', you get to testin' me
I see chicken, you niggas is breast to me
Planted a seed but it ain't a sesame
Can't let you niggas or bitches grow next to me
My life is all I have
My rhymes, my pen, my pad
And I done made it out the struggle, don't judge me
What you sayin' now won't budge me
'Cause where I come from (Come from), so often (So often)
People you grow up with layin' in a coffin
But I done made it through the pain and strife
It's my time now, my world, my life, my life

RUN

When I was a young boy living in the city
All I did was run, run, run, run, run
Staring at the lights, they look so pretty
Momma said "Son, son, son, son, son
You're gonna grow up, you're gonna get old
All that glitters don't turn to gold
But until then just have your fun
Boy, run, run, run, run, run"

Yeah, run, run, run
Run, run, run

When I was a young kid living in the city
All I did was pay, pay, pay, pay, pay
And every single dime that good Lord gave me
I could make it last three, four, five days
Living it up but living down low
Chasing that luck before I get old
And looking back, oh, we had some fun
Boy, run, run, run, run, run

They tell you that the sky might fall
They'll say that you might lose it all
So I run until I hit that wall
Yeah, I learned my lesson, count my blessings
Look to the rising sun and run, run, run
Yeah, one day, well, the sky might fall
Yеah, one day I could lose it all
So I run until I hit that wall
If I learnеd one lesson, count your blessings
Look to the rising sun and run, run, run
Run, run, run

Didn't get everything that I wanted
But I got what I need, yeah yeah
I see that light in the morning
Shining down on me
So take me up high, take me down low
Where it all ends nobody knows
But until then let's have some fun
Yeah, run, run, run, run, run

They tell you that the sky might fall
They'll say that you might lose it all
So I run until I hit that wall
Yeah, I learned my lesson, count my blessings
Look to the rising sun and run, run, run
Yeah, one day well the sky might fall
Yeah, one day I could lose it all
So I run until I hit that wall
If I learned one lesson, count your blessings
Look to the rising sun and run, run, run

Run, run, run
Yeah, run, run, run
Yeah, I learned my lesson, count my blessings
Look to the rising sun
Yeah, I learned my lesson, count my blessings
Look to the rising sun
If I learned one lesson, count your blessings
Look to the rising sun, yeah, run, run, run

ARCADE

A broken heart is all that's left
I'm still fixing all the cracks
Lost a couple of pieces when
I carried it, carried it, carried it home
I'm afraid of all I am
My mind feels like a foreign land
Silence ringing inside my head
Please, carry me, carry me, carry me home

I've spent all of the love I saved
We were always a losing game
Small-town boy in a big arcade
I got addicted to a losing game

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game

How many pennies in the slot?
Giving us up didn't take a lot
I saw the end 'fore it begun
Still I carried, I carried, I carry on
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game

I don't need your games, game over
Get me off this rollercoaster

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game

HIGHER POWER

Sometimes I just can't take it and it isn't alright

You've got me singin' every second, dancin' any hour
Oh yeah, you've got a higher power
You're once in any lifetime
I'm going a million miles an hour

When for so long I'd been down on my knees
Then your love song saved me over and over
For so long I'd been down on my knees
'Til your love song floats me on
Ee-oh, oh-oh

YOUR LOVE

Passin' every red light
I know I'm in over my head
A rebel and I don't hide
Remember all the words that you said

Even if the love was hurtin'
I'll be yours, I'll be yours again
I can feel that fire's burnin'
Give me more

So tell me, would you feel my love?
'Cause I can never get enough
So tell me, would you feel my love?
Yeah, I could never leave, 'cause I need it, that feeling
Let me feel your love

You can make me let go
Forget about the world for a while
You had me at "Hello"
I'm drownin' in the blue of your eyes
Even if the love was hurtin'

I struggle with my inner man (Yeah, yeah)
I hustle, I'll do what I can to get this money
Blaq Tuxedo
Don Dada on the, Don Dada on the beat

Like you, like you
Like you, ooh
I found it hard to find someone like you
Like you, like you
Send your location, come through

I can't sleep no more
In my head, we belong
And I can't be without you
Why can't I find no one like you?
I can't sleep no more

Baby, we tried to fight it
We all been there some days
Thought I needed something else
And acted like I was okay
We just had to work it out
And baby, I needed space
Ain't nobody 'round here on your level
You're so far away
You're pouring your heart out
I'm acting like I knew
You held me so down
So down I never grew, oh
I tried to find out
When none of them came through
And now I'm stuck in the middle
And baby had to pull me out, oh
Like you, like you
Like you, ooh
I found it hard to find someone like you

Send your location, come through (Yeah)

Damn papa, you a rare breed, no comparing
And it's motherfuckin' scary
Tryna keep him 'cause I found him
Let a ho know I ain't motherfuckin' sharing
I could take you to the parents, then to Paris
Plan a motherfuckin' wedding
You the type I wanna marry (Yeah) and keep you merry
I'll put the ring on when you ready
We play our fantasies out in real life ways and
No Final Fantasy, can we end these games though?
You give me energy, make me feel lightweight (Woo)
Like the birds of a feather, baby (Woo)
We real life made for each other (Woo)

TELEPATÍA

Quién lo diría que se podría
Hacer el amor por telepatía
La luna está llena, mi cama vacía
Lo que yo te haría
Si te tuviera de frente, la mente te la volaría
De noche y de día, de noche y de día

You know I'm just a flight away
If you want it, you could take a private plane
A kilómetros estamos conectando
Y me prendes aunque no me estés tocando
You know I got a lot to say
All these voices in the background of my brain
Y me dicen todo lo que estás pensando
Me imagino lo que ya estás maquinando

Quién lo diría que se podría
Hacer el amor por telepatía
La luna está llena, mi cama vacía
Lo que yo te haría
Si te tuviera de frente, la mente te la volaría
De noche y de día, de noche y de día
You know that I can see right through you
I can read your mind, I can read your mind
What you wanna do?
It's written all over your face, times two
'Cause I can read your mind, I can read your mind
I can hear your thoughts like a melody
Listen while you talk when you're fast asleep
You stay on the phone just to hear me breathe
(On repeat)

Quién lo diría que se podría
Hacer el amor por telepatía
La luna está llena, mi cama vacía
Lo que yo te haría

RASPUTIN

There lived a certain man, in Russia long ago
He was big and strong, in his eyes a flaming glow
Most people looked at him with terror and with fear
But to Moscow chicks he was such a lovely dear
He could preach the Bible like a preacher
Full of ecstasy and fire
But he also was the kind of teacher
Women would desire

Ra, Ra, Rasputin
Lover of the Russian Queen
There was a cat that really was gone
Ra, Ra, Rasputin
Russia's greatest love machine
It was a shame how hе carried on

Mi condición: enamorado locamente de una chica que hoy extraño
Y el no tenerte me hace daño
Seríamo' la pareja del año
Cuánto te extraño
Sin condición me enamoré precisamente de una chica que no es mía

Detente, como dice la canción

Sufriendo, llorando de pena
Que no vea mi llanto no vale la pena
Yo no tengo alas, pero tú sí vuelas
Te vuelves la mala de nuestra novela
Me tienes sufriendo, llorando de pena
Que no vea mi llanto no vale la pena
Yo no tengo alas, pero tú sí vuelas
Me quitas la pista y me quedo acapella

Maldita monotonía
¿Fue culpa tuya o fue culpa mía? (Seríamo' la pareja del año)
Yo aprendí a vivir con celos (Con celos)
Tú aprendiste a no ser mía (No, oh)
Solo queda ser sincero
Yo te quiero todavía

LITTLE BIT OF LOVE

I've been holdin' onto pieces, swimmin' in the deep end
Tryna find my way back to you 'cause I'm needin'
A little bit of love
A little bit of love, a little bit of love

Lately I've been countin' stars
And I'm sorry that I broke your heart
It's somethin' that I didn't want for you
But I'm steppin' on broken glass
And I know this is my final chance
All I'm tryna do is find my path to you

I've got voices in my head and there's a deafening silence
I've got voices in my head and I can't lie

I've been holdin' onto pieces, swimmin' in the deep end
Tryna find my way back to you 'cause I'm needin'
A little bit of love
A little bit of love, I need a little love
Just like the air I'm breathin', these open wounds ain't healin'
Tryna find my way back to you 'cause I'm needin'
A little bit of love
A little bit of love, a little bit of love, a little bit of love
Lately, I've been wakin' up
In a dreamy state calling your name
Stayed up too late just thinkin' of you
Now I'm knocking on every door
'Cause I heard you moved from twenty-two
Has it been that long? I guess time just flew

I've got voices in my head and there's a deafening silence
I've got voices in my head and I can't lie

I've been holding onto pieces, swimmin' in the deep end
Tryna find my way back to you 'cause I'm needin'
A little bit of love
A little bit of love, I need a little love
Just like the air I'm breathin', these open wounds ain't healin'
Tryna find my way back to you 'cause I'm needin'
A little bit of love
A little bit of love, a little bit of love, a little bit of love

I tried to fly but I used my wings too soon
Now everything got me thinking of you
I tried a million times to cut you loose
I've been holding onto pieces, swimmin' in the deep end
Tryna find my way back to you 'cause I'm needin'
A little bit of love
A little bit of love, I need a little love
Just like the air I'm breathin', these open wounds ain't healin'
Tryna find my way back to you 'cause I'm needin'
A little bit of love
A little bit of love, a little bit of love, a little bit of love

BLACK HOLE

Now and then
Your name comes up in conversation with my friends
I hate how much I feel it right there in my chest
I hate how much I feel it, yeah
Like, how are you?
It seems like things are going really well for you
I wish that I could say the same about me too
I wish that I could say the same

And boy, you know I've tried to pray
I've bruised my knees
I've tried to bring you back to me
I've tried my best to find some kind of peace
Don't you see?

There's a big black hole where my heart used to be
And I tried my best to fill it up with things I don't need
It don't work like that, no, it's not easy
To fill this gap that you left in me
There's a big black hole where my heart used to be
And I wish that you would realise I'm all that you need
It don't work like that, no, it's not easy
To fill this gap that you left in me
Without a trace
You disappeared and took some of me with you, babe
Like the way I used to laugh until my belly ache
Well, that's all gone away now, yeah

And boy, you know I've tried to pray
I've bruised my knees
I've tried to bring you back to me
I've tried my best to find some kind of peace
Don't you see?

RUNAWAY

(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)

I was listenin' to the ocean
I saw a face in the sand
But when I picked it up
Then it vanished away from my hands (Dah)
I had a dream I was seven
Climbin' my way in a tree
I saw a piece of heaven
Waitin' in patience for me (Dah)

And I was runnin' far away
Would I run off the world someday?
Nobody knows, nobody knows
And I was dancing in the rain
I felt alive and I can't complain

But no, take me home
Take me home where I belong
I can't take it anymore

I was painting a picture
The picture was a painting of you
And for a moment I thought you were here
But then again, it wasn't true (Dah)
And all this time I have been lyin'
Oh, lyin' in secret to myself
I've been putting sorrow on the farthest place on my shelf
La-di-da
And I was runnin' far away
Would I run off the world someday?
Nobody knows, nobody knows
And I was dancing in the rain
I felt alive and I can't complain

But no, take me home
Take me home where I belong
I got no other place to go
No, take me home
Take me home where I belong
I got no other place to go
No, take me home
Take me home where I belong
I can't take it anymore

But I kept runnin' for a soft place to fall
And I kept runnin' for a soft place to fall
And I kept runnin' for a soft place to fall
And I kept runnin' for a soft place to fall

And I was runnin' far away
Would I run off the world someday?
But no, take me home
Take me home where I belong
I got no other place to go
No, take me home
Take me home where I belong
I got no other place to go

No, take me home, home where I belong, no, no
No, take me home, home where I belong, oh, oh, oh
No, take me home, home where I belong, no, no
No, take me home, home where I belong
I can't take it anymore

GOOD WITHOUT

You nearly gave me a heart attack
When you said you're doin' well
Is it obvious you're all I had?
And the last year's been like hell
Guess I'm lonely thinkin' that you ain't moved on
And I'm sorry if I'm comin' off too strong
Never thought I'd see the shape of pain
Standin' in the front porch light
Is it obvious I'm not okay?
Never meant to start a fight
Guess I'm just a moment livin' in your past
But I never thought you'd forget me so fast

'Cause I'm starin' at all these photographs
I guess the good things ain't meant to last
I gave you forever, you gave a month
I've never fallen for anyone
And now I'm looking at the ceilin'
Wonderin' just what you're feelin' now
If that's what love's about
Then I'm so good without

(Ohh-ohh-ohh-ohh-ohh) I'm so good without
(Ohh-ohh-ohh-ohh-ohh) I'm so good without
(Ohh-ohh-ohh-ohh-ohh) I'm so good without
(Ohh-ohh-ohh-ohh-ohh) I'm so good without
I know you probably won't relate
I heard you met somebody new
Don't need no pity for pity's sake
You just do what you gotta do
Is it normal for the pain to grow from fear?
Am I weak for thinkin', "I wish you were here"?

'Cause I'm starin' at all these photographs
I guess the good things ain't meant to last
I gave you forever, you gave a month
I've never fallen for anyone
And now I'm looking at the ceilin'
Wonderin' just what you're feelin' now
If that's what love's about
Then I'm so good without

(Ohh-ohh-ohh-ohh-ohh) I'm so good without
(Ohh-ohh-ohh-ohh-ohh) I'm so good without
(Ohh-ohh-ohh-ohh-ohh) I'm so good without
(Ohh-ohh-ohh-ohh-ohh) I'm so good without
(I'm so good without)

'Cause I'm starin' at all these photographs
I guess the good things ain't meant to last
I gave you forever, you gave a month
I've never fallen for anyone
And now I'm looking at the ceilin'
Wonderin' just what you're feelin' now
If that's what love's about

GIRLS LIKE US

It's hard for girls like us
We don't know who we trust
Not even the ones we love
'Cause they don't know

Stuck here
Stuck here in these waters
So sick to my stomach
Is anybody there?
Red lights
Red lights in the darkness
Everyone's so heartless
Does anybody care?

It's so hard to explain
With your heart in a cage
Only whisper but you wanna shout
'Cause the second you wake
Too much pressure to take
Every part of you wants to cry out

It's hard for girls likе us
We don't know who we trust
Not evеn the ones we love
'Cause they don't know
Try to numb this pain
'Cause we don't wanna get hurt again
Left alone out in the rain
They don't know
Mirror
Mirror on the wall
I don't see beautiful
Staring back at me
Watching
Watching my heart bleed out
Trying not to freak out

It's hard for girls like us
We don't know who we trust
Not even the ones we love
'Cause they don't know
Try to numb this pain
'Cause we don't wanna get hurt again
Left alone out in the rain
They don't know

It's hard for us, for girls like us
Girls like us, they don't know
It's hard for us, for girls like us
Girls like us, they don't know

So ohh
And the worst part is when they smile like this
And it hits me hard, hits me hard
Tryin' to play it cool but inside I'm bruised
And it breaks my heart, breaks my heart
It's hard for all of us
We don't know who we trust
Not even the ones we love
They don't know
Try to numb this pain
'Cause we don't wanna get hurt again
Left alone out in the rain
They don't know

It's hard for us, for girls like us (Girls like us)
Girls like us, they don't know
It's hard for us (Oh no), for girls like us (Girls like us)
Girls like us, they don't know

PARADISE

Mm, mm
Mm, mm-mm-mm

In the fading light, hearts collide
Shadows dance in the distance
Something just ain't right, I'm cold inside
Help me find what I'm missin'

We're all scared to fly, still we try
Learn to be brave, see the other side
Won't you lead me there? Have no fear
Close your eyes, find paradise

Oh, my, my, my
There's a thousand miles between you and I
Oh, my, my, my (My, my, my)
Just a thousand miles between me and paradise
Oh, my, my, my (My, my, my)

Oh, my, my, my
Oh, paradise
Oh, my, my, my
Just a thousand miles between me and paradise

When the dark has gone, the morning's won
We're gonna feel something different
It will set you free, if you just tell me
Every secret, I'll listen

We're all scared to fly, still we try
Learn to be brave, see the other side
Won't you lead me there? Have no fear
Close your eyes, find paradise
Paradise, paradise
Close your eyes, find paradise
Paradise, paradise
Close your eyes, find para-

Oh, my, my, my
There's a thousand miles between you and I
Oh, my, my, my (My, my, my)
Just a thousand miles between me and paradise
Oh, ah, oh, my, my, my

WASTED LOVE

Lo-lo-lo-love
Lo-lo-lo-love
Lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-love

So outspoken, you don't even notice
Every word you say gets right under my skin
Out of focus, but your heart is open
Always trying, but I feel like giving in

Keep breaking hearts to pieces, I
Know I'm beyond the reason I'm
Afraid you're getting over us

Wasted love, don't give up
While you're tryna save us am I trying to not to?
Get wasted, love, wake me up
Oh, tell me I'm dreaming and say this ain't another wasted love

Lo-lo-lo-love

Lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lovе
Wasted love

Takes me to the point I can't control myself
If I knew how to find the words I'd tell you
I admit that sometimes I could use your help

Keep breaking hearts to pieces, I
Know I'm beyond the reason I'm
Afraid you're getting over us

Wasted love, don't give up
While you're tryna save us am I trying to not to?
Get wasted, love, wake me up

COVER ME IN SUNSHINE

I've been dreaming, friendly faces
I've got so much time to kill
Just imagine people laughing
I know some day we will
And even if it's far away
Get me through another day

Cover me in sunshine
Shower me with good times
Tell me that the world's been spinning since the beginning
And everything'll be alright
Cover me in sunshine

From a distance all these mountains
Are just some tiny hills
Wildflowers, they keep living
While they're just standing still
I've been missing yesterday
But what if there's a better place?

Cover me in sunshine
Shower me with good times
Tell me that the world's been spinning since the beginning
And everything'll be alright
Cover me in sunshine
Shower me with good times
Tell me that the world's been spinning since the beginning
And everything'll be alright
Cover me in sunshine
La la la la

Cover me in sunshine
Shower me with good times
Tell me that the world's been spinning since the beginning
