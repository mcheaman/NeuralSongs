I HEARD IT THROUGH THE GRAPEVINE

I bet you're wondering how I knew
'Bout your plans to make me blue
With some other guy you knew before
Between the two of us guys
You know I love you more
It took me by surprise, I must say
When I found out yesterday
Don't you know that

I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh, I heard it through the grapevine
Oh, and I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey, yeah (heard it through the grapevine not much longer would you be my baby)

I know a man ain't supposed to cry
But these tears I can't hold inside
Losing you would end my life you see
Because you mean that much to me
You could have told me yourself
That you love someone else
Instead
I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh, I heard it through the grapevine
And I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey yeah (heard it through the grapevine not much longer would you be my baby)

People say "believe half of what you see
Son and none of what you hear"
But I can't help being confused
If it's true please tell me dear:
Do you plan to let me go
For the other guy you loved before?
Don't you know

I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine, baby
I heard it through the grapevine
I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey, yeah (heard it through the grapevine not much longer would you be my baby)

Honey, Honey, I know (heard it through the grapevine not much longer would you be my baby)
That you're letting me go (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Said I heard it through the grapevine (heard it through the grapevine not much longer would you be my baby)
Oh, heard it thought the grapevine (yeah, yeah, yeah)

HERE COMES THE SUN

Here comes the sun, doo da doo doo
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right

Little darling, it's been a long cold lonely winter
Little darling, it feels like years since it's been here

Here comes the sun, doo da doo doo
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right

Little darling, the smile's returning to the faces
Little darling, it seems like years since it's been here

Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right

Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Little darling, I feel that ice is slowly melting
Little darling, it seems like years since it's been clear

Here comes the sun, doo da doo doo
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right

Here comes the sun, doo da doo doo
Here comes the sun
It's all right
It's all right

I see a red door and I want it painted black
No colours anymore, I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

I see a line of cars and they're all painted black
With flowers and my love, both never to come back
I see people turn their heads and quickly look away
Like a newborn baby, it just happens every day

I look inside myself and see my heart is black
I see my red door, I must have it painted black
Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts
It's not easy facing up when your whole world is black

No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue
I could not foresee this thing happening to you
If I look hard enough into the setting sun
My love will laugh with me before the morning comes

I see a red door and I want it painted black
No colours anymore, I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

I wanna see your face, painted black
Black as night, black as coal
I wanna see the sun blotted out from the sky
I wanna see it painted, painted, painted, painted black
Yeah

30!
Check!

Colder than them grits they fed slaves
Me to rap is like water to raves
AK's with bayonets on deck, rep my set
Sorta like Squidward and his clarinet
I'm in ya bitch mouth but she fantasizing
Staring at the skinnies, said it's so tantalizing
Dog, I'm strategizing, plotting on the throne
Master of the ace, sitting on chrome
Dark nights tryna sleep, stomach on fire
Delusional from hunger so I couldn't get tired
Imagining the equalizer goin' from green to red
Words that rhyme together just appear all in my head
And I'm sorta like Neo with the Matrix code
I try to escape it hoping the drugs'll numb my soul
Say I'm getting old and time's running out
Repeating instrumentals, tryna figure patterns out
I never leave the house, ain't slept in three days
Popping pills, writing, drinking and smoking haze
Weaving kicks and snares, tryna dodge these hooks
Keepin' it original, something that's overlooked
The way a nigga going might go out like Sam Cooke
Or locked up calling home for money on my books
'Cause if this shit don't work, nigga, I failed at life
Turning to these drugs, now these drugs turned my life
And it's the downward spiral, got me suicidal
But too scared to do it so these pills will be the rifle
Surpassing all my idols, took the wrong turn
But can't go back now so let that blunt burn
'Cause now it's my turn if I fuck it all up
It took a while to get here now I depend on these drugs
I took a while to get here now I depend on these drugs
Triple X

STAND BY ME

When the night has come
And the land is dark
And the moon is the only light we'll see
No, I won't be afraid
Oh, I won't be afraid
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

So darlin', darlin', stand by me
Oh, stand by me
Oh, stand
Stand by me, stand by me

If the sky that we look upon
Should tumble and fall
Or the mountains should crumble to the sea
I won't cry, I won't cry
No, I won't shed a tear
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

And darlin', darlin', stand by me
Oh, stand by me
Woah, stand now
Stand by me, stand by me

Darlin', darlin', stand by me
Oh, stand by me
Oh, stand now
Stand by me, stand by me
Whenever you're in trouble won't you stand by me
Oh, stand by me
Woah, just stand now
Oh, stand, stand by me

AIN'T NO MOUNTAIN HIGH ENOUGH

Listen, baby
Ain't no mountain high
Ain't no valley low
Ain't no river wide enough, baby

If you need me, call me
No matter where you are
No matter how far (Don't worry, baby)
Just call my name
I'll be there in a hurry
You don't have to worry
Cause baby there

Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you, babe

Remember the day
I set you free
I told you you could always count on me, darling
From that day on, I made a vow
I'll be there when you want me
Someway, somehow
Oh baby there
Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you, babe

Oh no, darling

No wind, no rain
Nor winter storm
Can't stop me, baby

No, no baby

Cause you are my goal

If you're ever in trouble
I'll be there on the double
Just send for me

Oh, baby!
My love is alive
Way down in my heart
Although we are miles apart

If you ever need a helping hand
I'll be there on the double
Just as fast as I can

Don't you know that there...

Put your head on my shoulder
Hold me in your arms, baby

Show me that you love me too

Put your lips next to mine, dear
Won't you kiss me once, baby
Just a kiss goodnight, maybe
You and I will fall in love
(You and I will fall in love)

People say that love's a game
A game you just can't win
If there's a way
I'll find it someday
And then this fool will rush in

Put your head on my shoulder
Whisper in my ear, baby
Words I want to hear
Tell me, tell me that you love me too
(Tell me that you love me too)
Put your head on my shoulder
Whisper in my ear, baby
Words I want to hear, baby
Put your head on my shoulder

DREAM A LITTLE DREAM OF ME

Stars shining bright above you
Night breezes seem to whisper, I love you
Birds singin' in the sycamore trees
Dream a little dream of me

Say nighty-night and kiss me
Just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me
While I'm alone and blue as can be
Dream a little dream of me

Stars fading but I linger on dear
Still craving your kiss
Now I'm longin' to linger till dawn dear
Just saying this

Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you
Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you
But in your dreams whatever they be
Dream a little dream of me

Stars fading but I linger on dear
Still craving your kiss
I'm longin' to linger till dawn dear
Just saying this
Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you
Leave the worries behind you
But in your dreams, whatever may be
You've gotta make me a promise, promise to me
You'll dream, dream a little dream of me

Just an old, sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind

A SUNDAY KIND OF LOVE

I want a Sunday kind of love
A love to last past Saturday night
And I’d like to know it’s more than love at first sight
And I want a Sunday kind of love, oh yeah yeah

I want a, a love that’s on the square
Can’t seem to find somebody, someone to care
And I’m on a lonely road that leads to nowhere
I need a Sunday kind of love

I do my Sunday dreaming, oh yeah
And all my Sunday scheming
Every minute, every hour, every day
Oh, I’m hoping to discover
A certain kind of lover
Who will show me the way

And my arms need someone, someone to enfold
To keep me warm when Mondays and Tuesdays grow cold
Love for all my life, to have and to hold
Oh and I want a Sunday kind of love
Oh yeah
Yeah, yeah
I don’t want a Monday
Tuesday or Wednesday
Or Thursday, Friday
Or Saturday
Oh, nothing
But Sunday
Oh yeah
I want a Sunday
Sunday
I want a Sunday kind of love
Oh yeah
Sunday, Sunday
Sunday kind of love

FLY ME TO THE MOON

Fly me to the moon
Let me play among the stars
And let me see what spring is like
On a-Jupiter and Mars
In other words, hold my hand
In other words, baby, kiss me

And let me sing forevermore
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words, please be true
In other words, I love you

PUPPY LOVE

And they called it puppy love
Oh I guess they'll never know
How a young heart, how it really feels
And why I love her so
And they called it puppy love
Just because we're seventeen
Tell them all it, please tell them it isn't fair
To take away my only dream
I cry each night
My tears for you
My tears are all in vain
I hope, I hope and I pray
That maybe someday
You'll be back (you'll be back) in my arms (in my arms)
Once again (Will be back in my arms once again)
Someone help me, help me please
Is the answer up above?
How can I, oh how can I tell them?
This is not a puppy love
(This is not a puppy love)
Someone help me, help me please
Is the answer up above?
How can I, oh how can I ever tell them?
This is not a puppy love
(This is not a puppy love)

THIS MAGIC MOMENT

This magic moment
So different and so new
Was like any other
Until I kissed you
And then it happened
It took me by suprise
I knew that you felt it too
By the look in your eyes
Sweeter than wine
Softer than the summer night
Everything I want I have
Whenever I hold you tight
This magic moment
While you lips are close to mine
Will last forever
Forever til the end of time
Oh...
Oh...
Mm...
Sweeter than wine
Softer than the summer night
Everything I want I have
Whenever I hold you tight
This magic moment
While your lips are close to mine
Will last forever
Forever til the end of time
Oh...
Magic moment...
Magic moment...
Magic moment...

EVERYBODY LOVES SOMEBODY

Everybody loves somebody sometime
Everybody falls in love somehow
Something in your kiss just told me
My sometime is now
Everybody finds somebody someplace
Theres no tellin' where love may appear
Something in my heart keeps sayin'
My someplace is here
If I had it in my power
I'd arrange for every girl to have your charm
Then every minute every hour
Every boy would find what I found in your arms
Everybody loves somebody sometime
And although my dream was overdue
Your love made it well worth waiting
For someone like you

NOTHING CAN CHANGE THIS LOVE

If I go, a million miles away
I'd write a letter, each and everyday
Cause honey nothing, nothing can ever change this love I have for you

But honey, nothing, nothing can ever change this love I have for you

But if you wanted, to leave me and roam
When you got back, I'd just say welcome home
Cause honey nothing, nothing, nothing can ever change this, love I have, for you
Wo-oh-oh-oh

Change the love I have for you

COME A LITTLE BIT CLOSER

In a little cafe
Just the other side of the border
She was just sitting there givin' me looks
That made my mouth water
So I started walking her way
She belonged to bad man Jose
And I knew, yes I knew I should leave
When I heard her say, yeah
"Come a little bit closer
You're my kind of man
So big and so strong
Come a little bit closer
I'm all alone and the night is so long"
So we started to dance
In my arms, she felt so inviting
And I just couldn't resist
Just one little kiss, so exciting
Then I heard the guitar player say
"Vamos, Jose's on his way"
Then I knew, yes I knew I should run
But then I heard her say, yeah
"Come a little bit closer
You're my kind of man
So big and so strong
Come a little bit closer
I'm all alone and the night is so long"
Then the music stopped
When I looked the cafe was empty
Then I heard Jose say
"Man, you know you're in trouble plenty"
So I dropped my drink from my hand
And out through the window I ran
And as I rode away
I could hear her say to Jose, yeah
"Come a little bit closer
You're my kind of man
So big and so strong
Come a little bit closer
I'm all alone and the night is so long"
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
Wo oh ho
I still hear her say
I still hear her say

SEPTEMBER IN THE RAIN

The leaves of brown
Came tumblin' down, remember
In September in the rain
The sun went out
Just like a dying ember
That September in the rain
To every word of love
I heard you whisper
The raindrops seemed to play
A sweet refrain
Though spring is here
To me it's still September
That September in the rain
To every word of love
I heard you whisper
The raindrops seemed to play
A sweet refrain
Though spring is here
To me it's still September
That September in the rain
That September in the rain

L is for the way you look at me

TRAVELIN' MAN

I'm a travelin' man
I've made a lot of stops all over the world
And in every part I own the heart
Of at least one lovely girl
I've a pretty señorita waiting for me
Down in old Mexico
If you're ever in Alaska stop and see
My cute little Eskimo
Oh my sweet fraulien down in Berlin town
Makes my heart start to yearn
And my China doll down in old Hong Kong
Waits for my return
Pretty Polynesian baby over the sea
I remember the night
When we walked in the sands of the Waikiki
And I held you oh so tight
------ instrumental break ------
Oh my sweet Fraulien down in Berlin town
Makes my heart start to yearn
And my China doll down in old Hong Kong
Waits for my return
Pretty Polynesian baby over the sea
I remember the night
When we walked in the sands of the Waikiki
And I held you oh so tight
Oh, I'm a travelin' man
Yes, I'm a travelin' man

Baby, ooh, baby
I love to call you baby
Baby, oh oh, baby
I love for you to call me baby
When you squeeze me real tight
You make wrong things right
And I can't stop loving you
And I won't stop calling you
Baby, oh baby
You look so good to me baby
Baby, ooh baby
You are so good to me baby
Just one look in your eye
And my temperature goes sky high
I live for you and can't help it
You know I really don't want to help it
B-A-B-Y, baby
B-A-B-Y, baby
Whenever the sun don't shine
You go out to light my hind
Then I get real close to you
And your sweet kisses see me through
I said, baby, ooh baby
You look so good to me baby
Baby, ooh baby
How I love for you to call me baby
When you squeeze me real tight
You know you make wrong things right
And I can't stop loving you
And I won't stop calling you
B-A-B-Y, baby

A CHANGE IS GONNA COME

I was born by the river
In a little tent
Oh, and just like the river, I've been runnin'
Ever since

It's been a long
A long time comin', but I know
A change gon' come
Oh, yes it will

It's been too hard livin'
But I'm afraid to die
'Cause I don't know what's up there
Beyond the sky

It's been a long
A long time comin', but I know
A change gon' come
Oh, yes it will

I go to the movie
And I go downtown
Somebody keep tellin' me "don't hang around"
It's been a long
A long time comin', but I know
A change gon' come
Oh, yes it will

Then I go to my brother
And I say, "Brother, help me please"
But he winds up
Knockin' me
Back down on my knees
Lor', there been time that I thought
I couldn't last for long
But now I think I'm able to
Carry on

It's been a long
A long time comin', but I know
A change gon' come
Oh, yes it will

YESTERDAY

Yesterday
All my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, I believe in yesterday

Suddenly
I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hanging over me
Oh, yesterday came suddenly

Why she had to go
I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday

Yesterday
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday

Why she had to go
I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday
Yesterday
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday

UM, UM, UM, UM, UM, UM, UM

Walking through the park, it wasn't quite dark
There was a man sitting on a bench
Out of the crowd as his head lowly bowed
He just moaned and he made no sense
He'd just go
Um, um, um, um, um, um
Um, um, um, um, um, um
Um, um, um, um, um, um
Um, um, um, um, um, um
I just couldn't help myself
Yes, I was born with a curious mind
I asked this man just what did he mean
When he moaned if he'd be so kind
And he'd just go
Um, um, um, um, um, um
Um, um, um, um, um, um
Um, um, um, um, um, um
Um, um, um, um, um, um
Now that I've grown up
And the woman I love she has gone
Now that I'm a man, I think I understand
Sometimes everyone must sing this song
Listen to me sing
Um, um, um, um, um, um
Um, um, um, um, um, um
Um, um, um, um, um, um
Um, um, um, um, um, um
Can't you hear me, now

DO YOU BELIEVE IN MAGIC?

Do you believe in magic in a young girl's heart
How the music can free her whenever it starts?
And it's magic if the music is groovy
It makes you feel happy like an old-time movie
I'll tell you about the magic, and it'll free your soul
But it's like tryna tell a stranger 'bout-a rock and roll

If you believe in magic, don't bother to choose
If it's jug band music or rhythm and blues
Just go and listen, and it'll start with a smile
That won't wipe off your face no matter how hard you try
Your feet start tapping, and you can't seem to find
How you got there so just blow your mind


If you believe in magic, come along with me
We'll dance until morning till there's just you and me
And maybe, if the music is right
I'll meet you tomorrow, sort of late at night
And we'll go dancing, baby, then you'll see
How the magic's in the music and the music's in me
Yeah
Do you believe in magic?
Yeah
Believe in the magic of the young girl's soul
Believe in the magic of-a rock and roll
Believe in the magic that can set you free
Ohh, talking 'bout the magic

(Do you believe like I believe?) Do you believe in magic?
(Do you believe like I believe?) Do you believe, believer?
(Do you believe like I believe?) Do you believe in magic?
(Do you believe like I believe?) Do you believe in magic?

And it's signed with love, just like it used to be
The only thing different, the only thing new

I've got the records that we used to share
And they still sound the same as when you were here
The only thing different, the only thing new
I've got the records, she's got you

I've got your memory or has it got me?
I really don't know but I know it won't let me be
I've got your class ring that proved you cared
And it still looks the same as when you gave it dear
The only thing different, the only thing new
I've got these little things, she's got you

I've got your memory or has it got me?

I WISH I KNEW HOW IT WOULD FEEL TO BE FREE

I wish I knew how it would feel to be free
I wish I could break all the chains holding me
I wish I could say all the things that I should say
Say 'em loud, say 'em clear
For the whole round world to hear
I wish I could share all the love that's in my heart
Remove all the bars that keep us apart
I wish you could know what it means to be me
Then you'd see and agree
That every man should be free
I wish I could give all I'm longing to give
I wish I could live like I'm longing to live
I wish I could do all the things that I can do
Though I'm way overdue, I'd be starting anew
Well, I wish I could be like a bird in the sky
How sweet it would be if I found I could fly
Oh, I'd soar to the sun and look down at the sea
And then I'd sing 'cause I'd know, yeah
Then I'd sing 'cause I'd know, yeah
Then I'd sing 'cause I'd know
I'd know how it feels
I'd know how it feels to be free, yeah, yeah
Oh, I'd know how it feels
Yes, I'd know, I'd know how it feels
How it feels to be free, Lord, Lord, Lord, yeah

CAN'T HELP FALLING IN LOVE

For I can't help falling in love with you
For I can't help falling in love with you

AIN'T TOO PROUD TO BEG

I know you wanna leave me
But I refuse to let you go
If I have to beg and plead for your sympathy
I don't mind 'cause you mean that much to me

Ain't too proud to beg, sweet darlin'
Please don't leave me girl, don't you go
Ain't to proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me, girl, don't you go

Now I heard a cryin' man is half a man
With no sense of pride
But if I have to cry to keep you, I don't mind weepin'
If it'll keep you by my side

Ain't too proud to beg, sweet darlin'
Please don't leave me, girl, don't you go
Ain't to proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me, girl, don't you go

If I have to sleep on your doorstep all night and day
Just to keep you from walkin' away
Let your friends laugh, even this I can stand
'Cause I want to keep you any way I can
Ain't too proud to beg, sweet darlin'
Please don't leave me, girl, don't you go
Ain't to proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me, girl, don't you go

Now I've got a love so deep in the pit of my heart
And each day it grows more and more
I'm not ashamed to come and plead to you, baby
If pleadin' keeps you from walkin' out of that door

Ain't too proud to beg, sweet darlin'
Please don't leave (don't leave) me, girl, don't you go
Ain't to proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me, girl, don't you go

PALE BLUE EYES

Sometimes I feel so happy
Sometimes I feel so sad
Sometimes I feel so happy
But mostly, you just make me mad
Baby, you just make me mad

Linger on your pale blue eyes
Linger on your pale blue eyes

Thought of you as my mountain top
Thought of you as my peak
Thought of you as everything
I've had but couldn't keep
I've had but couldn't keep

Linger on your pale blue eyes
Linger on your pale blue eyes

If I could make the world as pure
And strange as what I see
I'd put you in the mirror
I put in front of me
I put in front of me
Linger on your pale blue eyes
Linger on your pale blue eyes


Skip a life completely
Stuff it in a cup
She said, "Money is like us in time
It lies but can't stand up
Down for you is up"

Linger on your pale blue eyes
Linger on your pale blue eyes

It was good what we did yesterday
And I'll do it once again
The fact that you are married
Only proves you're my best friend
But it's truly, truly a sin

Linger on your pale blue eyes
Linger on your pale blue eyes

MR. LONELY

Lonely, I'm Mr. Lonely
I have nobody for my own
I am so lonely, I'm Mr. Lonely
Wish I had someone to call on the phone

Now I'm a soldier, a lonely soldier
Away from home through no wish of my own
That's why I'm lonely, I'm Mr. Lonely
I wish that I could go back home

Letters, never a letter
I get no letters in the mail
I've been forgotten, yes, forgotten
Oh, how I wonder, how is it I failed

Now I'm a soldier, a lonely soldier
Away from home through no wish of my own
That's why I'm lonely, I'm Mr. Lonely

ANOTHER SATURDAY NIGHT

Another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody
I got some money cause I just got paid
How I wish I had someone to talk to
I'm in an awful way

I got in town a month ago, I seen a lotta girls since then
If I could meet 'em I could get 'em but as yet I haven't met 'em
That's why I'm in the shape I'm in

Another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody
I got some money cause I just got paid
How I wish I had someone to talk to
I'm in an awful way

Another fella told me he had a sister who looked just fine
Instead of being my deliverance, she had a strange resemblance
To a cat named Frankenstein

Another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody
I got some money cause I just got paid
How I wish I had someone to talk to
I'm in an awful way
(Here it is another weekend and I ain't got nobody
Man if I was back home I'd be swinging
Two chicks on my arm
Aww yeah
Listen to me huh)

It's hard on a fella, when he don't know his way around
If I don't find me a honey to help me spend my money
I'm gonna have to blow this town

Another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody
I got some money cause I just got paid
How I wish I had someone to talk to
I'm in an awful way

AIN'T THAT A KICK IN THE HEAD

How lucky can one guy be
I kissed her and she kissed me
Like the fella once said
Ain't that a kick in the head?

The room was completely black
I hugged her and she hugged back
Like the sailor said, quote
"Ain't that a hole in the boat"

My head keeps spinning
I go to sleep and keep grinning
If this is just the beginning
My life is gonna be beautiful

I've sunshine enough to spread
It's just like the fella said
Tell me quick ain't love like a kick in the head?

Like the fella once said
Ain't love like a kick in the head?
Like the sailor said, quote
"Ain't that a hole in the boat?"

My head keeps spinning
I go to sleep and keep grinning
If this is just the beginning
My life is gonna be beautiful

She's telling me we'll be wed
She's picked out a king size bed
I couldn't feel any better or I'd be sick
Tell me quick, oh, ain't love a kick?
Tell me quick, ain't love a kick in the head?

MONSTER MASH

I was working in the lab late one night
When my eyes beheld an eerie sight
For my monster from his slab began to rise
And suddenly to my surprise

He did the mash
He did the monster mash
The monster mash
It was a graveyard smash
He did the mash
It caught on in a flash
He did the mash
He did the monster mash

From my laboratory in the castle east
To the master bedroom where the vampires feast
The ghouls all came from their humble abodes
To get a jolt from my electrodes

They did the mash
They did the monster mash
The monster mash
It was a graveyard smash
They did the mash
It caught on in a flash
They did the mash
They did the monster mash
The zombies were having fun
The party had just begun
The guests included Wolf Man
Dracula and his son

The scene was rockin', all were digging the sounds
Igor on chains, backed by his baying hounds
And I, Zombina was about to arrive
With my vocal group, "The Skeletones"

They played the mash
They played the monster mash
The monster mash
It was a graveyard smash
They played the mash
It caught on in a flash
They played the mash
They played the monster mash

Out from his coffin, Drac's voice did ring
Seems he was troubled by just one thing
He opened the lid and shook his fist
And said, "Whatever happened to my Transylvania twist?"
It's now the mash
It's now the monster mash
The monster mash
And it's a graveyard smash
It's now the mash
It's caught on in a flash
It's now the mash
It's now the monster mash

Now everything's cool, Drac's a part of the band
And my monster mash is the hit of the land
For you, the living, this mash was meant too
When you get to my door, tell them Zombina sent you

Then you can mash
Then you can monster mash
The monster mash
And do my graveyard smash
Then you can mash
You'll catch on in a flash
Then you can mash
Then you can monster mash

TRY A LITTLE TENDERNESS

Oh, she may be weary
And young girls they do get weary
Wearing that same old shaggy dress, yeah yeah
But when she gets weary
Try a little tenderness, yeah yeah
(Oh my, not)

You know she's waiting
Just anticipating
For things that she'll never, never, never, never
Possess, yeah yeah
But while she's there waiting, and without them
Try a little tenderness (That's all you gotta do)

It's not just sentimental, no, no, no
She has her grief and care, yeah yeah yeah
But the soft words, they are spoke so gentle, yeah
It makes it easier, easier to bear, yeah

You won't regret it, no, no
Some girls they don't forget it
Love is their own happiness, yeah
But it's all so easy
All you gotta do is try, try a little tenderness, yeah
All you gotta do is, man, hold her where you want her
Squeeze her, don't tease her, never leave her
Get to her, try, try
Just try a little tenderness, ooh yeah yeah yeah
You got to know how to love her, man, you'll be surprised, man
You've got to squeeze her, don't tease her, never leave
You've got to hold her and rub her softly
Try a little tenderness, ooh yeah yeah yeah
You've got to rub her gentle man, all you gotta do
Don't got, don't bruise her, no no
You've got to love her, tease her, don't squeeze her
Gotta try nah nah nah, try

You got to love, squeeze, don't tease my baby
Love her, no

YOU'RE ALL I NEED TO GET BY

Like sweet morning dew
I took one look at you
And it was plain to see
You were my destiny

With my arms open wide
I threw away my pride
I'll sacrifice for you
Dedicate my life to you
I will go where you lead
Always there in time of need

And when I lose my will
You'll be there to push me up the hill

There's no, no looking back for us
We got love sure 'nough, that's enough
You're all, You're all I need to get by

Like an eagle protects his nest, for you I'll do my best
Stand by you like a tree, dare anybody to try and move me
Darling in you I found
Strength where I was torn down
Don't know what's in store but together we can open any door
Just to do what's good for you and inspire you a little higher

I know you can make a man out of a soul that didn't have a goal

Cause we, we got the right foundation and with love and determination
You're all, you're all I want to strive for and do a little more
You're all the joys under the sun wrapped up into one
You're all I need, you're all I need, you're all I need to get by

Many guys have come to you
With a line that wasn't true
And you passed them by
Now you're in the center ring
And their lines don't mean a thing
Why don't you let me try
Now I don't wear a diamond ring
I don't even know a song to sing
All I know is

La la la la la la la la la means
I love you
Oh, baby please now
La la la la la la la la la means
I love you

If I ever saw a girl
That I needed in this world
You are the one for me, (one for me)
Let me hold me in my arms
Girl, and thrill you with my charms

The things I am sayin' are true
And the way I explain them to you
Listen to me

SWEET CAROLINE

Where it began
I can't begin to know when
But then I know it's growing strong
Was in the spring
And spring became the summer
Who'd have believed you'd come along

Hands, touchin' hands
Reachin' out, touchin' me, touchin' you

Sweet Caroline
Good times never seemed so good
I've been inclined
To believe they never would

But now I look at the night
And it don't seem so lonely
We fill it up with only two
And when I hurt
Hurtin' runs off my shoulders
How can I hurt when holdin' you
Warm, touchin' warm
Reachin' out, touchin' me, touchin' you

Sweet Caroline
Good times never seemed so good
I've been inclined
To believe they never would
Oh no no

Sweet Caroline
Good times never seemed so good
Sweet Caroline
I believe they never could
Sweet Caroline
Good times never seemed so good

THESE DAYS

I've been out walking
I don't do too much talking these days
These days
These days I seem to think a lot
About the things that I forgot to do
And all the times I had
The chance to

I stopped my rambling
I don't do too much gambling these days
These days
These days I seem to think about
How all the changes came about my ways
And I wonder if I'd see another
Highway

I had a lover
I don't think I risk another these days
These days
And if I seem to be afraid
To live the life that I have made in song
It's just that I've been losing
So long
La-la-la-la-la
La-la
I'd stopped my dreaming
I won't do too much scheming these days
These days
These days I sit on cornerstones
And count the time in quarter tones to 10
Please don't confront me with my failures
I had not forgotten them

RAMBLIN' GAMBLIN' MAN

Yeah, I'm gonna tell my tale come on, uh come on, give a listen

'Cause I was born lonely down by the riverside
Learned to spin fortune wheels and throw dice
I was just thirteen when I had to leave home
Knew I couldn't stick around, I had to roam

Ain't good lookin', but you know I ain't shy
Ain't afraid to look you girl, hey, in the eye
So if you need some lovin', and you need it right away
Take a little time out, and maybe I'll stay

But I got to ramble (Ramblin' man)
Gamble (Gamblin' man)
Got to, got to ramble (ramblin' man)
I was born a ramblin', gamblin' man
Yeah, uhh, say, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, hah, hah
A bring it on, come on now
Yeah, alright, here we go now

Now, I'm out of money, 'cause you know I need some
Ain't gonna run on lovin', and I must run
Got to keep movin', never gonna slow down

Cause I got to ramble (Ramblin' man)
I got to gamble (gamblin' man)

WHAT THE WORLD NEEDS NOW IS LOVE

Yo mom, who thought that this could happen

Nobody but me

Love is what we need
So if you get that, the blessing will proceed, so please give back

Coming at ya, mob deep on this song
And now it's on
Come together for born
Better yet form Voltron
Spread love like mustard, bust it, making knowledge be born
So trust it, it's B-D-K, learn to love it
(Chorus)
What the world needs now is love sweet love

I know just exactly what world needs now, plead it
Everybody come show a little love for your family, Jesus we need it   And
Even when I flip through the pages of my history
Slowly reveal the mystery
Got to get it together quickly, in this industry
Lord, we don't need another mountain
There are mountains and hillsides enough to climb
There are oceans and rivers enough to cross
Enough to last till the end of time

Yo, yo, yo
I could see far and beyond, me and my auntie Dionne
With the homie Fazon, who's cool as freon
As the music plays on, portrays and stays on
Got this thing together, got to get our game together
Life is life and if your ears are open
You could see when you scope doors closed or open
Whether you're in or you're out
You're always in and that's for sure
And that's what friends are for, for what the world needs
 (Chorus)
What the world needs now is love sweet love
What the world needs now

Lord, we don't need another meadow
There are cornfields and wheat fields enough to grow
There are sunbeams and monnbeams enough to shine
Listen Lord, if you want to know
Give me this drug, they call it love
I'd pump it off around the world
To touch the soul of every man, woman, child, boy and girl

I pray that we could live together on this family tree
Royal Flush and Mic G, we want the world to see

What's happening
Is the matter when the people traveling
To grasp a pen and pad and then this united gathering
Keep it on the love, love if you expect the vibe
Work it out just like an exercise, shame of
 (Chorus)
What the world needs now is love, sweet love
What the world needs no
Come on can we have unity
Just a little bit of unity, brother
Just a little bit, just a little bit of love baby

L is for the lies that they told and the lines that they crossed
When they burglarized my soul, they cold
O is for the outsiders looking in, times is looking grim
You can't even trust your friends, damn
V, cause it's very necessary
That various policies get variated and eradicated, I hate it
E is for the extra mile you had to walk
Just to talk to your homie who was locing
And to show him you have love for him
What the world needs now is love sweet love
What the world needs now
It's the only thing that there's just too little of

We humbly gather together united with almighty power
Ready to rumble at any hour
Got love and it won't let me stumble, follow me

What the world needs now is love sweet love
What the world needs now
 (Fades out)
Can we get together, I'm on my way, baby
Come on get together, unity
We can unify the hip-hop nation

THE END OF THE WORLD

Why does the sun go on shining?
Why does the sea rush to shore?
Don't they know it's the end of the world?
'Cause you don't love me any more

Why do the birds go on singing?
Why do the stars glow above?
Don't they know it's the end of the world?
It ended when I lost your love

I wake up in the morning and I wonder
Why everything's the same as it was
I can't understand, no, I can't understand
How life goes on the way it does

Why does my heart go on beating?
Why do these eyes of mine cry?
Don't they know it's the end of the world?
It ended when you said goodbye

Why does my heart go on beating?
Why do these eyes of mine cry?
Don't they know it's the end of the world?
It ended when you said goodbye

I WANT YOU BACK

Uh-huh huh huh huh
Let me tell ya now
Uh-huh

When I had you to myself, I didn't want you around
Those pretty faces always made you stand out in a crowd
But someone picked you from the bunch, one glance was all it took
Now it's much too late for me to take a second look

Oh, baby, give me one more chance (To show you that I love you)
Won't you please let me (Back in your heart)
Oh, darlin', I was blind to let you go (Let you go, baby)
But now since I see you in his arms (I want you back)

Yes, I do now (I want you back)
Ooh, ooh, baby (I want you back)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (I want you back)
Na, na, na, na

Tryin' to live without your love is one long sleepless night
Let me show you, girl, that I know wrong from right
Every street you walk on I leave tear stains on the ground
Following the girl, I didn't even want around
Let me tell you now
Oh, baby, all I need is one more chance (To show you that I love you)
Won't you please let me (Back in your heart)
Oh, darlin', I was blind to let you go (Let you go, baby)
But now since I see you in his arms, uh-huh

A buh buh buh buh
A buh buh buh buh, all I want
A buh buh buh buh, all I need
A buh buh buh buh, all I want
A buh buh buh buh, all I need

Oh, just one more chance
To show you that I love you
Baby! Baby!
Baby! Baby!
Baby! Baby!
I want you back

Forget what happened then
I want you back

Let me live again
Oh baby, I was blind to let you go
But now since I see you in his arms
I want you back

Spare me of this cause

Gimme back what I lost

TWISTIN' THE NIGHT AWAY

Let me tell you about a place
Somewhere up a New York way
Where the people are so gay
Twisting the night away
Here they have a lot of fun
Putting trouble on the run
Man, you find the old and young
Twisting the night away
They're twisting, twisting
Everybody's feeling great
They're twisting, twisting
They're twisting the night away
Here's a man in evening clothes
How he got here, I don't know, but
Man, you oughta see him go
Twisting the night away
He's dancing with a chick in slacks
She's moving up and back
Oh, man, there ain't nothing like
Twisting the night away
They're twisting, twisting
Everybody's feeling great
They're twisting, twisting
They're twisting the night
Let's twist a while
Lean up
Lean back
Lean up
Lean back
Watusi
Now fly
Now twist
They're twisting the night away
Here's a fella in blue jeans
Dancing with an older queen
Who's dolled up in her diamond rings and
Twisting the night away
Man, you oughta see her go
Twisting to the rock and roll
Here you find the young and old
Twisting the night away
They're twisting, twisting, man
Everybody's feeling great
They're twisting, twisting
They're twisting the night
One more time
Lean up
Lean back
Lean up
Lean back
Watusi
Now fly
Now twist

PEOPLE GET READY

People get ready, there's a train a-comin'
You don't need no baggage, you just get on board
All you need is faith to hear the diesels hummin'
Don't need no ticket, you just thank the Lord

So, people get ready for the train to Jordan
Picking up passengers coast to coast
Faith is the key, open the doors and board 'em
There's hope for all among those loved the most
There ain't no room for the hopeless sinner
Who would hurt all mankind just to save his own, believe me now
Have pity on those whose chances grow thinner
For there's no hiding place against the kingdom's throne

So, people get ready, there's a train a-comin'
You don't need no baggage, you just get on board
All you need is faith to hear the diesels hummin'
Don't need no ticket, you just thank the Lord

'Cause one is the loneliest number that you'll ever do

MY CHERIE AMOUR

La la la la la la
La la la la la la

My cherie amour, lovely as a summer day
My cherie amour, distant as the milky way
My cherie amour, pretty little one that I adore
You're the only girl my heart beats for
How I wish that you were mine
In a cafe or sometimes on a crowded street
I've been near you, but you never noticed me
My cherie amour, won't you tell me how could you ignore
That behind that little smile I wore
How I wish that you were mine

La la la la la la
La la la la la la

Maybe someday, you'll see my face among the crowd
Maybe someday, I'll share your little distant cloud
Oh, cherie amour, pretty little one that I adore
You're the only girl my heart beats for
How I wish that you were mine
La la la la la la

SPOOKY

In the cool of the evening
When everything is gettin' kind of groovy
You call me up and ask me
Would I like to go with you and see a movie
First I say no, I've got some plans for the night
And then I stop
And say "all right"
Love is kinda crazy with a spooky little boy like you

You always keep me guessin'
I never seem to know what you are thinking
And if a girl looks at you
It's for sure your little eye will be a-winkin'
I get confused, I never know where I stand
And then you smile
And hold my hand
Love is kinda crazy with a spooky little boy like you
Spooky

If you decide someday to stop this little game that you are playing
I'm gonna tell you all the things my heart's been a-dyin' to be saying
Just like a ghost you've been a-hauntin' my dreams
But now I know
You're not what you seem
Love is kinda crazy with a spooky little boy like you
Spooky, spooky, oh whoa, all right
Spooky, oh yea yea
I said Spooky yea yea
***************

THEN HE KISSED ME

Well he walked up to me
And he asked me if I wanted to dance
He looked kind of nice
And so I said I might take a chance
When he danced he held me tight
And when he walked me home that night
All the stars were shining bright
And then he kissed me
Each time I saw him
I couldn't wait to see him again
I wanted to let him know
That he was more than a friend
I didn't know just what to do
So I whispered "I love you"
And he said that he loved me too
And then he kissed me
He kissed me in a way that I've never been kissed before
Kissed me In a way that I want to be kissed forever more
I knew that he was mine
So I gave him all the love that I had
And one day he took me home
To meet his Mom and his Dad
Then he asked me to be his bride
And always be right by his side
I felt so happy I almost cried
And then he kissed me
Then he asked me to be his bride
And always be right by his side
I felt so happy I almost cried
And then he kissed me
And then he kissed me
And then he kissed me
***************

WOULDN'T IT BE NICE

Wouldn't it be nice if we were older?
Then we wouldn't have to wait so long
And wouldn't it be nice to live together
In the kind of world where we belong?
You know it's gonna make it that much better
When we can say goodnight and stay together

Wouldn't it be nice if we could wake up
In the morning when the day is new?
After having spent the day together
Hold each other close the whole night through

But happy times together we've been spending
I wish that every kiss was never-ending
Oh, wouldn't it be nice?

Maybe if we think and wish and hope and pray, it might come true
Oh, baby, then there wouldn't be a single thing we couldn't do
Oh, we could be married (Oh, we could be married)
And then we'd be happy (And then we'd be happy)
Oh, wouldn't it be nice?
You know it seems the more we talk about it
It only makes it worse to live without it
But let's talk about it
But wouldn't it be nice?

Goodnight, my baby
Sleep tight, my baby
Goodnight, my baby
Sleep tight, my baby
Goodnight, my baby
Sleep tight, my baby
***************

I SECOND THAT EMOTION

Maybe you want to give me kisses sweet
But only for one night with no repeat
And maybe you'd go away and never call
And a taste of honey is worse than none at all

Oh, little girl, in that case I don't want no part
That would only break my heart
Oh, but if you feel like loving me
If you got the notion
I second that emotion
Said, if you feel like giving me
A lifetime of devotion
I second that emotion

Maybe you think that love would tie you down
And you don't have the time to hang around
Maybe you think that love was made for fools
So it makes you wise to break the rules

Oh, little girl, in that case I don't want no part
That would only break my heart
Oh, but if you feel like loving me
If you got the notion
I second that emotion
Said, if you feel like giving me
A lifetime of devotion
I second that emotion
Oh, little girl, in that case I don't want no part
That would only break my heart
Oh, but if you feel like loving me
If you got the notion
I second that emotion
Said, if you feel like giving me
A lifetime of devotion

GOING UP THE COUNTRY

I'm goin' up the country, baby, don't you wanna go?
I'm goin' up the country, baby, don't you wanna go?
I'm goin' to someplace where I've never been before

I'm goin', I'm goin' where the water tastes like wine
I'm goin' where the water tastes like wine
We can jump in the water, stay drunk all the time


I'm gonna leave the city, got to get away
I'm gonna leave the city, got to get away
All this fussin' and fightin', man, you know I sure can't stay

Now, baby, pack your leavin' trunk, you know we've got to leave today
Just exactly where we're goin' I cannot say, but
We might even leave the USA
'Cause there's a brand new game and I don't wanna play


No use for you runnin' or screamin' and cryin'
'Cause you've got a home as long as I've got mine

UP ON THE ROOF

(Up on the roof)
(Up on the roof)

When this old world starts getting me down
And people are just too much for me to face (Up on the roof)
I climb way up to the top of the stairs
And all my cares just drift right into space (Up on the roof)
On the roof, it's peaceful as can be
And there, the world below can't bother me
Let me tell you now

When I come home feeling tired and beat
I go up where the air is fresh and sweet (Up on the roof)
I get away from the hustlin' crowds
And all that rat race noise down in the street (Up on the roof)
On the roof's the only place I know
Where you just have to wish to make it so
Let's go up on the roof (Up on the roof)


At night, the stars put on a show for free
And, darling, you can share it all with me
I keep-a tellin' you-a
Right smack dab in the middle of town
I found a paradise that's trouble-proof (Up on the roof)
And if this world starts getting you down
There's room enough for two up on the roof (Up on the roof)
Up on the roof (Up on the roof)
Oh, come on, baby (Up on the roof)
Oh, come on, honey (Up on the roof)
Everything is all right (Up on the roof)

I LEFT MY HEART IN SAN FRANCISCO

The loveliness of Paris seems somehow sadly gay
The glory that was Rome is of another day
I've been terribly alone and forgotten in Manhattan
I'm going home to my city by the Bay
I left my heart in San Francisco
High on a hill, it calls to me
To be where little cable cars climb halfway to the stars
The morning fog may chill the air, I don't care
My love waits there in San Francisco
Above the blue and windy sea
When I come home to you, San Francisco
Your golden sun will shine for me

I CAN'T HELP MYSELF

I always thought I could
Fall from a height
Land on my feet
Now I'm considering
Throwing in the towel
Admitting defeat
Just like the Four Tops
I can't help myself
I can't help myself
I can't help myself
I can't help myself
Nothing worth finding
Is easily found
Try as one might
That was supposed to sound
Very profound
It probably sounds dry
Just like the Four Tops
I can't help myself
I can't help myself
I can't help myself
I can't help myself
Myself myself myself
Just like the Four Tops
I can't help myself
I can't help myself
I can't help myself
I can't help myself
I can't help myself
I can't help myself
I felt I had to tell the world
About you
I felt I had to tell the world
About you
Yes I felt I had to tell the world
Tell the world
Tell the world

Tell the world
Tell the world
Tell the world about you, baby
I can't help myself

REMEMBER

Seems like the other day
My baby went away
He went away 'cross the sea
It's been two years or so
Since I saw my baby go
And then this letter came for me
It said that we were through
He found somebody new
Oh, let me think, let me think, what can I do?

Oh no
Oh no
Oh no no no no no

(Remember) walkin' in the sand
(Remember) walkin' hand in hand
(Remember) the night was so exciting
(Remember) smile was so inviting
(Remember) then he touched my cheek
(Remember) with his fingertips
Softly, softly we'd meet with our lips

Whatever happened to
The boy that I once knew?
The boy who said he'd be true
Oh, what will happen to
The life I gave to you?
What will I do with it now?
(Remember) walkin' in the sand
(Remember) walkin' hand in hand
(Remember) the night was so exciting
(Remember) smile was so inviting

Makes no difference what group I'm in

I am everyday people, yeah, yeah

For living with a fat one, trying to be a skinny one
And different strokes for different folks

Lately things, they don't seem the same
Acting funny, but I don't know why
'Scuse me while I kiss the sky

Am I happy or in misery?

Help me! Help me!

Senora, she's a sensation
The reason for aviation
And fellas, you got to watch it
When she wind up, she bottom, she go like a rocket
(Jump in the line, rock your body in time) OK, I believe you!
(Jump in the line, rock your body in time) Hoist those skirts a little higher!
(Jump in the line, rock your body in time) Up the chimney!
(Jump in the line, rock your body in time) Whooooa!
Shake, shake, shake, Senora
Shake your body line
Work, work, work, Senora
Work it all the time
Dance, dance, dance, Senora
Dance it all the time
Work, work, work, Senora
Work it all the time
Senora dances Calypso
Left to right is the tempo
And when she gets the sensation
She go up in the air, come down in slow motion
(Jump in the line, rock your body in time) OK, I believe you!
(Jump in the line, rock your body in time) Somebody, help me!
(Jump in the line, rock your body in time) OK, I believe you!
(Jump in the line, rock your body in time) Whooooa!
Shake, shake, shake, Senora, shake your body line
Shake, shake, shake, Senora, shake it all the time
Work, work, work, Senora!

Shit, tired of gettin' shot at
Tired of gettin' chased by the police and arrested
Niggas need a spot where we can kick it
A spot where we belong, that's just for us
Niggas ain't gotta get all dressed up and be Hollywood
Y'knahmean? Where do niggas go when we die?
Ain't no heaven for a thug nigga
That's why we go to thug mansion
That's the only place where thugs get in free
And you gotta be a G, at thug mansion

A place to spend my quiet nights, time to unwind
So much pressure in this life of mine, I cry at times
I once contemplated suicide, and woulda tried
But when I held that 9, all I could see was my mama's eyes
No one knows my struggle, they only see the trouble
Not knowin' it's hard to carry on when no one loves you
Picture me inside the misery of poverty
No man alive has ever witnessed struggles I survived
Prayin' hard for better days, promise to hold on
Me and my dawgs ain't have a choice but to roll on
We found a finally spot to kick it
Where we can drink liquor and no one bickers over trick shit
A spot where we can smoke in peace, and even though we G's
We still visualize places that we can roll in peace
And in my mind's eye, I see this place the players go and pass it
I got a spot for us all, so we can ball, at thug's mansion
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Chillin' with homies and family
Sky high, iced out, paradise in the sky
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me
Chromed-out, mansion in paradise, in the sky

Will I survive all the fights and the darkness?
Trouble sparks, they tell me: "Home is where the heart is."
Dear departed, I shed tattooed tears
And couldn't sleep good for multiple years
Witness peers catch gunshots; nobody cares
Seen the politicians ban us, they'd rather see us locked in chains
Please explain why they can't stand us
Is there a way for me to change?
Or am I just a victim of things I did to maintain?
I need a place to rest my head
With the little bit of homeboys that remains
‘Cause all the rest dead; is there a spot for us to grow?
If you find it, I'll be right behind ya, show me and I'll go
How can I be peaceful? I'm comin' from the bottom
Watch my daddy scream "Peace!" while the other man shot him
I need a house that's full of love, when I need to escape
The deadly places slingin' drugs, in thug's mansion
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Chillin' with homies and family
Sky high, iced out, paradise in the sky
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me
Chromed-out, mansion in paradise, in the sky

Dear Mama, don't cry, your baby boy's doin' good
Tell the homies I'm in Heaven and they ain't got hoods
Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night, it had me shook
Drinkin' peppermint Schnapps, with Jackie Wilson and Sam Cooke
Then some lady named Billie Holiday sang
Sittin' there kickin' it with Malcolm 'til the day came
Little Latasha sho' grown
Tell the lady in the liquor store that she's forgiven, so come home
Maybe in time you'll understand
Only God can save us, when Miles Davis cuttin' lose with the band
Just think of all the people that you knew in the past
That passed on, they in Heaven, found peace at last
Picture a place that they exist, together
There has to be a place better than this, in Heaven
So right before I sleep, dear God, what I'm askin'
Remember this face, save me a place in thug's mansion
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Chillin' with homies and family
Sky high, iced out, paradise in the sky (In thugs mansion)
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me
Chromed-out, mansion in paradise, in the sky (Thugs mansion)
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Chillin' with homies and family
Sky high, iced out, paradise, in the sky (In thugs mansion)
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me
Chromed-out, mansion in paradise, in the sky

BABY I NEED YOUR LOVING

Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
Baby, I need your loving.  (I really need you.)
Baby, I need your loving.  (I really need you.)
Although you're never near, (I really need you.)
Your voice I often hear.  (I really need you.)
Another day, another night, (I really need you.)
I long to hold you tight, (I really need you.)
'Cause I'm so lonely
Baby, I need your loving
Got to have all your loving
Baby, I need your loving
Got to have all your loving
Some say it's a sign of weakness for a man to beg
Than weak, I'd rather be
If it means having you to keep
'Cause lately I've been losing sleep
Baby, I need your loving
Got to have all your loving
Baby, I need your loving
Got to have all your loving
Empty nights echo your name
(Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh.)
Whoa, sometimes I wonder
(Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh.)
Will I ever be the same
(Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh.)
Oh yeah
(Baby, baby,) When you see me smiling, you know
(I need you and I want you, baby.)
Things have gotten worse.  (And I need you and I love you, baby.)
Any smile you might see (And I need you and I want you, baby.)
Has all been rehearsed.  (And I need you and I love you, baby.)
Darling, I can't go on with you.  (And I need you and I want you, baby.)
This emptiness won't let me live without you
(And I need you and I love you, baby.)
This loneliness inside me, darling, (And I need you and I want you, baby.)
Makes me feel half alive.  (And I need you and I...)
Baby, I need your loving
Got to have all your loving
Baby, I need your loving
Got to have all your loving
Baby, I need your loving
Got to have all your loving
