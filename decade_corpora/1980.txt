UNDER PRESSURE

Mmm num ba de
Dum bum ba be
Doo buh dum ba beh beh

Pressure pushing down on me
Pressing down on you, no man ask for
Under pressure that burns a building down
Splits a family in two
Puts people on streets
Um ba ba be
Um ba ba be
De day da
Ee day da- that's okay

It's the terror of knowing what this world is about
Watching some good friends screaming, "Let me out!"
Pray tomorrow gets me higher
Pressure on people, people on streets

Day day de mm hm
Da da da ba ba
Okay
Chipping around, kick my brains around the floor
These are the days it never rains but it pours
Ee do ba be
Ee da ba ba ba
Um bo bo
Be lap
People on streets
Ee da de da de
People on streets
Ee da de da de da de da
It's the terror of knowing what this world is about
Watching some good friends screaming, 'Let me out'
Pray tomorrow gets me higher, high
Pressure on people, people on streets

Turned away from it all like a blind man
Sat on a fence but it don't work
Keep coming up with love but it's so slashed and torn
Why, why, why?
Love, love, love, love, love
Insanity laughs under pressure we're breaking

Can't we give ourselves one more chance?
Why can't we give love that one more chance?
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love
Give love, give love, give love, give love, give love?

Because love's such an old-fashioned word
And love dares you to care for
The people on the (People on streets) edge of the night
And love (People on streets) dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance
This is ourselves under pressure
Under pressure
Under pressure
Pressure

I'M STILL STANDING

You could never know what it's like
Your blood, like winter, freezes just like ice
And there's a cold, lonely light that shines from you
You'll wind up like the wreck you hide behind that mask you use
And did you think this fool could never win?
Well look at me, I'm a-coming back again
I got a taste of love in a simple way
And if you need to know while I'm still standing
You just fade away

Don't you know I'm still standing better than I ever did?
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
And I'm still standing after all this time
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind

I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)

Once, I never coulda hoped to win
You starting down the road, leaving me again
The threats you made were meant to cut me down
And if our love was just a circus, you'd be a clown by now
You know I'm still standing better than I ever did
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
And I'm still standing after all this time
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind

I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)


Don't you know that I'm still standing better than I ever did?
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
And I'm still standing after all this time
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind

I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)

I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)

I STILL HAVEN'T FOUND WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR

I have climbed the highest mountains
I have run through the fields
Only to be with you
Only to be with you
I have run, I have crawled
I have scaled these city walls
These city walls
Only to be with you

But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for

I have kissed honey lips
Felt the healing in her fingertips
It burned like fire
This burning desire
I have spoke with the tongue of angels
I have held the hand of a devil
It was warm in the night
I was cold as a stone
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for


I believe in the Kingdom Come
Then all the colours will bleed into one
Bleed into one
But yes, I'm still running
You broke the bonds and you loosed the chains
Carried the cross of my shame
Of my shame
You know I believe it

But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for

WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT

You must understand though the touch of your hand
Makes my pulse react
That it's only the thrill of boy meeting girl
Opposites attract
It's physical
Only logical
You must try to ignore that it means more than that

What's love got to do, got to do with it?
What's love but a second-hand emotion?
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?

It may seem to you that I'm acting confused
When you're close to me
If I tend to look dazed I've read it someplace
I've got cause to be
There's a name for it
There's a phrase that fits
But whatever the reason you do it for me

What's love got to do, got to do with it?
What's love but a second-hand emotion?
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?
I've been taking on a new direction
But I have to say
I've been thinking about my own protection
It scares me to feel this way

What's love got to do, got to do with it?
What's love but a second-hand emotion?
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?

What's love got to do, got to do with it?
What's love but a sweet old-fashioned notion?
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?

What's love got to do, got to do with it?
What's love but a second-hand emotion?
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?

What's love?
Got to do it
Got to do it
What's love?

TAKE ON ME

We're talking away
I don't know what I'm to say
I'll say it anyway
Today's another day to find you
Shying away
I'll be coming for your love, okay?

Take on me (Take on me)
Take me on (Take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day or two

So needless to say
I'm odds and ends
But I'll be stumbling away
Slowly learning that life is okay
Say after me
It's no better to be safe than sorry

Take on me (Take on me)
Take me on (Take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day or two

Oh, things that you say
Is it a life or just to play my worries away?
You're all the things I've got to remember
You're shying away
I'll be coming for you anyway

Take on me (Take on me)
Take me on (Take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day
Take on me (Take on me)
Take me on (Take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day

EVERY BREATH YOU TAKE

Every breath you take
And every move you make
Every bond you break
Every step you take, I'll be watching you
Every single day and every word you say
Every game you play
Every night you stay, I'll be watching you

Oh, can't you see you belong to me?
How my poor heart aches
With every step you take

Every move you make
And every vow you break
Every smile you fake
Every claim you stake, I'll be watching you

Since you've gone
I've been lost without a trace
I dream at night I can only see your face
I look around, but it's you I can't replace
I feel so cold, and I long for your embrace
I keep crying baby, baby, please

Oh, can't you see you belong to me?
How my poor heart aches
With every step you take

Every move you make
And every vow you break
Every smile you fake
Every claim you stake, I'll be watching you
Every move you make
Every step you take, I'll be watching you

I'll be watching you
(Every breath you take, every move you make)
(Every bond you break, every step you take)
I'll be watching you
(Every single day, every word you say)
(Every game you play, every night you stay)
I'll be watching you
(Every move you make, every vow you break)
(Every smile you fake, every claim you stake)

BILLIE JEAN

She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said, "Don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?"
She said I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean
As she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of bein' the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

People always told me, "Be careful of what you do
Don't go around breakin' young girls' hearts" (Hee-hee)
And mother always told me, "Be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do (Oh-oh)
'Cause the lie becomes the truth" (Oh-oh)
Hey-ay

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son, hoo!
She says I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son (Hee-hee-hee, no-no-no, hee-hee-hee)
Hoo!
For forty days and for forty nights, the law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand?
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, hee!
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
(Don't think twice) Do think twice! (A-hoo!)
She told my baby we'd danced till three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby cryin', his eyes were like mine (Oh, no)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby
(Ooh, hee-hee-hee)

People always told me, "Be careful of what you do
And don't go around breakin' young girls' hearts"
(Don't break no hearts!) (Hee-hee)
But she came and stood right by me
Just the smell of sweet perfume (Ha-oh)
This happened much too soon (Ha-oh, ha-ooh)
She called me to her room (Ha-oh, hoo!)
Hey-ay

Billie Jean is not my lover (Hoo!)
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
No-no-no, no-no-no-no-no-no (Hoo!)
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (Oh baby)
But the kid is not my son (Oh, no, no)
She says I am the one (Oh baby)
But the kid is not my son (No, hee-hee!)
Ah, hee-hee-hee!
Hee! Hoo!

She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
No-no-no, hoo! (Ouw!)
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
(You know what you did to me, baby)
But the kid is not my son
No-no-no, no-no-no-no (No-no-no, no-no-no)
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son (No-no-no-no)

She says I am the one
You know what you did
She says he is my son
Breakin' my heart, babe
She says I am the one
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover (She is just a girl)
Billie Jean is not my lover (She is just a girl)
(Don't call me Billie Jean)
Billie Jean is not my lover (She is just a girl)
(Hoo! She's not at the scene)
Billie Jean is not (Hee! Aaow! Ooh!)
Billie Jean is

I WANNA DANCE WITH SOMEBODY

Clock strikes upon the hour
And the sun begins to fade
Still enough time to figure out
How to chase my blues away
I've done alright up 'til now
It's the light of day that shows me how
And when the night falls
Loneliness calls

Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

I've been in love and lost my senses
Spinning through the town
Sooner or later, the fever ends
And I wind up feeling down
I need a woman who'll take a chance
On a love that burns hot enough to last
When the night falls
My lonely heart calls
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah! I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah! I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

SUMMER OF '69

I got my first real six string
Bought it at the five and dime
Played it til my fingers bled
Was the summer of '69

Me and some guys from school
Had a band and we tried real hard
Jimmy quit and Jody got married
I shoulda known we'd never get far

But when I look back now
That summer seemed to last forever
And if I had the choice
Ya, I'd always wanna be there
Those were the best days of my life

Ain't no use in complainin'
When you got a job to do
Spent my evenin's down at the drive-in
And that's when I met you, ya

Standin' on your mama's porch
You told me that you'd wait forever
Oh, and when you held my hand
I knew that it was now or never
Those were the best days of my life
Oh Yeah!
Back in the summer of '69
Oh!
Man, we were killin' time
We were young and restless
We needed to unwind
I guess nothin' can last forever
Forever, no...

Yeah!

And now the times are changin'
Look at everything that's come and gone
Sometimes when I play that old six string
I think about ya 'n wonder what went wrong

Standin' on your mama's porch
You told me it would last forever
Oh, the way you held my hand
I knew that it was now or never
Those were the best days of my life

Oh yeah
Back in the summer of '69
Uh-huh
It was the summer of '69
Oh yeah
Me and my baby in a 69
Oh! Oh!
It was the summer, summer, summer of 69

ANOTHER ONE BITES THE DUST

Ooh, let's go!

Steve walks warily down the street
With the brim pulled way down low
Ain't no sound but the sound of his feet
Machine guns ready to go
Are you ready? Hey, are you ready for this?
Are you hanging on the edge of your seat?
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat, yeah

Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust, yeah
Hey, I'm gonna get you too
Another one bites the dust
How do you think I'm going to get along
Without you, when you're gone
You took me for everything that I had
And kicked me out on my own
Are you happy, are you satisfied?
How long can you stand the heat?
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat
Look out
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust
Hey, I'm gonna get you, too
Another one bites the dust

Hey
Oh, take it
Bite the dust, hey
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust, ow
Another one bites the dust, hey hey
Another one bites the dust, hey-eh-eh
Ooh
There are plenty of ways you can hurt a man
And bring him to the ground
You can beat him, you can cheat him, you can treat him bad
And leave him when he's down, yeah
But I'm ready, yes I'm ready for you
I'm standing on my own two feet
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
Repeating the sound of the beat
Oh yeah
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust, yeah
Hey, I'm gonna get you, too
Another one bites the dust

Shoot out
Ay-yeah
Alright

JUST THE TWO OF US

I see the crystal raindrops fall
And the beauty of it all
Is when the sun comes shining through
To make those rainbows in my mind
When I think of you sometime
And I want to spend some time with you

Just the two of us
We can make it if we try
Just the two of us
(Just the two of us)
Just the two of us
Building castles in the sky
Just the two of us
You and I

We look for love, no time for tears
Wasted water's all that is
And it don't make no flowers grow
Good things might come to those who wait
Not for those who wait too late
We gotta go for all we know
Just the two of us
We can make it if we try
Just the two of us
(Just the two of us)
Just the two of us
Building them castles in the sky
Just the two of us
You and I

I hear the crystal raindrops fall
On the window down the hall
And it becomes the morning dew
And, darling, when the morning comes
And I see the morning sun
I want to be the one with you

Just the two of us
We can make it if we try
Just the two of us
(Just the two of us)
Just the two of us
Building big castles way up high
Just the two of us
You and I

BREAK MY STRIDE

Last night, I had the strangest dream
I sailed away to China
In a little rowboat to find ya
And you said you had to get your laundry clean
Didn't want no one to hold you, what does that mean?
And you said

Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
Nobody gonna slow me down
Oh no, I got to keep on moving
Ain't nothin' gonna break-a my stride
I'm runnin' and I won't touch ground
Oh no, I got to keep on moving

You're on a roll and now you pray it lasts
The road behind was rocky
But now you're feeling cocky
You look at me and you see your past
Is that the reason why you're runnin' so fast?
And she said

Ain't nothin' gonna break-a my stride
Nobody gonna slow me down
Oh no, I got to keep on moving
Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
I'm runnin' and I won't touch ground
Oh no, I got to keep on moving
(Never let another girl like you)
Work me over
(Never let another girl like you)
Drag me under
(If I meet another girl like you)
I will tell her
(Never want another girl like you)
Have to say, oh

Ain't nothin' gonna break-a my stride
Nobody gonna slow me down
Oh no (Oh no), I got to keep on moving
Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
I'm runnin' and I won't touch ground
Oh no, I got to keep on moving
Ain't nothin' gonna break-a my stride
Nobody gonna slow me down
Oh no (Oh no), I got to keep on moving
Ain't nothin' gonna break-a my stride
I'm runnin' and I won't touch ground
Oh no, I got to keep on moving
(Whoa)
Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
Nobody gonna slow me down
Oh no, I got to keep on moving
Ain't nothin' gonna break-a my stride
I'm runnin' and I won't touch ground
Oh no, I got to keep on moving
Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
Nobody gonna slow me down
Oh no (Oh no), I got to keep on moving

EVERYBODY WANTS TO RULE THE WORLD

Welcome to your life
There's no turning back
Even while we sleep
We will find you

Acting on your best behaviour
Turn your back on mother nature
Everybody wants to rule the world

It's my own design
It's my own remorse
Help me to decide
Help me make the

Most of freedom and of pleasure
Nothing ever lasts forever
Everybody wants to rule the world

There's a room where the light won't find you
Holding hands while the walls come tumbling down
When they do, I'll be right behind you
So glad we've almost made it
So sad they had to fade it
Everybody wants to rule the world

I can't stand this indecision
Married with a lack of vision
Everybody wants to rule the world
Say that you'll never, never, never, never need it
One headline, why believe it?
Everybody wants to rule the world

All for freedom and for pleasure
Nothing ever lasts forever
Everybody wants to rule the world

COME ON EILEEN

Come on Eileen!
Come on Eileen!

Poor old Johnnie Ray
Sounded sad upon the radio
Moved a million hearts in mono
Our mothers cried
Sang along, who'd blame them?
You've grown (You’re grown up!)
So grown (So grown up!)
Now I must say more than ever
(Come on Eileen)
Too-ra-loo-ra, too-ra-loo-rye, ay
And we can sing just like our fathers

Come on Eileen
Oh, I swear (What he means)
At this moment you mean everything
You in that dress
My thoughts (I confess)
Verge on dirty
Oh, come on Eileen
(Come on Eileen!)

These people round here
Were beaten down, eyes sunk in smoke-dried face
They're so resigned to what their fate is
But not us (No never)
But not us (Not ever)
We are far too young and clever
(Remember)
Too-ra-loo-ra, too-ra-loo-rye, ay
And you'll hum this tune forever, oh

Come on Eileen
Oh, I swear (What he means)
Aah, come on let's
Take off everything
That pretty red dress
Eileen (Tell him yes)
Aah, come on let's
Aah, come on Eileen
That pretty red dress
Eileen (Tell him yes)
Aah, come on let's
Aah, come on Eileen
Please
(Come on Eileen, tah-loo-rye-ay)
(Come on Eileen, tah-loo-rye-ay)
(Tooh rah, tooh ra, tah roo rye)
Now you're full grown
Now you have shown
Oh, Eileen
(Come on Eileen, tah-loo-rye-ay)
(Come on Eileen, tah-loo-rye-ay)
(Tooh rah, tooh ra, tah roo rye)
Say, come on Eileen (You’ve grown)
These things they are real and I know (So grown)
How you feel
Now I must say more than ever
Things round here have changed
(Come on Eileen, tah-loo-rye-aye)
(Come on Eileen, tah-loo-rye-aye)
I say, too-ra-loo-ra, too-ra-loo-rye-ay

Come on Eileen
Oh, I swear (What he means)
At this moment
You mean everything
You in that dress, my thoughts I confess
Verge on dirty
Aah, come on Eileen
Aah, come on Eileen
Oh, I swear (What he means)
At this moment, you mean everything
You in that dress
Oh, my thoughts I confess
Well, they're dirty
Come on Eileen

Come on Eileen (Oh)
What he means (Oh)
You mean everything (Oh)
(Come on! come on!)
In that dress
Oh

Oh believe me if all those endearing young charms
That I gaze on so fondly today
Were to suddenly leave you, or fly in the night
Just like fairy gifts gone in the sky

JESSIE'S GIRL

Jessie is a friend
Yeah, I know, he's been a good friend of mine
But lately something's changed that ain't hard to define
Jessie's got himself a girl, and I wanna make her mine

And she's watching him with those eyes
And she's lovin' him with that body
I just know it
And he's holding her in his arms late, late at night

You know I wish that I had Jessie's girl
I wish that I had Jessie's girl
Where can I find a woman like that?

I'll play along with this charade
That doesn't seem to be a reason to change
You know I feel so dirty when they start talking cute
I wanna tell her that I love her, but the point is probably moot

'Cause she's watching him with those eyes
And she's lovin' him with that body
I just know it
And he's holding her in his arms late, late at night
You know I wish that I had Jessie's girl
I wish that I had Jessie's girl
Where can I find a woman like that?
Like Jessie's girl
I wish that I had Jessie's girl
Where can I find a woman...
Where can I find a woman like that?

And I'm lookin' in the mirror all the time
Wonderin' what she don't see in me
I've been funny; I've been cool with the lines
Ain't that the way love's supposed to be?

Tell me where can I find a woman like that?
You know I wish that I had Jessie's girl
I wish that I had Jessie's girl
I want Jessie's girl
Where can I find a woman like that?
Like Jessie's girl
I wish that I had Jessie's girl
I want, I want Jessie's girl

GYPSY

So I'm back, to the velvet underground
Back to the floor, that I love
To a room with some lace and paper flowers
Back to the gypsy that I was
To the gypsy that I was

And it all comes down to you
Well you know that it does
And lightning strikes, maybe once, maybe twice
Oh, and it lights up the night
And you see your gypsy
You see your gypsy

To the gypsy that remains
Faces freedom with a little fear
I have no fear, I have only love
And if I was a child
And the child was enough
Enough for me to love
Enough to love

She is dancing away from me now
She was just a wish
She was just a wish
And a memory is all that is left for you now
You see your gypsy, oh
You see your gypsy
Lightning strikes, maybe once, maybe twice
And it all comes down to you
And it all comes down to you
Lightning strikes, maybe once, maybe twice
And it all comes down to you
And it all comes down to you

I still see your bright eyes, bright eyes
And it all comes down to you
I still see your bright eyes, bright eyes
And it all comes down to you
I still see your bright eyes, bright eyes
(She was just a wish)
(She was just a wish)
And it all comes down to you
Lightning strikes, maybe once, maybe twice
And it all comes down to you

ROCK WITH YOU

Girl, close your eyes
Let that rhythm get into you
Don't try to fight it
There ain't nothin' that you can do
Relax your mind
Lay back and groove with mine

You gotta feel that heat
And we can ride the boogie
Share that beat of love

I wanna rock with you (All night)
Dance you into day (Sunlight)
I wanna rock with you (All night)
We're gonna rock the night away (Rock, right)

Out on the floor
There ain't nobody there but us
Girl, when you dance
There's a magic that must be love
Just take it slow
'Cause we got so far to go
When you feel that heat
And we're gonna ride the boogie
Share that beat of love

I wanna rock with you (All night)
Dance you into day (Sunlight)

LAY ALL YOUR LOVE ON ME

I wasn't jealous before we met
Now every woman I see is a potential threat
And I'm possessive, it isn't nice
You've heard me saying that smoking was my only vice

But now it isn't true
Now everything is new
And all I've learned has overturned
I beg of you

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me

It was like shooting a sitting duck
A little small talk, a smile, and baby, I was stuck
I still don't know what you've done with me
A grown-up woman should never fall so easily

I feel a kind of fear
When I don't have you near
Unsatisfied, I skip my pride
I beg you, dear
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me

I've had a few little love affairs
They didn't last very long and they've been pretty scarce
I used to think that was sensible
It makes the truth even more incomprehensible

'Cause everything is new
And everything is you
And all I've learned has overturned
What can I do?

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me

PRIVATE EYES

I see you, you see me
Watch you blowing the lines when you're making a scene
Oh, girl, you've got to know
What my head overlooks the senses will show
To my heart, when it's watching for lies
You can't escape my

Private eyes
They're watching you
They see your every move
Private eyes
They're watching you
Private eyes
They're watching you
Watching you
Watching you
Watching you

You play with words, you play with love
You can twist it around, baby, that ain't enough
'Cause girl, I'm going to know
If you're letting me in or letting me go
Don't lie when you're hurting inside
'Cause you can't escape my
Private eyes
They're watching you
They see your every move, baby
Private eyes
They're watching you
Private eyes
They're watching you
Watching you
Watching you
Watching you


Why you try to put up a front for me?
I'm a spy but on your side, you see
Slip on into any disguise
I'll still know you, look into my

Private eyes
They're watching you
They see your every move
Private eyes
They're watching you
Private eyes
They're watching you
Private eyes
They're watching you
They see your every move
Private eyes
They're watching you

NEVER TOO MUCH

I can't fool myself, I don't want nobody else to ever love me
You are my shining star, my guiding light, my love fantasy
There's not a minute, hour, day or night that I don't love you
You're at the top of my list 'cause I'm always thinking of you
I still remember in the days when I was scared to touch you
How I spent my day dreaming planning how to say I love you
You must have known that I had feelings deep enough to swim in
That's when you opened up your heart and you told me to come in

Oh, my love
A thousand kisses from you is never too much
I just don't wanna stop
Oh, my love
A million days in your arms is never too much
I just don't wanna stop

Too much, never too much, never too much, never too much

Woke up today, looked at your picture just to get me started
I called you up, but you weren't there and I was broken-hearted
Hung up the phone, can't be too late, the boss is so demanding
Opened the door up and to my surprise there you were standing
Well, who needs to go to work to hustle for another dollar
I'd rather be with you 'cause you make my heart scream and holler
Love is a gamble and I'm so glad that I am winning
We've come a long way and yet this is only the beginning
Oh, my love
A thousand kisses from you is never too much
(Never too much, never too much, never too much)
I just don't wanna stop
Oh, my love
A million days in your arms is never too much
(Never too much, never too much, never too much)
And I just don't wanna stop
Oh, my love
A thousand kisses from you is never
(Never too much, never too much, never too much)
I just don't wanna stop
Oh, my love
A million days in your arms is never too much

UPTOWN GIRL

Uptown girl
She's been living in her uptown world
I bet she's never had a backstreet guy
I bet her momma never told her why
I'm gonna try for an

Uptown girl
She's been living in her white bread world
As long as anyone with hot blood can
And now she's looking for a downtown man
That's what I am

And when she knows what she wants from her time
And when she wakes up and makes up her mind

She'll see I'm not so tough
Just because I'm in love with an

Uptown girl
You know I've seen her in her uptown world
She's getting tired of her high class toys
And all the presents from her uptown boys
She's got a choice
Uptown girl
You know I can't afford to buy her pearls
But maybe someday when my ship comes in
She'll understand what kind of guy I've been
And then I'll win

And when she's walking, she's looking so fine
And when she's talking, she'll say that she's mine

She'll say I'm not so tough
Just because I'm in love with an

Uptown girl
She's been living in her white bread world
As long as anyone with hot blood can
And now she's looking for a downtown man
That's what I am

Uptown girl, she's my uptown girl
You know I'm in love with an uptown girl, my uptown girl
You know I'm in love with an uptown girl, my uptown girl
You know I'm in love with an uptown girl, my uptown girl
You know I'm in love with an uptown girl

KOKOMO

Aruba, Jamaica, ooh I wanna take ya
Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego
Baby why don't we go
Jamaica

Off the Florida Keys
There's a place called Kokomo
That's where you wanna go
To get away from it all
Bodies in the sand
Tropical drink melting in your hand
We'll be falling in love
To the rhythm of a steel drum band
Down in Kokomo

Aruba, Jamaica, ooh I wanna take you to
Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego
Baby why don't we go
Ooh I wanna take you down to Kokomo
We'll get there fast
And then we'll take it slow
That's where we wanna go
Way down in Kokomo
Martinique, that Montserrat mystique
We'll put out to sea
We'll perfect our chemistry
By and by we'll defy
A little bit of gravity
Afternoon delight
Cocktails and moonlit nights
That dreamy look in your eye
Give me a tropical contact high
Way down in Kokomo

Aruba, Jamaica, ooh I wanna take you to
Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego
Baby why don't we go
Ooh I wanna take you down to Kokomo
We'll get there fast
And then we'll take it slow

Way down in Kokomo
Port au Prince, I want to catch a glimpse
Everybody knows a little place like Kokomo
Now if you wanna go to get away from it all
Go down to Kokomo

RASPBERRY BERET

One, two
One, two, three, uh!

I was working part time in a five-and-dime
My boss was Mr. McGee
He told me several times that he didn't like my kind
'Cause I was a bit too leisurely
Seems that I was busy doing something close to nothing
But different than the day before
That's when I saw her, ooh, I saw her
She walked in through the out door, out door
She wore a...

Raspberry beret
The kind you find in a second hand store
Raspberry beret
And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more
Raspberry beret
I think I love her

Built like she was
She had the nerve to ask me
If I planned to do her any harm
So, look here
I put her on the back of my bike
And-a we went riding
Down by old man Johnson's farm
I said now, overcast days never turned me on
But something about the clouds and her mixed
She wasn't too bright
But I could tell when she kissed me
She knew how to get her kicks
She wore a...
Raspberry beret
The kind you find in a second hand store
Raspberry beret
And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more
Raspberry beret
I think I love her

The rain sounds so cool when it hits the barn roof
And the horses wonder who you are
Thunder drowns out what the lightning sees
You feel like a movie star
Listen, they say the first time ain't the greatest
But I tell you, if I had the chance to do it all again
I wouldn't change a stroke
'Cause baby I'm the most
With a girl as fine as she was then

Raspberry beret
The kind you find in a second hand store
Raspberry beret
And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more
Raspberry beret
I think I love her

YOU MAKE MY DREAMS

What I want, you've got
And it might be hard to handle
But like a flame that burns the candle
The candle feeds the flame
Yeah, yeah, what I've got, full stock
Of thoughts and dreams that scatter
If you pull them all together
And a-how, I can't explain

Oh yeah, well, well you (Ooh, ooh, ooh ooh ooh)
You make a-my dreams come true
(You) You (You, you, ooh ooh ooh, you)
Well, well, well you (Ooh, ooh, ooh ooh ooh)
Oh yeah, a-you make a-my dreams come true

Well yeah

On a night when bad
Dreams become a screamer
When they're messing with the dreamer
I can laugh it in the face
Twist and shout my way out
And wrap yourself around me
'Cause a-I ain't the way you found me
And I'll never be the same
Oh yeah, well, 'cause you (Ooh, ooh, ooh ooh ooh)
Mmm hmm, you make a-my dreams come true
(You, you, you, ooh ooh ooh, you)
Whoa yeah, well, well, well you (Ooh, ooh, ooh ooh ooh)

Oh, that sleepwalk should be over by now, I know

DON'T WORRY BE HAPPY

Here's a little song I wrote
You might want to sing it note for note
Don't worry, be happy
In every life we have some trouble
But when you worry you make it double
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy now

Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy

Ain't got no place to lay your head
Somebody came and took your bed
Don't worry, be happy
The landlord say your rent is late
He may have to litigate
Don't worry, be happy (Look at me, I'm happy)

Don't worry, be happy
(Hey I'll give you my phone number, when you worry call me I'll make you happy!)
Don't worry, be happy
Ain't got no cash, ain't got no style
Ain't got no gal to make you smile
But don't worry, be happy
'Cause when you worry your face will frown
And that will bring everybody down
So don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy now

Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy

Now there is the song I wrote
I hope you learned it note for note, like good little children
Don't worry, be happy
Now listen to what I said, in your life expect some trouble
When you worry you make it double
But don't worry, be happy, be happy now

Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy
(Don't worry, don't worry, don't do it, be happy
Put a smile on your face
Don't bring everybody down like this
Don't worry, it will soon pass whatever it is)
Don't worry, be happy
I'm not worried
I'm happy

MATERIAL GIRL

Some boys kiss me, some boys hug me
I think they're okay
If they don't give me proper credit, I just walk away
They can beg and they can plead
But they can't see the light (That's right)
'Cause the boy with the cold hard cash is always Mister Right

'Cause we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

Some boys romance, some boys slow dance
That's all right with me
If they can't raise my interest, then I have to let them be
Some boys try, and some boys lie
But I don't let them play, no way
Only boys that save their pennies make my rainy day

'Cause we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
Living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
Living in a material world (-Terial)
Living in a material world
Living in a material world (-Terial)
Living in a material world

Boys may come, and boys may go
And that's all right, you see
Experience has made me rich, and now they're after me

'Cause everybody's living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
Living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

A material, a material, a material, a material world
Living in a material world (-Terial)
Living in a material world
Living in a material world (-Terial)
Living in a material world
Living in a material world (-Terial)
Living in a material world

9 TO 5

Tumble outta bed and stumble to the kitchen
Pour myself a cup of ambition
Yawnin' and stretchin' and try to come to life
Jump in the shower and the blood starts pumpin'
Out on the streets, the traffic starts jumpin'
With folks like me on the job from 9 to 5

Working 9 to 5, what a way to make a living
Barely gettin' by, it's all taking and no giving
They just use your mind and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
9 to 5, for service and devotion
You would think that I would deserve a fair promotion
Want to move ahead but the boss won't seem to let me
I swear sometimes that man is out to get me
Mmmmm...

They let you dream just to watch them shatter
You're just a step on the boss man's ladder
But you got dreams he'll never take away
In the same boat with a lot of your friends
Waiting for the day your ship will come in
And the tide's gonna turn an' it's all gonna roll your way
Working 9 to 5, what a way to make a living
Barely gettin' by, it's all taking and no giving
They just use your mind and you never get the credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
9 to 5, yeah, they got you where they want you
There's a better life and you think about it don't you
It's a rich man's game no matter what they call it
And you spend your life putting money in his wallet
9 to 5, what a way to make a living

JUST LIKE HEAVEN

"Show me, show me, show me how you do that trick
The one that makes me scream", she said
"The one that makes me laugh", she said
And threw her arms around my neck
"Show me how you do it, and I promise you
I promise that I'll run away with you
I'll run away with you"

Spinning on that dizzy edge
Kissed her face and kissed her head
Dreamed of all the different ways I had to make her glow
"Why are you so far away?", she said
"Why won't you ever know that I'm in love with you?
That I'm in love with you?"

You, soft and only
You, lost and lonely
You, strange as angels
Dancing in the deepest oceans
Twisting in the water
You're just like a dream
You're just like a dream
Daylight licked me into shape
I must have been asleep for days
And moving lips to breathe her name
I opened up my eyes
And found myself alone, alone
Alone above a raging sea
That stole the only girl I loved
And drowned her deep inside of me

You, soft and only
You, lost and lonely
You, just like heaven
***************

EVERYWHERE

Calling out your name
Calling out your name

Can you hear me calling
Out your name?
You know that I'm falling
And I don't know what to say
I'll speak a little louder
I'll even shout
You know that I'm proud
And I can't get the words out

Oh I
I wanna be with you everywhere
Oh I
I wanna be with you everywhere
(I wanna be with you everywhere...)

Something's happening
Happening to me
My friends say I'm acting peculiarly
Come along, baby
We better make a start
You better make it soon
Before you break my heart
Oh I
I wanna be with you everywhere
Oh I
I wanna be with you everywhere
(I wanna be with you everywhere...)

THERE IS A LIGHT THAT NEVER GOES OUT

Take me out tonight
Where there's music and there's people
And they're young and alive
Driving in your car
I never, never want to go home
Because I haven't got one anymore
Take me out tonight
Because I want to see people
And I want to see life
Driving in your car, oh, please don't drop me home
Because it's not my home, it's their home
And I'm welcome no more

And if a double-decker bus crashes into us
To die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
And if a ten-tonne truck kills the both of us
To die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine

Take me out tonight
Take me anywhere, I don't care, I don't care
I don't care
And in the darkened underpass
I thought "Oh God, my chance has come at last"
But then a strange fear gripped me and I just couldn't ask
Take me out tonight
Oh, take me anywhere, I don't care, I don't care
I don't care
Driving in your car
I never, never want to go home
Because I haven't got one, la-di-dum, oh, I haven't got one
Oh, oh
And if a double-decker bus crashes into us
To die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
And if a ten-tonne truck kills the both of us
To die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine

Oh, there is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out

HIP TO BE SQUARE

I used to be a renegade, I used to fool around
But I couldn't take the punishment and had to settle down
Now I'm playing it real straight, and yes, I cut my hair
You might think I'm crazy, but I don't even care
Because I can tell what's going on
It's hip to be square
It's hip to be square

I like my bands in business suits, I watch them on TV
I'm working out most every day and watching what I eat
They tell me that it's good for me, but I don't even care
I know that it's crazy
I know that it's nowhere
But there is no denying that
It's hip to be square
It's hip to be square
It's hip to be square
So hip to be square

It's not too hard to figure out, you see it every day
And those that were the farthest out have gone the other way
You see them on the freeway, it don't look like a lot of fun
But don't you try to fight it, an idea whose time has come
Don't tell me that I'm crazy
Don't tell me I'm nowhere
Take it from me

It's hip to be square
It's hip to be square
It's hip to be square
So hip to be square
Tell 'em, boys

Here, there, and everywhere
Hip, hip, so hip to be square
Here, there, and everywhere
Hip, hip
Here, there, and everywhere
Hip, hip, so hip to be square
Here, there, and everywhere
Hip, hip

Hip, hip, so hip to be square

CENTERFOLD

Come on!

Does she walk? Does she talk?
Does she come complete?
My homeroom homeroom angel
Always pulled me from my seat
She was pure like snowflakes
No one could ever stain
The memory of my angel
Could never cause me pain

Years go by
I'm looking through a girly magazine
And there's my homeroom angel
On the pages in-between

My blood runs cold
My memory has just been sold
My angel is the centerfold
Angel is the centerfold
My blood runs cold (Woo!)
My memory has just been sold
Angel is the centerfold
Slipped me notes under the desk
While I was thinking about her dress
I was shy I turned away
Before she caught my eye
I was shaking in my shoes
Whenever she flashed those baby-blues
Something had a hold on me
When angel passed close by

Those soft and fuzzy sweaters
Too magical to touch
To see her in that negligee
Is really just too much

My blood runs cold (Yeah)
My memory has just been sold
My angel is the centerfold

I'll see you when your clothes are on
Take your car, yes, we will
We'll take your car and drive it
We'll take it to a motel room
And take 'em off in private

A part of me has just been ripped
The pages from my mind are stripped
Oh no, I can't deny it
Oh yeah, I guess I gotta buy it

My blood runs cold
My memory has just been sold

SHOULD I STAY OR SHOULD I GO

Oh! Hola!

Darling, you got to let me know
Should I stay or should I go?
If you say that you are mine
I'll be here 'till the end of time
So you got to let me know
Should I stay or should I go?

It's always tease, tease, tease
You're happy when I'm on my knees
One day it's fine and next it's black
So if you want me off your back
Well, come on and let me know
Should I stay or should I go?

Should I stay or should I go now?
Should I stay or should I go now?
If I go, there will be trouble
And if I stay it will be double
So come on and let me know
This indecision's bugging me (Esta indecisión me molesta)
If you don't want me, set me free (Si no me quieres, librarme)
Exactly whom I'm supposed to be (Dígame que tengo ser)
Don't you know which clothes even fit me? (Sabes que ropa me "quedrá"?)
Come on and let me know (Me tienes que decir)
Should I cool it or should I blow? (Me debo ir o quedarme?)

KIDS IN AMERICA

Looking out a dirty old window
Down below the cars in the city go rushing by
I sit here alone and I wonder why
Friday night and everyone's moving
I can feel the heat but it's soothing, heading down
I search for the beat in this dirty town

Downtown the young ones are going
Downtown the young ones are growing

We're the kids in America (Whoa)
We're the kids in America (Whoa)
Everybody live for the music-go-round

Bright lights, the music gets faster
Look, boy, don't check on your watch, not another glance
I'm not leaving now, honey, not a chance
Hot-shot, give me no problems
Much later, baby, you'll be saying nevermind
You know life is cruel, life is never kind

Kind hearts don't make a new story
Kind hearts don't grab any glory
We're the kids in America (Whoa)
We're the kids in America (Whoa)
Everybody live for the music-go-round

La la la la-la la-a
La la la la-la la (Sing)
La la la la-la la-a
La la la la-la la

Come closer, honey, that's better
Got to get a brand new experience, feeling right
Oh, don't try to stop, baby, hold me tight
Outside a new day is dawning
Outside suburbia's sprawling everywhere
I don't want to go, baby

New York to east California
There's a new wave coming, I warn ya

We're the kids in America (Whoa)
We're the kids in America (Whoa)
Everybody lives for the music-go-round
La la la la-la la-a
La la la la-la la (Sing)
La la la la-la la-a
La la la la-la la

We're the kids
We're the kids
We're the kids in America
We're the kids
We're the kids
We're the kids in America
We're the kids
We're the kids
We're the kids in America

JACK & DIANE

Little ditty about Jack and Diane
Two American kids growin' up in the heartland
Jack, he's gonna be a football star
Diane's debutante backseat of Jacky's car

Suckin' on a chili dog outside the Tastee Freez
Diane's sittin' on Jacky's lap, he's got his hand between her knees
Jacky say, "Hey Diane, lets run off behind a shady tree
Dribble off those Bobby Brooks slacks, now do what I please"
Say a....

Oh yeah, life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone
I say, oh yeah say life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone
Now walk on

Jacky sits back, collects his thoughts for the moment
Scratches his head and does his best James Dean
"Well then, there Diane, we ought to run off to the city"
Diane says, "Baby, you ain't missin' nothing"
But Jacky say a...
Oh yeah, life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone
Oh yeah I say life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone

Gonna let it rock, let it roll
Let the Bible Belt come and save my soul
Holdin on to sixteen as long as you can
Changes come around real soon
Make us women and men

Oh yeah, life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone
Oh yeah they say life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone

A little ditty about Jack and Diane
Two American kids doing the best they can

WE BUILT THIS CITY

We built this city
We built this city on rock and roll
Built this city
We built this city on rock and roll

Say you don't know me
Or recognize my face
Say you don't care who goes
To that kind of place
Knee deep in the hoopla
Sinking in your fight
Too many runaways
Eating up the night

Marconi plays the mamba
Listen to the radio, don't you remember?
We built this city
We built this city on rock and roll

We built this city
We built this city on rock and roll
Built this city
We built this city on rock and roll
Someone always playing
Corporation games
Who cares they're always changing
Corporation names
We just want to dance here
Someone stole the stage
They call us irresponsible
Write us off the page

Marconi plays the mamba
Listen to the radio, don't you remember?
We built this city
We built this city on rock and roll

We built this city
We built this city on rock and roll
Built this city
We built this city on rock and roll

It's just another Sunday
In a tired old street
Police have got the choke hold, oh
And we just lost the beat
Who counts the money
Underneath the bar
Who rides the wrecking ball
Into our guitars
Don't tell us you need us
'Cause we're the ship of fools
Looking for America
Coming through your schools
I'm looking out over that Golden Gate bridge
On another gorgeous sunny Saturday
And I'm seeing that bumper to bumper traffic
Don't you remember? ('Member, 'member)
It's your favorite radio station
In your favorite radio city
The city by the bay, the city that rocks
The city that never sleeps

Marconi plays the mamba
Listen to the radio, don't you remember?
We built this city
We built this city on rock and roll

We built this city
We built this city on rock and roll
Built this city
We built this city on rock and roll
Built this city (Oo-ho)
We built this city on rock and roll

HIGHER LOVE

Think about it, there must be higher love
Down in the heart or hidden in the stars above
Without it, life is wasted time
Look inside your heart, I'll look inside mine

Things look so bad everywhere
In this whole world, what is fair?
We walk blind and we try to see
Falling behind in what could be

Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love, ohoh
Bring me a higher love
Where's that higher love I keep thinking of?

Worlds are turning, and we're just hanging on
Facing our fear and standing out there alone
A yearning and it's real to me
There must be someone who's feeling for me
Things look so bad everywhere
In this whole world, what is fair?
We walk blind and we try to see
Falling behind in what could be

Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love, ohoh
Bring me a higher love
Where's that higher love I keep thinking of?
Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love, ohoh
Bring me a higher love
I could rise above on a higher love

I will wait for it
I'm not too late for it
Until then, I'll sing my song
To cheer the night along
Bring it

I could light the night up with my soul on fire
I could make the sun shine from pure desire
Let me feel that love come over me
Let me feel how strong it could be

Oh

Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love, ohoh
Bring me a higher love
Where's that higher love I keep thinking of?

Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love, ohoh (bring me)
Bring me a higher love, (ohoh)
Bring me a higher love, (ohoh, bring me higher)
Bring me a higher love (Bring it)
Bring me a higher love (Oh, I said bring it)
Bring me a higher love (Awww!)
Bring me a higher love (Oh-oh-oh, bring me higher love)
Bring me a higher love, ohoh (Bring me higher love)
Bring me a higher love (Bring it on, higher love)
Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love (oh yes)
Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love

1999

Don't worry, I won't hurt you...
I only want you to have some fun
(I was dreamin' when I wrote this
Forgive me if it goes astray)
But when I woke up this morning
I could have sworn it was judgement day
The sky was all purple
There were people runnin' everywhere
(Tryin' to run from the destruction
And you know I didn't even care)

'Cause they say...
(2000 zero zero, party over, oops, out of time
So tonight I'm gonna party like it's 1999)

(I was dreamin' when I wrote this
So sue me if I go too fast)
But life is just a party
And parties weren't meant to last
War is all around us
My mind says prepare to fight
(So if I gotta die
I'm gonna listen to my body tonight)
Yeah
'Cause they say...
(2000 zero zero, party over, oops, out of time
So tonight I'm gonna party like it's 1999)

Lemme tell ya somethin'...
(If you didn't come to party
Don't bother knockin' on my door)
(I got a lion in my pocket
And baby he's ready to roar)
Everybody's got a bomb
We could all die any day, Oh
(But before I'll let that happen
I'll dance my life away)

'Cause they say...
(2000 zero zero, party over, oops, out of time)
We're runnin' outta time

LITTLE LIES

​

If I could turn the page
In time, then I'd rearrange
Just a day or two
Close my, close my, close my eyes
But I couldn't find a way
So I'll settle for one day
To believe in you
Tell me, tell me, tell me lies

Tell me lies
Tell me sweet little lies
(Tell me lies, tell me, tell me lies)
Oh, no, no, you can't disguise
(You can't disguise, no, you can't disguise)
Tell me lies
Tell me sweet little lies

Although I'm not making plans
I hope that you understand
There's a reason why
Close your, close your, close your eyes
No more broken hearts
We're better off apart
Let's give it a try
Tell me, tell me, tell me lies
Tell me lies
Tell me sweet little lies
(Tell me lies, tell me, tell me lies)
Oh, no, no, you can't disguise
(You can't disguise, no, you can't disguise)
Tell me lies
Tell me sweet little lies

"15 miles to the
Love Shack"
Love Shack, yeah, yeah

Lookin' for the love getaway
Headed for the love getaway

HOW WILL I KNOW

There's a boy I know, he's the one I dream of
Looks into my eyes, takes me to the clouds above
Ooh I lose control, can't seem to get enough
When I wake from dreaming, tell me is it really love?

Ooh, how will I know? (Don't trust your feelings)
How will I know?
How will I know? (Love can be deceiving)
How will I know?

How will I know if he really loves me?
I say a prayer with every heart beat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you what you know about these things
How will I know if he's thinking of me?
I try to phone, but I'm too shy (Can't speak)
Falling in love is so bittersweet
This love is strong, why do I feel weak?

Oh, wake me, I'm shaking, wish I had you near me now
Said there's no mistaking, what I feel is really love
Ooh tell me
How will I know? (Don't trust your feelings)

SUPER TROUPER

Super Trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue
Like I always do
'Cause somewhere in the crowd, there's you

I was sick and tired of everything
When I called you last night from Glasgow
All I do is eat and sleep and sing
Wishing every show was the last show
(Wishing every show was the last show)

So imagine I was glad to hear you're coming
(Glad to hear you're coming)
Suddenly I feel all right
(And suddenly it's gonna be)
And it's gonna be so different
When I'm on the stage tonight

Tonight, the Super Trouper lights are gonna find me
Shining like the sun (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Smiling, having fun (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Feeling like a number one

But I won't feel blue (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Like I always do (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
'Cause somewhere in the crowd there's you
Facing twenty thousand of your friends
How can anyone be so lonely?
Part of a success that never ends
Still, I'm thinking about you only
(Still, I'm thinking about you only)

There are moments when I think I'm going crazy
(Think I'm going crazy)
But it's gonna be all right
(You'll soon be changing everything)
Everything will be so different
When I'm on the stage tonight

Tonight, the Super Trouper lights are gonna find me
Shining like the sun (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)

So I'll be there when you arrive
The sight of you will prove to me I'm still alive
And when you take me in your arms and hold me tight

DANCING WITH MYSELF

On the floors of Tokyo-o
Or down in London town to go, go
A-with the record selection and the mirror's reflection
I'm a-dancing with myself
Oh, when there's no one else in sight
A-in the crowded lonely night
Well, I wait so long for my love vibration
And I'm dancing with myself

Oh, oh, dancing with myself
Oh, oh, dancing with myself
When there's nothing to lose, and there's nothing to prove
And I'm dancing with myself, oh, oh, uh-oh

And there's every type of girl
But your empty eyes
Seem to pass me by
Leave me dancing with myself
So let's sink another drink
'Cause it'll give me time to think
If I had the chance, I'd ask the world to dance
And I'll be dancing with myself
Oh, oh, dancing with myself

GOT TO GIVE IT UP

I used to go out to parties
And stand around
Cause I was too nervous
To really get down
But my body yearned to be free
I got up on the floor and thought
Somebody could choose me
No more standin' there beside the walls
I done got myself together baby
And now I'm havin' a ball
As long as you're groovin'
There's always a chance
Somebody watches
Might wanna make romance
Move your body, ooo baby, you dance all night
To the groove and feel alright
Everybody's groovin' on like a fool
But if you see me spread out and let me in
Baby just party high and low
Let me step into your erotic zone
Move it up
Turn it 'round
Shake it down
OOWWWW
You can love me when you want to babe
This is such a groovy party baby
We're here face to face
Everybody's swingin'

VIDEO KILLED THE RADIO STAR

I heard you on the wireless back in '52
Lying awake, intently tuning in on you
If I was young, it didn't stop you coming through
Oh-a oh-a
They took the credit for your second symphony
Rewritten by machine on new technology
And now I understand the problems you could see

Oh-a oh-a
I met your children
Oh-a oh-a
What did you tell 'em?

Video killed the radio star
Video killed the radio star
Pictures came and broke your heart
Oh-a-a-a-oh

And now we meet in an abandoned studio (Oh-a)
We hear the playback and it seems so long ago (Oh-oh-oh-oh-a)
And you remember the jingles used to go
Oh-a oh-a
You were the first one
Oh-a oh-a
You were the last one

Video killed the radio star
Video killed the radio star
In my mind and in my car
We can't rewind, we've gone too far
Oh-a-a-a-oh
Oh-a-a-a-oh

Video killed the radio star
Video killed the radio star
In my mind and in my car
We can't rewind, we've gone too far
Pictures came and broke your heart
Put the blame on VCR

You are a radio star
You are a radio star

LOCO IN ACAPULCO

Going loco down in Acapulco
If you stay too long
Yes
You'll be going loco down in Acapulco
The magic down there is so strong
Feel the pressure
Your back's against the wall
Love is gaining on you
You're just about to fall
If you're afraid to love
Afraid to take a chance
You better hide your feelings
Get out while you can
Cause you'll be going loco down in Acapulco
If you stay too long
Cause you'll be going loco down in Acapulco
If you stay too long
The magic down there is so strong
You can hear voices bleeding through those warm Latin nights
Memories are lost and found
Leaving broken hearts all over town
Cause you'll be going loco down in Acapulco
If you stay too long
Cause you'll be going loco down in Acapulco
If you stay too long
The magic down there is so strong
You'll be pulling out your hair
Drowning in despair
With a whole lot of nothing on your way to nowhere
Your search for paradise will come to an end
When you realize what a fool you've been
You'll be haunted by her face
Missing her warm embrace
Memories of loving her
Holding her tight every night
Was that the best part of your life ?
Hearing her voice soft and low
Begging you to please
Please don't go
Don't go
No!
Don't go!
Don't go!
You can hear voices bleeding through those warm
Latin nights
Memories are lost and found
Leaving broken hearts
All over town, All over town
Cause you'll be going loco down in Acapulco
If you stay too long
Yes, you'll be going loco down in Acapulco
The magic down there is so strong
Going loco down in Acapulco
If you stay too long
Yes, you'll be going loco down in Acapulco
The magic down there is so strong
Going loco down in Acapulco
If you stay too long
Yes, you'll be going loco down in Acapulco
The magic down there is so strong

HOW SOON IS NOW?

I am the son and the heir
Of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
I am the son and heir
Of nothing in particular

You shut your mouth, how can you say
I go about things the wrong way?
I am human and I need to be loved
Just like everybody else does

I am the son and the heir
Of a shyness that was criminally vulgar
I am the son and heir
Of nothing in particular

You shut your mouth, how can you say
I go about things the wrong way?
I am human and I need to be loved
Just like everybody else does
There's a club, if you'd like to go
You could meet somebody who really loves you
So you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own
And you go home and you cry and you want to die

When you say "it's gonna happen now"
When exactly do you mean?
See I've already waited too long
And all my hope is gone

You shut your mouth, how can you say
I go about things the wrong way?
I am human and I need to be loved
Just like everybody else does

HUNGRY LIKE THE WOLF

Darken the city, night is a wire
Steam in the subway, earth is afire
Do do do do do do do dodo dododo dodo
Woman you want me, give me a sign
And catch my breathing even closer behind
Do do do do do do do dodo dododo dodo

In touch with the ground
I'm on the hunt, I'm after you
Smell like I sound, I'm lost in a crowd
And I'm hungry like the wolf
Straddle the line, in discord and rhyme
I'm on the hunt, I'm after you
Mouth is alive, with juices like wine
And I'm hungry like the wolf

Stalked in the forest, too close to hide
I'll be upon you by the moonlight side
Do do do do do do do dodo dododo dodo
High blood drumming on your skin, it's so tight
You feel my heat, I'm just a moment behind
Do do do do do do do dodo dododo dodo
In touch with the ground
I'm on the hunt, I'm after you
Scent and a sound
I'm lost and I'm found
And I'm hungry like the wolf
Strut on a line, it's discord and rhyme
I howl and I whine I'm after you
Mouth is alive, all running inside
And I'm hungry like the wolf

Hungry like the wolf
Hungry like the wolf
Hungry like the wolf

Burning the ground, I break from the crowd
I'm on the hunt,I'm after you
I smell like I sound
I'm lost and I'm found
And I'm hungry like the wolf
Strut on a line, it's discord and rhyme
I'm on the hunt I'm after you
Mouth is alive, with juices like wine
And I'm hungry like the wolf

WHERE DO BROKEN HEARTS GO

I know it's been some time
But there's something on my mind
You see
I haven't been the same
Since that cold November day
We said we needed space
But all we found was an empty place
And the only thing
I learned
Is that I need you desperately

So here I am
And can you please tell me

Where do broken hearts go?
Can they find their way home
Back to the open arms
Of a love that's waiting there?
And if somebody loves you
Won't they always love you?
I look in your eyes
And I know that you still care, for me
Ooh baby
I've been around enough to know
That dreams don't turn to gold
And that there is no easy way
No, you just can't run away
And what we have is so much more
Than we ever had before
And no matter how I try
You're always on my mind

So here I am
And can you please tell me

Where do broken hearts go?
Can they find their way home
Back to the open arms
Of a love that's waiting there?
And if somebody loves you
Won't they always love you?
I look in your eyes
And I know that you still care, for me

And now that I am here with you
I'll never let you go
I look into your eyes
And now I know, now I know
Where do broken hearts go?
Can they find their way home
Back to the open arms
Of a love that's waiting there?
And if somebody loves you
Won't they always love you?
I look in your eyes
And I know that you still care, for me

BACK TO LIFE

Don't Flop, Christmas Card
Who's ready for this next battle?
Make some noise!
We've got a very special one right now
It's a one-rounder, it was set up on five days prep
Cause unfortunately the er- who dropped out?
Juan - Juan dropped out
Well I mean it was supposed to be him  and Rob Wilson
Blah blah blah, but now it's a one rounder with Soljitsu so we're going to get into this right now!
OK!
On the left, we got Harry Baker, make some noise!
And on the right, we got Soljitsu
First round it's on Harry Baker we're gonna get right into this shit

Figured that it's Christmas right?
So I'd get started with that cracker shit
Was meant to team up with the league's best ginger rapper

Yeah, Cracker's shit
You're drier than a sandwich of sand with silica gel in-between crackers is
And just bring very little presence, bad jokes, and dodgy hats and this
Wait - very little presents? Bad jokes? Dodgy hats?
That's like a cracker, shit
 What dog doesn't bark?
A hot dog
Bars
They said how do you feel about battling Soul?
I was like whoa, big news
A title match, Harry Baker vs Soul, it's due
He'll lose that relatively new chain like they just sold Itsu
They said no, Soljitsu
Known for exposing dudes
I thought well, I better not wear any old, shit shoes
Cause you are more annoying than having to sneeze with no tissues
You are more annoying than karaoke with note issues
I didn't know whether to write bars or jokes for you so Baker brought the best of both like Hovis do
 Cause on the first day of the Christmas Card, Bamalam sent to me
Someone who doesn't prep properly for battles
And then on the second day of the Christmas Card, I couldn't help but see
He's got another battle
See when I got this with five days prep I thought, "Excellent - I'll try and set some time aside and put a little bit of effort in."
When you got this with five days prep he thought, "Excellent - I'll do another round about how I didn't prep for this."
Cause Michael White, HK, ain't worth the ink from your pen
But then Seventh Birthday, main stage, you did it again
The biggest battle of your life
Why should that be different unless
You were saving yourself for a last minute one-rounder at the Christmas event
Cause I watched Soljitsu vs 100 Bulletz
Here's what I know through this
Main stage battles are like Helena Bonham-Carter's lawyers settled at once with her partner
They don't sue Tim
And that is one of the differences with this blagger and me
How we've reacted to the chances that we've had in the league
Cause bullets shouldn't be a problem with a man from the street
But you got given the shot, and couldn't handle the heat
I've battled O'Shea, Pamflit, Matter
Making big steps with vets
You're just another newbie getting sunned
Like insects did sex
We've both been here a couple of years
10 battles or so it's blessed
But you are the worst opponent I have had to date
And I am his best
This is why this has got the feeling of an American card
This got confirmed, he was like, "Cor, vet!"
Cause he was like, "Cor, vet!" like an American car
I was like, "Che, rookie!", like an American car
Like an American car
See if you think we must hang like American cars
You rap like you can't afford focus
Like a camera enthusiast that wants to buy an expensive lens
Or an American car
Because - oh this is where it gets exciting
Cause I've forgotten what I'm writing
We all knew this
When you choke it's kinda whack bruv
When I choke, Quill promised that he'd have it as back up
Where is Quill?
There is Quill

And I was like hi though
You were joking
I'm that type of bloke
I can go to the bar
I can grab you some Cokes
That's a couple bars that you're having for Sol
Now you can carry on with the flow

Yeah

I rate that, I rate that, I rate that

You're basically a polished turd that never brings a polished third
Your first rounds are amazing
Your last rounds are terrible
Today that is the same thing so this could be incredible
But thank you for stepping in
Juan and Rob stay ducking
Cause they're next on the menu
Soljitsu stay ducking
When he enters the venue
Cause you can't fit through doorways properly
When you walk into newsagents you get accused of snobbery
Because you're looking down on their top shelf pornography
So I have no idea, if you're a real fucking skeng man
But you are the same height as Luol fucking Deng man
Soldier dips in and out of yolks like a boiled fucking egg man
And I was big on the slam poetry scene in Germany in 2014 like Julia fucking Engelmann
Google das
Yet still you wouldn't find a bigger plank in all of B&Q
I make the crowd screw face like they sort of need a poo
Leaving them awkwardly bemused is all you seem to do
So now I'm removing sole like orthapaedic shoes
Nah I'm removing Soul like punching Caustic forced the league to do
Removing sole like you've got - Removing sole like you've got served fish when you're a vegan dude
Removing soul like that moment you die your aura's leaving you
So they'll need to bring him Back to Life like Soul II Soul lyrics
Cause if Sol's ever been consistent then Sol's the sole witness
Even at his best I only fuck with some of Sol's disses
So he's still getting sunned at his peak like summer solstices
Cause you're from Redbridge
Redbridge
Known for its award winning parks and open spaces
Redbridge
Yet he walks around with that golden gait
That's a red bridge
You have the swagger of an incredibly awkward poet from Bristol called Tim Ledwitch
Shoutout Tim Ledwitch
And if you don't know who Tim Ledwitch is I just made that up to make my punchline sound edgy as shit
Nah he is real though
You called out Juan
Then battled Juan
Then called out Lethal Bizzle
He couldn't make it today
But he sent a poet from the streets of Bristol so
Pow! You don't know about me
Pow! I'm Harry to the B
Pow! It's fun to rhyme pars but in Leeds P Solja took away my hood and grime pass
And to finish
I now have a question about his erection
This is not something I say often
But when you get a boner do you call it The Rock?
Because that's another name for Dwayne's Johnson
Do you?
It doesn't matter if you do!

You know what
First of all
Fuck Danny Jaqq
He said that Frankie Phraser is a real fucking skeng man
He's not - he's a real fucking pen man
I'll say it again
Fuck - no I won't
Anyway
Harry Baker
Howdy neighbour
I watched your battle with O'Shea and I agree
Your nan's a Gary taker
Your dad is Danny Baker
And if you ran into Mark Grist you would form a pack of Quavers
He said that I swear
I wholeheartedly apologise for my last performance
I know it's a tad bit late
But they have given me Harry Baker
So I gotta say thanks to Bam today
Cause this has come as a massive favour
Seeing that our styles compliment each other like
Danny J vs Frankie Phraser
I took a leaf out of Pamflit's page
Just to say that I rap it greater
When I'm multi-ing Harry Baker with Harry Baker
Cause Harry Baker rhymes with Harry Baker
I'm gonna keep rhyming Harry Baker with Harry Baker
Until I remember what I actually wrote for Harry Baker
No, real shit
I won't get caught, no
I usually rap about how the grams of 'caine brang me major stacks of paper
Or I talk about guns
But in this crowd, guns shock, nigga that's a taser
For battles I usually prep the day before the battle day or actually later
But this-
But this time it was two days' prep
You can thank me later
Actual bakers need to make dough, to make dough
So they knead, to make dough, to make dough
With ease
This Baker makes dough with poetry
I make dough by growing trees
Not the smoking trees
That coca leaf
That makes the product with the potent seeds
To turn motherfuckers into overdosing fiends
I could do bars
I could do jokes
But I'm doing bad bars
Jokingly
Cause I know this league
They always want the goon bag to go- to put on the show with geeks
But I'm neither or because I chose my niche
Don't Flop made it cool for- nah sorry
Don't Flop made it cool for nerds to chat that shit
And talk that smack in a rapper's face
K-Shine has given the green light to not take that shit
By smacking a rapper's face
So stick to your poetry
Let me explain
You cross the line
You'll get smacked back to your lane
So fuck a poetry slam
That would get a poet beat, slammed
And Don't Flop ain't banning us
I could give you the left, or the right, they're both bangers
You could hit the gym, it won't matter
Cause when you wear a t-shirt
The t-shirt looks like it's still on the coat hanger
Yeah
Harry Baker
Howdy neighbour
Nah I'm joking
Just cause you wrote a book of puns doesn't mean you wrote the book of puns
No-one gives a shit what Baker's punning
Cause all the Don't Flop fans love my puns
Just Baker's doesn't
So you wanna play a game of puns?
You think mine is weak?
My pun game is Dr Jekyll in a turban
Nigga that's Hyde and Sikh!
Should I continue?
He'll probably break down the word continue
But that doesn't make you talented
That just shows that's the cunt in you
That's why I'm cunting you
Cause those schemes and Office bars
Are something stupid cunt teens use (Juan)
Yo
I'm not gonna fuck up again
Cause this is the event at the end
The old Soljitsu is dead
The one that doesn't prep
This is freestyle off the top of my head
And he said that, he meant that, I'm putting that to bed
And if you don't believe me, just remember, that's what I said
Cause that's what I meant
Cause that's what I wrote
Cause that's what I read
And no I didn't throw it away
That's what I kept
Merry Christmas

PANAMA

Ooh
Oh yeah
Uh-huh, ah!

Jump back, what's that sound?
Here she comes, full blast and top down
Hot shoe, burning down the avenue
Model citizen, zero discipline

Don't you know she's coming home to me?
You'll lose her in the turn
I'll get her, ah!

Panama
Panama
Panama
Panama

Ain't nothin' like it, her shiny machine
Got the feel for the wheel, keep the moving parts clean
Hot shoe, burning down the avenue
Out an on-ramp coming through my bedroom
Don't you know she's coming home to me?
You'll lose her in the turn
I'll get her, ah!
Uh-oh

Panama
Panama, ow
Panama, ah
Panama, oh-oh-oh-oh
Woo!


Ah
Yeah, we're running a little bit hot tonight
I can barely see the road from the heat coming off it, I say
I reach down between my legs and
Ease the seat back

She's blinding, I'm flying
Right behind in rearview mirror now
Got the fearing, power steering
Pistons popping, ain't no stopping now
Panama
Panama
Panama
Panama, oh-oh-oh-oh
Panama
Panama, oh-oh-oh-oh

Heaven is closer now today
The sound is in my ears
I can't believe the things you say
They echo what I fear
Twisting the bones until they snap
I scream but no one knows
You say I'm familiar, cold to touch
And then you turn and go
Feels like Heaven
Feels like Heaven
See how we planned for saddened eyes
And tears to pave the way
I fought the fever as I knew
My hair returned to gray
Study your face and fade the frame
Too close for comfort now
We can recall the harmony
That lingered but turned sour
Feels like Heaven
Feels like Heaven
You wanted all I had to give
See me, I feel, see me, I live
Oh oooo
Feels like Heaven (heaven is closer, heaven is closer)
Feels like Heaven (heaven is closer, heaven is closer)
Feels like Heaven (heaven is closer, heaven is closer)
Feels like Heaven (heaven is closer, heaven is closer)
Feels like Hea-ven (heaven is closer, heaven is closer)

FREE FALLIN'

She's a good girl, loves her mama
Loves Jesus and America too
She's a good girl, crazy 'bout Elvis
Loves horses and her boyfriend too
It's a long day, livin' in Reseda
There's a freeway, runnin' through the yard
And I'm a bad boy, 'cause I don't even miss her
I'm a bad boy for breakin' her heart

And I'm free, free fallin'
Yeah I'm free, free fallin'

All the vampires, walkin' through the valley
Move west down Ventura Boulevard
And all the bad boys are standing in the shadows
And the good girls are home with broken hearts

And I'm free, I'm free fallin'
Yeah I'm free, free fallin'
(Free fallin', I'm-a free fallin', I'm-a
Free fallin', I'm-a free fallin', I'm-a)
I wanna glide down over Mulholland
I wanna write her name in the sky
I'm gonna free fall out into nothin'
Gonna leave this world for a while

Now I'm free, free fallin'

STRANGELOVE

There'll be times when my crimes
Will seem almost unforgivable
I give in to sin
Because you have to make this life livable

But when you think I've had enough from your sea of love
I'll take more than another riverful
Yes, and I'll make it all worthwhile
I'll make your heart smile

Strangelove, strange highs and strange lows
Strangelove, that's how my love goes
Strangelove, will you give it to me?

Will you take the pain I will give to you
Again and again and will you return it?

There'll be days when I'll stray
I may appear to be constantly out of reach
I give in to sin
Because I like to practice what I preach
I'm not trying to say I'll have it all my way
I'm always willing to learn when you've got something to teach
Oh, and I'll make it all worthwhile
I'll make your heart smile

Pain, will you return it?
I'll say it again: pain
Pain, will you return it?
I'll say it again: pain
Pain, will you return it?
I'll say it again: pain
Pain, will you return it?
I won't say it again

Strangelove, strange highs and strange lows
Strangelove, that's how my love goes
Strangelove, will you give it to me?
Strangelove, strange highs and strange lows
Strangelove, that's how my love goes
Strangelove, will you give it to me?
Strangelove, strange highs and strange lows
Strangelove, that's how my love goes
Strangelove, will you give it to me?
I give in
Again and again
I give in
Will you give it to me?
I give in
I'll say it again
I give in
I give in
Again and again
I give in
That's how my love goes
I give in
I'll say it again
I give in

SAVING ALL MY LOVE FOR YOU

A few stolen moments, is all that we shared
You've got your family, and they need you there
Though I try to resist, being last on your list
But no other man's gonna do
So I'm saving all my love for you

It's not very easy living all alone
My friends try and tell me find a man of my own
But each time I try, I just break down and cry
'Cause I'd rather be home feeling blue
So I'm saving all my love for you

You used to tell me we'd run away together
Love gives you the right to be free
You said, "Be patient, just wait a little longer."
But that's just an old fantasy

I've got to get ready
Just a few minutes more
Gonna get that old feeling
When you walk through that door
'Cause tonight is the night for a feeling alright
We'll be making love the whole night through
So I'm saving all my love
Yes, I'm saving all my love
Yes, I'm saving all my love for you
No other woman is gonna love you more
'Cause tonight is the night that I'm feeling alright
We'll be making love the whole night through
So I'm saving all my love
Yeah, I'm saving all my loving
Yes, I'm saving all my love for you
For you, for you

END OF THE LINE

Well it's all right, riding around in the breeze
Well it's all right, if you live the life you please
Well it's all right, doing the best you can
Well it's all right, as long as you lend a hand

You can sit around and wait for the phone to ring
Waiting for someone to tell you everything
Sit around and wonder what tomorrow will bring
Maybe a diamond ring

Well it's all right, even if they say you're wrong
Well it's all right, sometimes you gotta be strong
Well it's all right, as long as you got somewhere to lay
Well it's all right, everyday is Judgement Day

Maybe somewhere down the road away
You'll think of me, and wonder where I am these days
Maybe somewhere down the road when somebody plays
Purple haze
Well it's all right, even when push comes to shove
Well it's all right, if you got someone to love
Well it's all right, everything'll work out fine
Well it's all right, we're going to the end of the line
Don't have to be ashamed of the car I drive
I'm just glad to be here, happy to be alive
It don't matter if you're by my side
I'm satisfied

Well it's all right, even if you're old and grey
Well it's all right, you still got something to say
Well it's all right, remember to live and let live
Well it's all right, the best you can do is forgive
Well it's all right, riding around in the breeze
Well it's all right, if you live the life you please
Well it's all right, even if the sun don't shine
Well it's all right, we're going to the end of the line

COLD AS ICE

You're as cold as ice
You're willing to sacrifice our love
You never take advice
Some day, you'll pay the price
I know

I've seen it before, it happens all the time (Ooh-ooh)
You're closing the door, you leave the world behind
You're digging for gold, you're throwing away (Ah, ah)
A fortune in feelings but, some day, you'll pay

You're as cold as ice
You're willing to sacrifice our love
You want paradise
But some day, you'll pay the price
I know

I've seen it before, it happens all the time (Ooh-ooh)
You're closing the door, you leave the world behind
You're digging for gold, you're throwing away (Ah, ah)
A fortune in feelings but, some day, you'll pay
Cold as ice
You know that you are
Cold as ice
As cold as ice to me
Cold as ice

Ooh, ooh, ooh, cold as, cold as ice
You're as cold as ice
You're as cold as ice, cold as ice, I know
You're as cold as ice, yes I know
You're as cold as ice, cold as ice, I know
You're as cold as ice, oh, yes I know
You're as cold as ice, cold as ice, I know
You're as cold as ice, oh, yes I know
You're as cold as ice, cold as ice

THAT'S ALL

{Intro}
Just as I thought, it was going alright
I found out I'm wrong, when I thought I was right
It's always the same, it's just a shame, that's all
I could say day, and you'd say night
Tell me it's black, when I know that it's white
Always the same, it's just a shame, and that's all
I could leave, but I won't go
Though my heart might tell me so
I can't feel a thing from my head down to my toes
But why does it always seem to be
Me looking at you, you looking at me
It's always the same, it's just a shame, that's all
Turning me on, turning me off
Making me feel like I want too much
Living with you is just putting me through it all of the time
Running around, staying out all night
Taking it all instead of taking one bite
Living with you is just putting me through it all of the time
I could leave, but I won't go
But it'd be easier I know
I can't feel a thing from my head down to my toes
But why does it always seem to be
Me looking at you, you looking at me
It's always the same, it's just a shame, that's all
Truth is I love you, more than I wanted to
There's no point in trying to pretend
There's been no one who makes me feel like you do
Say we'll be together 'til the end
{Bridge}
I could leave but I won't go
It would be easier, I know
I can't feel a thing from my head down to my toes
So why does it always seem to be
Me looking at you, you looking at me
It's always the same, it's just a shame, that's all
But I love you, more than I wanted to
There's no point in trying to pretend
There's been no one who makes me feel like you do
Say we'll be together' til the end
But just as I thought it was going alright
I found out I'm wrong when I thought I was right
It's always the same, it's just a shame, that's all
Well I could say day, and you'd say night
You tell me it's black when I know that it's white
It's always the same, it's just a shame, that's all
That's all

TAINTED LOVE

Sometimes I feel I've got to
Run away I've got to
Get away
From the pain you drive into the heart of me
The love we share
Seems to go nowhere
And I've lost my light
For I toss and turn I can't sleep at night

Once I ran to you (I ran)
Now, I'll run from you
This tainted love you've given
I give you all a boy could give you
Take my tears and that's not nearly all
Oh, tainted love
Tainted love

Now, I know I've got to
Run away, I've got to
Get away
You don't really want any more from me
To make things right
You need someone to hold you tight
And you think love is to pray
But I'm sorry, I don't pray that way
Once I ran to you (I ran)
Now, I'll run from you
This tainted love you've given
I give you all a boy could give you
Take my tears and that's not nearly all
Oh, tainted love
Tainted love

Don't touch me please
I cannot stand the way you tease
I love you, though you hurt me so
Now, I'm gonna pack my things and go
Tainted love, oh, tainted love, oh
Tainted love, oh, tainted love, oh
Touch me, baby, tainted love
Touch me, baby, tainted love
Tainted love, oh
Tainted love, oh
Tainted love

FAST CAR

You got a fast car
I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Starting from zero, got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me, myself, I got nothing to prove

You got a fast car
I got a plan to get us outta here
I been working at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just 'cross the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
Finally see what it means to be living

See, my old man's got a problem
He lives with a bottle, that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for working
His body's too young to look like his
When momma went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said "Somebody's gotta take care of him"
So I quit school, and that's what I did
You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision
Leave tonight, or live and die this way

So I remember when we were driving
Driving in your car
Speed so fast it felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arms felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I-I had a feeling that I belonged
I-I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

You got a fast car
We go cruising, entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
And I work in a market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs

So I remember when we were driving
Driving in your car
Speed so fast it felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arms felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I-I had a feeling that I belonged
I-I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone
You got a fast car
I got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinkin' late at the bar
See more of your friends than you do your kids
I'd always hoped for better
Thought maybe together you and me'd find it
I got no plans, I ain't going nowhere
So take your fast car and keep on driving

So remember when we were driving
Driving in your car
Speed so fast it felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I-I had a feeling that I belonged
I-I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so you can fly away?
You gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way

AFRICA

I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
Her moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say
"Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you"

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside
Frightened of this thing that I've become
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had
Hurry boy, she's waiting there for you

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

CAN'T FIGHT THIS FEELING

Oh, I can't fight this feeling any longer
And yet, I'm still afraid to let it flow
What started out as friendship, has grown stronger
I only wish I had the strength to let it show
I tell myself that I can't hold out forever
I said there is no reason for my fear
'Cause I feel so secure when we're together
You give my life direction
You make everything so clear

And even as I wander, I'm keeping you in sight
You're a candle in the window on a cold, dark winter's night
And I'm getting closer than I ever thought I might

And I can't fight this feeling anymore
I've forgotten what I started fighting for
It's time to bring this ship into the shore
And throw away the oars, forever
Cause I can't fight this feeling anymore
I've forgotten what I started fighting for
And if I have to crawl upon the floor
Come crashing through your door
Baby, I can't fight this feeling anymore
My life has been such a whirlwind since I saw you
I've been running round in circles in my mind
And it always seems that I'm following you, girl
'Cause you take me to the places that, alone, I'd never find

And even as I wander, I'm keeping you in sight
You're a candle in the window on a cold, dark winter's night
And I'm getting closer than I ever thought I might

And I can't fight this feeling anymore
I've forgotten what I started fighting for
It's time to bring this ship into the shore
And throw away the oars, forever
Cause I can't fight this feeling anymore
I've forgotten what I started fighting for
And if I have to crawl upon the floor
Come crashing through your door
Baby, I can't fight this feeling anymore

RUNNING UP THAT HILL

It doesn't hurt me
You want to feel how it feels
You want to know, know that it doesn't hurt me
You want to hear about the deal that I'm making

You
You and me

And if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
I'd get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
Be running up that building
If I only could, oh...

You don't want to hurt me
But see how deep the bullet lies
Unaware I'm tearing you asunder
Ooh, there is thunder in our hearts, baby
Is there so much hate for the ones we love?
Tell me, we both matter, don't we?
You
You and me, won't be unhappy

And if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
I'd get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
Be running up that building
If I only could, oh...

Come on, baby
Come on, come on, darling
Let me steal this moment from you now
Come on, angel
Come on, come on, darling
Let's exchange the experience, oh

And if I only could
Make a deal with God
I'd get him to swap our places
I'd be running up that road
Be running up that hill
Be running up that building
If I only could, oh

BOYS DON'T CRY

I would say I'm sorry
If I thought that it would change your mind
But I know that this time
I have said too much, been too unkind

I tried to laugh about it
Cover it all up with lies
I tried to laugh about it
Hiding the tears in my eyes
'Cause boys don't cry
Boys don't cry

I would break down at your feet
And beg forgiveness, plead with you
But I know that it's too late
And now there's nothing I can do

So I try to laugh about it
Cover it all up with lies
I try to laugh about it
Hiding the tears in my eyes
'Cause boys don't cry
Boys don't cry
I would tell you that I loved you
If I thought that you would stay
But I know that it's no use
And you've already gone away

Misjudged your limits
Pushed you too far
Took you for granted
I thought that you needed me more, more, more

Now I would do 'most anything
To get you back by my side
But I just keep on laughing
Hiding the tears in my eyes
'Cause boys don't cry
Boys don't cry

Boys don't cry

I GUESS THAT'S WHY THEY CALL IT THE BLUES

Don't wish it away
Don't look at it like it's forever
Between you and me, I could honestly say
That things can only get better

And while I'm away
Dust out the demons inside
And it won't be long before you and me run
To the place in our hearts where we hide

And I guess that's why they call it the blues
Time on my hands could be time spent with you
Laughin' like children, livin' like lovers
Rollin' like thunder under the covers
And I guess that's why they call it the blues

Just stare into space
Picture my face in your hands
Live for each second without hesitation
And never forget I'm your man

Wait on me, girl
Cry in the night if it helps
But more than ever, I simply love you
More than I love life itself
And I guess that's why they call it the blues
Time on my hands could be time spent with you
Laughin' like children, livin' like lovers
Rollin' like thunder under the covers
And I guess that's why they call it the blues


Wait on me, girl

Lovely is the feelin' now
Fever, temperatures risin' now
Power is the force, the vow (Oh power)
That makes it happen, it asks no questions why (Ooh)
So get closer (Closer now)
To my body now
Just love me
'Till you don't know how (Ooh)

Keep on with the force, don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force, don't stop

KISS

You don't have to be beautiful to turn me on
I just need your body, baby, from dusk 'til dawn
You don't need experience to turn me out
You just leave it all up to me, I'm gonna show you what it's all about
You don't have to be rich to be my girl
You don't have to be cool to rule my world
Ain't no particular sign I'm more compatible with
I just want your extra time and your kiss

You got to not talk dirty, baby, if you wanna impress me
You can't be too flirty, mama, I know how to undress me
I want to be your fantasy, maybe you could be mine
You just leave it all up to me, we could have a good time

You don't have to be rich to be my girl
You don't have to be cool to rule my world
Ain't no particular sign I'm more compatible with
I just want your extra time and your kiss

Yes, oh, I think I wanna dance, uh
Gotta, gotta, oh
Little Girl Wendy's Parade
Gotta, gotta, gotta
Women, not girls, rule my world, I said they rule my world
Act your age, mama, not your shoe size, maybe we could do the twirl
You don't have to watch "Dynasty" to have an attitude
You just leave it all up to me, my love will be your food

You don't have to be rich to be my girl
You don't have to be cool to rule my world
Ain't no particular sign I'm compatible with!
I just want your extra time and your kiss

I WON'T LET THE SUN GO DOWN ON ME

Forty winks in the lobby, make mine a G&T
Then to our favorite hobby, searching for an enemy
Here in our paper houses, stretching for miles and miles
Old men in stripy trousers rule the world with plastic smiles
Good or bad, like it or not
It's the only one we've got

I won't let the sun go down on me
I won't let the sun go down
I won't let the sun go down on me
I won't let the sun go down

Mother nature isn't in it, three hundred million years
Goodbye in just a minute, gone forever, no more tears
Pinball man, power glutton, vacuum inside his head
Forefinger on the button, is he blue or is he red
Break your silence if you would
Before the sun goes down for good

I won't let the sun go down on me
I won't let the sun go down
I won't let the sun go down on me
I won't let the sun go down
I won't let the sun go down on me
I won't let the sun go down
I won't let the sun go down on me
I won't let the sun go down
I won't let the sun go down on me
I won't let the sun go down
I won't let the sun go down on me
I won't let the sun go down
I won't let the sun go down on me
I won't let the sun go down
I won't let the sun go down

HARD TO SAY I'M SORRY

"Everybody needs a little time away"
I heard her say, from each other
Even lovers need a holiday
Far away, from each other

Hold me now
It's hard for me to say I'm sorry
I just want you to stay

After all that we've been through
I will make it up to you, I promise to
And after all that's been said and done
You're just the part of me I can't let go

Couldn't stand to be kept away
Just for the day, from your body
Wouldn't want to be swept away
Far away, from the one that I love

Hold me now
It's hard for me to say I'm sorry
I just want you to know
Hold me now
I really want to tell you I'm sorry
I could never let you go
After all that we've been through
I will make it up to you, I promise to
And after all that's been said and done
You're just the part of me I can't let go
After all that we've been through
I will make it up to you, I promise to
You're going to be the lucky one

When we get there gonna jump in the air
No one'll see us cause there's nobody there
After all, you know we really don't care
Hold on, I'm gonna take you there

CLUB TROPICANA

Let me take you to the place
Where membership's a smiling face
Brush shoulders with the stars
Where strangers take you by the hand
And welcome you to wonderland
From beneath their panamas

All that's missing is the sea
But don't worry, you can suntan

Cocktail time, a summer's tune
A whole night's holiday

EVERY LITTLE THING SHE DOES IS MAGIC

Though I've tried before to tell her
Of the feelings I have for her in my heart
Every time that I come near her
I just lose my nerve as I've done from the start

Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she does just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on

Do I have to tell the story
Of a thousand rainy days since we first met
It's a big enough umbrella
But it's always me
That ends up getting wet

Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she does just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on

I resolved to call her up
A thousand times a day
And ask her if she'll marry me
In some old fashioned way
But my silent fears have gripped me
Long before I reach the phone
Long before my tongue has tripped me
Must I always be alone?
Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she does just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on

Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she does just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on

Every little thing, every little thing
Every, every little thing
Every little, every little, every little
Every little thing she does
Every little thing she does
Every little thing she does
Every little thing she does
That she does is magic
Eee oh oh, eee oh oh
Eee oh oh, eee oh oh
Eee oh oh, eee oh oh
Eee oh oh, eee oh oh
Eee oh oh, eee oh oh
Eee oh oh, eee oh oh
Eee oh oh, eee oh oh
Eee oh oh, eee oh oh
Every little thing
Every little thing
Every little thing
She does is magic, magic, magic
Magic, magic, magic
Ey oh, yo oh
Eee oh oh oh oh oh
Do I have to tell the story
Of a thousand rainy days since we first met
It's a big enough umbrella
But it's always me
That ends up getting wet

SOMETHING ABOUT YOU

How, how can it be that a love
Carved out of caring, fashioned by fate
Could suffer so hard
From the games played once too often?
But making mistakes
Is a part of life's imperfections
Born of the years
Is it so wrong to be human after all?

Drawn into the stream
Of undefined illusion
Those diamond dreams
They can't disguise the truth

That there is something about you
Baby so right
I wouldn't be without you baby tonight

If ever our love was concealed
No one can say that we didn't feel
A million things
And a perfect dream of life
Gone, fragile but free
We remain tender together
If not so in love
It's not so wrong
We're only human after all
These changing years
They add to your confusion
Oh and you need to hear
The time that told the truth

Because there's something about you
Baby so right
I couldn't be without you
Baby tonight
I know there's something about you
Baby
And I couldn't live without you
Tonight

RADIO GA GA

(Radio)
(Radio)

I'd sit alone and watch your light
My only friend through teenage nights
And everything I had to know
I heard it on my radio
You gave them all those old time stars
Through wars of worlds invaded by Mars
You made 'em laugh, you made 'em cry
You made us feel like we could fly (Radio)
So don't become some background noise
A backdrop for the girls and boys
Who just don't know or just don't care
And just complain when you're not there

You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
Radio (Radio)

All we hear is radio ga ga
Radio goo goo, radio ga ga
All we hear is radio ga ga
Radio blah blah
Radio, what's new?
Radio, someone still loves you
We watch the shows, we watch the stars
On videos for hours and hours
We hardly need to use our ears
How music changes through the years
Let's hope you never leave, old friend
Like all good things, on you we depend
So stick around 'cause we might miss you
When we grow tired of all this visual
You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
Radio (Radio)

All we hear is radio ga ga
Radio goo goo, radio ga ga
All we hear is radio ga ga
Radio goo goo, radio ga ga
All we hear is radio ga ga
Radio blah blah
Radio, what's new?
Someone still loves you!

(Radio ga ga, radio ga ga)

You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour

SWEET LITTLE MYSTERY

Baby, baby, baby
Baby
Just you and me
Tell me baby
My love has taken a tumble
Ooh

You're such a natural

Say I wouldn't steer you wrong now

It's just that sweet little mystery that makes me try
Try, try, try
That makes me try
It's just that sweet little mystery that makes me try
Try, try, try

Didn't I come
Insisting a side of wonder
Didn't I come
Resting a higher decision
Didn't I come
Insisting a side of wonder to your life?
Say I wouldn't steer you wrong now
Baby
I wouldn't steer you wrong
It's just that sweet little mystery that makes me try
Try, try, try

Don't think it is tragic
Hey-hey-hey
Just think of the magic
Come on listen:
My love has taken a tumble
My love has taken a tumble
Come on listen:

But I'm still standing
If you had only, only, only ...
Love me like you use to do
Just that sweet little mystery that makes me try

Try, try, try
Try, try, try
Try, try, try
Com'on, com'on, com'on
My love has taken a tumble
My love has taken a tumble

WHEN DOVES CRY

Dig, if you will, the picture
Of you and I engaged in a kiss
The sweat of your body covers me
Can you, my darling?
Can you picture this?

Dream, if you can, a courtyard
An ocean of violets in bloom
Animals strike curious poses
They feel the heat
The heat between me and you

How can you just leave me standing
Alone in a world that's so cold?
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father: too bold
Maybe you're just like my mother
She's never satisfied
Why do we scream at each other?
This is what it sounds like
When doves cry
Touch, if you will, my stomach
Feel how it trembles inside
You've got the butterflies all tied up
Don't make me chase you
Even doves have pride
How can you just leave me standing
Alone in a world so cold?
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father: too bold
Maybe you're just like my mother
She's never satisfied
Why do we scream at each other?
This is what it sounds like
When doves cry
How can you just leave me standing
Alone in a world that's so cold?
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father: too bold
Maybe you're just like my mother
She's never satisfied
Why do we scream at each other?
This is what it sounds like
When doves cry

When doves cry (when doves cry)
When doves cry (when doves cry)
When doves cry
When doves cry
When doves cry
When doves cry, don't cry
Darling, don't cry
Don't cry, don't cry, don't, don't cry
