TORN

I thought I saw a man brought to life
He was warm, he came around like he was dignified
He showed me what it was to cry
Well, you couldn't be that man I adored
You don't seem to know, or seem to care what your heart is for
But I don't know him anymore

There's nothing where he used to lie
My conversation has run dry
That's what's going on
Nothing's fine, I'm torn

I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I am shamed
Lying naked on the floor
Illusion never changed
Into something real
I'm wide awake and I can see
The perfect sky is torn
You're a little late
I'm already torn
So I guess the fortune teller's right
Should've seen just what was there
And not some holy light
But you crawled beneath my veins, and now

I don't care, I had no luck
I don't miss it all that much
There's just so many things
That I can touch, I'm torn

I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I am shamed
Lying naked on the floor
Illusion never changed
Into something real
I'm wide awake and I can see
The perfect sky is torn
You're a little late, I'm already torn
Torn
(Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)

There's nothing where he used to lie
My inspiration has run dry
That's what's going on
Nothing's right, I'm torn
I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I am shamed
Lying naked on the floor
Illusion never changed
Into something real
I'm wide awake and I can see
The perfect sky is torn

I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I'm ashamed
Bound and broken on the floor
You're a little late, I'm already torn
Torn
Oh

(Ooh yeah, a little)
(Ooh yeah, a little)
(Ooh yeah, a little)

WHAT'S UP?

25 years and my life is still
Tryin' to get up that great big hill of hope
For a destination
I realized quickly when I knew I should
That the world was made up of this brotherhood of man
For whatever that means

And so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
Just to get it all out what's in my head
And I, I am feeling a little peculiar
And so I wake in the morning and I step outside
And I take a deep breath and I get real high
And I scream from the top of my lungs
"What's going on?"

And I say, hey-ey-ey
Hey-ey-ey
I said "Hey, a-what's going on?"
And I say, hey-ey-ey
Hey-ey-ey
I said "Hey, a-what's going on?"

Ooh, ooh
Ooh
Ooh, uh huh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh
Ooh, uh huh
And I try
Oh my God, do I try
I try all the time
In this institution
And I pray
Oh my God, do I pray
I pray every single day
For revolution

And so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
Just to get it all out, what's in my head
And I, I am feeling a little peculiar
And so I wake in the morning and I step outside
And I take a deep breath and I get real high
And I scream from the top of my lungs
"What's going on?"

And I say, hey-ey-ey
Hey-ey-ey
I said "Hey, what's going on?"
And I say, hey-ey-ey
Hey-ey-ey
I said "Hey, a-what's going on?"
And I say, hey-ey-ey
(Wake in the morning and step outside)
Hey-ey-ey
(Take a deep breath and I get real high)
(And I scream)
I said "Hey, a-what's going on?"
And I say, hey-ey-ey
(Wake in the morning and step outside)
Hey-ey, yeah yeah yeah
(Take a deep breath and I get real high)
(And I scream)
I said "Hey, a-what's going on?"
Ooh, ooh
Ooh
Ooh, uh huh

25 years and my life is still
Tryin' to get up that great big hill of hope
For a destination, mmm

I got my first real six string
Bought it at the five and dime
Played it til my fingers bled
Was the summer of '69

Me and some guys from school
Had a band and we tried real hard
Jimmy quit and Jody got married
I shoulda known we'd never get far

But when I look back now
That summer seemed to last forever
And if I had the choice
Ya, I'd always wanna be there
Those were the best days of my life

Ain't no use in complainin'
When you got a job to do
Spent my evenin's down at the drive-in
And that's when I met you, ya

Standin' on your mama's porch
You told me that you'd wait forever
Oh, and when you held my hand
I knew that it was now or never
Those were the best days of my life
Oh Yeah!
Back in the summer of '69
Oh!
Man, we were killin' time
We were young and restless
We needed to unwind
I guess nothin' can last forever
Forever, no...

Yeah!

And now the times are changin'
Look at everything that's come and gone
Sometimes when I play that old six string
I think about ya 'n wonder what went wrong

Standin' on your mama's porch
You told me it would last forever
Oh, the way you held my hand
I knew that it was now or never
Those were the best days of my life

Oh yeah
Back in the summer of '69
Uh-huh
It was the summer of '69
Oh yeah
Me and my baby in a 69
Oh! Oh!
It was the summer, summer, summer of 69

WONDERWALL

Today is gonna be the day that they're gonna throw it back to you
By now, you shoulda somehow realised what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now

Backbeat, the word is on the street that the fire in your heart is out
I'm sure you've heard it all before, but you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now

And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
But I don't know how

Because maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall

Today was gonna be the day, but they'll never throw it back to you
By now, you should've somehow realised what you're not to do
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now
And all the roads that lead you there were winding
And all the lights that light the way are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
But I don't know how

I said maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall
I said maybe (I said maybe)
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall
I said maybe (I said maybe)
You're gonna be the one that saves me (Saves me)
You're gonna be the one that saves me (Saves me)
You're gonna be the one that saves me (Saves me)

I WANT IT THAT WAY

Yeah-eh-eh

You are my fire
The one desire
Believe when I say
I want it that way
But we are two worlds apart
Can't reach to your heart
When you say
That I want it that way

Tell me why
Ain't nothing but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothing but a mistake
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say
I want it that way

Am I your fire?
Your one desire
Yes, I know it's too late
But I want it that way
Tell me why
Ain't nothing but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothing but a mistake
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say
I want it that way

Now I can see that we're falling apart
From the way that it used to be, yeah
No matter the distance
I want you to know
That deep down inside of me

You are my fire
The one desire
You are (you are, you are, you are)

Don't wanna hear you say
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
(Don't wanna hear you say)
I never wanna hear you say (oh, yeah)
I want it that way
Tell me why
Ain't nothing but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothing but a mistake
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say (don't wanna hear you say)
I want it that way
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say (never wanna hear you say, yeah)
I want it that way
'Cause I want it that way

WEAK

I don't know what it is that you've done to me
But it's caused me to act in such a crazy way
Whatever it is that you do when you do what you're doing
It's a feeling that I want to stay

'Cause my heart starts beating triple time
With thoughts of loving you on my mind
I can't figure out just what to do
When the problem here is you

I get so weak in the knees, I can hardly speak (I lose)
I lose all control and something takes over me (Control, takes over me)
In a daze and it's so amazing (Amaze)
It's not a phase (It's not), I want you to stay with me (Stay with me)
By my side, I swallow my pride (My pride)
Your love is so sweet
It knocks me right off of my feet
Can't explain why your lovin' makes me weak

Time after time, after time I try to fight it
But your love is strong, it keeps on holding on
Resistance is down
When you're around, cries fading
In my condition, I don't want to be alone
'Cause my heart starts beating triple time
With thoughts of loving you on my mind
I can't figure out just what to do
When the problem here is you, ohh

I get so weak in the knees, I can hardly speak (I lose)
I lose all control and something takes over me (Control, takes over me)
In a daze and it's so amazing (Amaze)
It's not a phase (It's not), I want you to stay with me (Stay with me)
By my side, I swallow my pride (My pride)
Your love is so sweet
It knocks me right off of my feet
Can't explain why your lovin' makes me weak

I try hard to fight it
No way can I deny it
Your love's so sweet
Knocks me off my feet

I get so weak in the knees, I can hardly speak (I lose)
I lose all control and something takes over me (Control, takes over me)
In a daze and it's so amazing (Amaze)
It's not a phase (It's not), I want you to stay with me (Stay with me)
By my side, I swallow my pride (My pride)
Your love is so sweet
It knocks me right off of my feet
Can't explain why your lovin' makes me weak
(I get so weak)
Blood starts racing through my veins
(I get so weak)
Boy, it's something I can't explain
(I get so weak)
Something 'bout the way you do
The things you do-ooo-ooo, it
(Knocks me right off of my feet)
Ohh, off my feet, I...
Can't explain why your lovin' makes me weak

I get so weak in the knees, I can hardly speak (I lose)
I lose all control and something takes over me (Control, takes over me)
In a daze and it's so amazing (Amazing)
It's not a phase (It's not), I want you to stay with me (Stay with me)
By my side, I swallow my pride (My pride)
Your love is so sweet
It knocks me right off of my feet (Ohh, I)
Can't explain why your lovin' makes me weak

SANTERIA

I don't practice Santeria, I ain't got no crystal ball
Well, I had a million dollars, but I'd, I'd spend it all
If I could find that jaina and that Sancho that she's found
Well, I'd pop a cap in sancho and I'd slap her down

What I really wanna know, ah, baby, mmm
What I really want to say, I can't define
Well, it's love that I need, oh
My soul will have to

Wait 'til I get back, find a jaina of my own
Daddy's gonna love one and all
I feel the break, feel the break, feel the break and I got' live it up
Oh yeah, huh, well, I swear that

What I really wanna know, ah, baby
What I really want to say, I can't define
Got love, make it go
My soul will have to

Mmm, what I really wanna say, ah, baby
What I really wanna say is, "I've got mine
And I'll make it, yes, I'm comin' up"
Tell Sanchito that

If he knows what is good for him, he best go run and hide
Daddy's got a new .45
And I won't think twice to stick that barrel straight down Sancho's throat
Believe me when I say that I got something for his punk ass

What I really wanna know, my baby
Ooh, what I really wanna say is, "there's just one"
Way back, and I'll make it, yeah
My soul will have to wait

Yeah, yeah, yeah

SANTA MONICA

I am still living with your ghost
Lonely and dreaming of the west coast
I don't want to be your downtime
I don't want to be your stupid game

With my big black boots and an old suitcase
I do believe I'll find myself a new place
I don't want to be the bad guy
I don't want do your sleepwalk dance anymore
I just want to see some palm trees
I will try and shake away this disease

We could live beside the ocean
Leave the fire behind
Swim out past the breakers
Watch the world die
We could live beside the ocean
Leave the fire behind
Swim out past the breakers
Watch the world die

I am still dreaming of your face
Hungry and hollow for all the things you took away
I don't want to be your good time
I don't want to be your fall-back crutch anymore
I'll walk right out into a brand new day
Insane and rising in my own weird way
I don't want to be the bad guy
I don't want to do your sleepwalk dance anymore
I just want to feel some sunshine
I just want to find some place to be alone

We could live beside the ocean
Leave the fire behind
Swim out past the breakers
Watch the world die
***************

ON & ON

Oh my, my, my, I'm feeling high
My money's gone, I'm all alone
Too much to see
The world keeps turning
Oh what a day, what a day, what a day
Peace and blessings manifest with every lesson learned
If your knowledge were your wealth, then it would be well-earned
If we were made in his image, then call us by our names
Most intellects do not believe in God but they fear us just the same

Oh, on and on and on and on
My cypher keeps moving like a rolling stone
Oh, on and on and on and on
All night 'til the break of dawn
I go on and on and on and on
My cypher keeps moving like a rolling stone
Oh on and on and on and on
Goddammit, I'ma sing my song

I was born under water
With three dollars and six dimes
Yeah, you might laugh
'Cause you did not do your math
Like one, two, three
(Damn, y'all feel that? Oh)
Like one, two, three
The world keeps turning
Oh what a day, what a day, what a day
The man that knows something knows that he knows nothing at all
Does it seem colder in your summertime and hotter in your fall?
If we were made in his image, then call us by our names
Most intellects do not believe in God but they fear us just the same
Oh on and on and on and on
My cypher keeps moving like a rolling stone
On and on and on and on
All night till the vultures swarm
I go on and on and on and on
My cypher keeps moving like a rolling stone
On and on and on and on
Mad props to the God JaBorn

I am feeling kinda hungry 'cause my high is coming down
Don't feed me yours 'cause your food does not endure
I think I need a cup of tea, the world keeps burning
Oh what a day, what a day, what a day
You rush into destruction 'cause you don't have nothing left
The mothership can't save you so your ass is gon' get left
If we were made in his image, then call us by our names
Most intellects do not believe in God but they fear us just the same

Oh on and on and on and on
My cypher keeps moving like a rolling stone
Oh on and on and on, on, on-on, on, on
You can't fuck with me, so just leave it alone
Ooh, ooh, wait, on and on and on and on
My cypher keeps moving like a rolling stone
Oh on and on and on and on
And on and on

CAN I KICK IT?

Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)

Well, I'm gone (Go on then!)

Can I kick it? To all the people who can Quest like A Tribe does
Before this, did you really know what live was?
Comprehend to the track, for it's why cuz
Gettin measures on the tip of the vibers
Rock and roll to the beat of the funk fuzz
Wipe your feet really good on the rhythm rug
If you feel the urge to freak, do the jitterbug
Come and spread your arms if you really need a hug
Afrocentric living is a big shrug
A life filled with fun that's what I love
A lower plateau is what we're above
If you diss us, we won't even think of
Will Nipper the doggy give a big shove?
This rhythm really fits like a snug glove
Like a box of positives it's a plus, love
As the Tribe flies high like a dove
(Can I kick it?)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)

Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Well, I'm gone (Go on then!)

Can I kick it? To my Tribe that flows in layers
Right now, Phife is a poem sayer
At times, I'm a studio conveyor
Mr. Dinkins, would you please be my mayor?
You'll be doing us a really big favor
Boy this track really has a lot of flavor
When it comes to rhythms, Quest is your savior
Follow us for the funky behavior
Make a note on the rhythm we gave ya
Feel free, drop your pants, check your ha-ir
Do you like the garments that we wear?
I instruct you to be the obeyer
A rhythm recipe that you'll savor
Doesn't matter if you're minor or major
Yes, the Tribe of the game we're the player
As you inhale like a breath of fresh air
(Can I kick it?)

TUAMIE has developed a new hyperbolic time chamber
Here on Namek, we'll be focusing on the mental
Training starts now, begin

Ooh, I've just been fanning myself, I'm a such a fan of myself
There's levels to the cool like a fan on a shelf
When you blow, they try to gas you like fans at the Shell station
God hands me a full plate, but I handle it well
If they don't feel your thoughts, start dreamin' in braille
They'll try to sell you short 'cause their dreams are for sale
They'll say "Get off your podium, life isn't Nickelodeon"
"Orange you so dumb?" Kenan and Kel, wow
The government leaves an animal trail
So I switch to swiss chard, carrots, and kale
So I'll remember my kid's name, dementia is a sick game
I'm silencin' the lamb, call me Hannibal Failed, yeah
Financial plans should be handled in stealth
I fight to lead a private life for my family's health
Got some dinner with art collectors, they started drinkin' Prosecco
When they slipped about their level of family wealth
Bunch of actresses downplay how my records are felt
It's not a mystery to decode a fan in yourself
"This man's on fire," I can't pretend I'm not talented
For me to fake humble's a corny way to be arrogant
Drug dealers still on the corner of Madison
Except they push Pradas and Red Bottoms to Madisons
Red bottoms for baboons and radishes
I went to Mozambique and saw a real kind of happiness
So I don't feel guilty when Nike sends me some packages
We still end up in boxes even though we chase packagin', mmm
Mmm, take this, take this, TUAMIE supply the facelift, uh
Take this, take this, TUAMIE supply the facelift
I can't fall off, I got a great grip
Go and find some talent, have a great trip, uh
This Bellion guy's power level is amazing
Uh, take this, take this, TUAMIE supply the face lift, mmm
Prepare to fight
My stance here as a band leader is Pangaea
My heart frío, I'm cold, heater than Cambria
I rock steady, my Johnson's Dwayne-heavy
We just erase heroes, I'll Stan Lee ya, Remini, he the king of Queens
My bars breathe Lebron's Kia, I carry greatness
Statements on spaceship, Haitians get LASIK
Meaning you dread what comes from my third eye
Blind to the fake shit (Wow)
My tone is gettin' aggressive
I just create for the truly gifted of adolescence
My essence becomes the mystery
I instantly become a Pistol Pete in a sport full of Walt Fraziers
My Kelsey Grammer is somethin' like Thor with a hammer (Special)
Like Alfred Hitchcock with a camera (Beam)
Just Blaze and Killa Cam with a sample
Both hands on the candle, can't handle it (Cannon!)
My channel too hot to cancel, my baby's drivin', I'm Ansel
I'm passenger writin' stanzas, I'm holdin' these verses ransom
I'm Hansel Zoolander handsome
TUAMIE supply the face lift
Oh, I have a purpose (I have a purpose)
Oh yeah (I have—)

It's all because of (Jesus)
Well done, welcome to Glory Sound Prep
I'm lovin' it all, here with my brother-in-law
Greece is a beautiful place, food is incredible, awe
We just been playin' some games, everyone's pickin' a straw
Who gets the longest has gotta go tell the butler to call
Uh, haha, for more alcohol
Wait, we told the locals that we'd go and play basketball
But they don't want the business
Plus, I drank from the flask we bought, now everything is spinnin'
Then we laugh it off
Ooh, it's Whoopi Goldberg the way that my sisters act up, uh
They had some champagne, now everybody's laughing
Movies 'bout paradise, and my family got the casting
If you dove into the tears of my eyes, you'd hear this instrumental
Jesus was instrumental in blessing my mental
Every time I drove a car, coulda twisted the metal
Yeah, all the things on my wish list, God has given in triplets, uh
I'm on an island where opiates go to rich kids
And then they pass away, that's called death over the privilege
Yeah, I never wanna be famous, stop callin' me underrated
I'm still pushin' the same whip I was drivin' in Sachem, uh
Peace in my life, it's on some As-salamu alaykum
I'm makin' certain decisions, I'm flyin' under the radar
I really love my life and this music thing is a great job
Yeah, pick up the phone and someone tells me, "Mr. Bellion, sir
Beyoncé on the line, she tryna reach you on your cellular"
She wanted "Fall In Line," but we gave it to Aguilera, uh
I hope it's the right decision, Bey wanted it for the twins she signed
I hope I didn't burn that bridge, I worry all the time
I'm just tryna show these kids about this light of mine
I always flex, but I realize that it's divine appointment
I'm a cross between hard work and Jesus-anointed
I hope the sinner that needed grace is the final notion
For the rest of my life, you'll see me on the L-I-double R
With a Heineken in my bag, on my way to the Garden
Tryin' to kill your nephews like I been fuckin' with Scar
Me lyin' down on the job is Nala option at all, uh
On my way to the Garden, uh, uh
On my way to the, uh, uh, uh, uh
On my way to the Gar—

WHATTA MAN

Yeee-hey, yeah
Alright
Come on now
Yeah
Talk to me
Yeah

Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
Gotta say it again now
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
He's a mighty mighty good man
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
Yes, he is
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
Yeah

I wanna take a minute or two, and give much respect due
To the man that's made a difference in my world
And although most men are ho's he flows on the down low
'Cause I never heard about him with another girl
But I don't sweat it because it's just pathetic
To let it get me involved in that he said/she said crowd
I know that ain't nobody perfect
I give props to those who deserve it
And believe me y'all, he's worth it
So here's to the future 'cause we got through the past
I finally found somebody that can make me laugh
(Ha ha ha) You so crazy
I think I wanna have your baby
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
Yes, he is
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
He's a  mighty mighty good man
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
You gotta say it again now
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
Heeh

My man is smooth like Barry, and his voice got bass
A body like Arnold with a Denzel face
He's smart like a doctor with a real good rep
And when he comes home he's relaxed with Pep
He always got a gift for me everytime I see him
A lot of snot-nosed ex-flames couldn't be him
He never ran a corny line once to me yet
So I give him stuff that he'll never forget
He keeps me on Cloud Nine just like the Temps
He's not a fake wannabe tryin' to be a pimp
He dresses like a dapper don, but even in jeans
He's a God-sent original, the man of my dreams
Yes, my man says he loves me, never says he loves me not
Nah don' rush me good, and touch me in the right spot
See other guys that I've had, they tried to play all that mac (shit)
But every time they tried I said, "That's not it"
But not this man, he's got the right potion
Baby, rub it down and make it smooth like lotion
Yeah, the ritual, highway to heaven
From seven to seven he's got me open like Seven Eleven
And yes, it's me that he's always choosin'
With him I'm never losin', and he knows that my name is not Susan
He always has heavy conversation for the mind
Which means a lot to me cuz good men are hard to find

Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
He's a  mighty mighty good man
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
Say it again now
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
Ohh, uuuh
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
I said what a mighty good man
You know what I'm sayin', he's a mighty mighty good man
Y'all hear me, now check it out
My man gives real loving, that's why I call him Killer
He's not a wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am, he's a thriller
He takes his time and does everything right
Knocks me out with one shot for the rest of the night
He's a real smooth brother, never in a rush
And he gives me goose pimples with every single touch
Spends quality time with his kids when he can
Secure in his manhood 'cause he's a real man
A lover and a fighter and he'll knock a knucker out
Don't take him for a sucker 'cause that's not what he's about
Every time I need him, he always got my back
Never disrespectful 'cause his mama taught him that
I've got a good man

Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
A mighty mighty good man
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
Yes he is
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
What a mighty good man
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
He's a mighty mighty good man
What a mighty mighty good man
Tell me like that sugar
Now break it down
I break it down one time
Whatta man, whatta man
Whatta man, whatta man
Whatta man, whatta man

ASCENSION

It happened the moment, when you were revealed
Cause you were a dream that you should not have been
A fantasy real
You gave me this beating baby
This rhythm inside
And you made me feel good and feel nice and feel loved
Give me paradise

You're the highest of the high
If you don't know, then I'll say it
So don't ever wonder (don't ever wonder)

If you don't know, then I'll say it

CRASH INTO ME

You've got your ball, you got your chain
Tied to me tight, tie me up again

Into your heart I'll beat again
Sweet like candy to my soul
Sweet you rock, and sweet you roll
Lost for you, I'm so lost, for you

Oh, when you come
Crash into me

Hike up your skirt a little more
And show the world to me
Hike up your skirt a little more
And show your world to me
A boy's dream, in a boys dream

Through the window

You wear nothing but you
Wear it so well
Tied up and twisted

For you, for me, come crash

CHAMPAGNE SUPERNOVA

How many special people change?
How many lives are living strange?
Where were you while we were getting high?

Slowly walking down the hall
Faster than a cannonball
Where were you while we were getting high?

Someday you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova in the sky
Someday you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova
A champagne supernova in the sky

Wake up the dawn and ask her why
A dreamer dreams she never dies
Wipe that tear away now from your eye

Slowly walking down the hall
Faster than a cannonball
Where were you while we were getting high?
Someday you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova in the sky
Someday you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova
A champagne supernova

'Cause people believe
That they're gonna get away for the summer
But you and I, we live and die
The world's still spinning 'round, we don't know why
Why? Why? Why? Why?

SHIMMER

She calls me from the cold
Just when I was low, feeling short of stable
And all that she intends
And all she keeps inside, isn't on the label
She says she's ashamed
Can she take me for a while?
And can I be a friend?
We'll forget the past
Or maybe I'm not able
And I break at the bend

We're here and now
Will we ever be again?
'Cause I have found
All that shimmers in this world is sure to fade
Away again

She dreams a champagne dream
Strawberry surprise, pink linen and white paper
Lavender and cream
Fields of butterflies, reality escapes her
She says that love is for fools who fall behind
And I'm somewhere between
I never really know
A killer from a savior
'Til I break at the bend
We're here and now
Will we ever be again?
'Cause I have found
All that shimmers in this world is sure to fade
Away again

It's too far away for me to hold
It's too far away
It's too far away for me to hold
It's too far away
Ah oh

Yeah, it's too far away for me to hold
It's too far away
Ah ah oh
It's too far away for me to hold
It's too far away
It's too far away for me to hold
It's too far away
Ah ah oh
It's too far away for me to hold
It's too far away
Guess I'll let it go

SHE'S SO HIGH

She's blood, flesh, and bone
No tucks or silicone
She's touch, smell, sight, taste, and sound
But somehow I can't believe that anything should happen
I know where I belong and nothing's gonna happen, yeah

'Cause she's so high
High above me, she's so lovely
She's so high, like Cleopatra, Joan of Arc, or Aphrodite
Da-da-da-da
She's so high, high above me

First class and fancy-free
She's high society
She's got the best of everything
What could a guy like me ever really offer?
She's perfect as she can be
Why should I even bother?
A-ah

'Cause she's so high
High above me, she's so lovely
She's so high, like Cleopatra, Joan of Arc, or Aphrodite
Da-da-da-da
She's so high, high above me

She comes to speak to me
I freeze immediately
'Cause what she says sounds so unreal
'Cause somehow I can't believe that anything should happen
I know where I belong and nothing's gonna happen
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

'Cause she's so high
High above me, she's so lovely
She's so high, like Cleopatra, Joan of Arc, or Aphrodite
Oh yeah, yeah
She's so high, high above me

RETURN OF THE MACK

Ooh-oh-oh-oh
Come on
Oh yeah

Well, I tried to tell you so (Yes, I did)
But I guess you didn't know
As the saddest story goes
Baby, now I got the flow
'Cause I knew it from the start
Baby, when you broke my heart
That I had to come again
And show you that I'd win

You lied to me
All those times I said that I loved you
You lied to me
Yes, I tried, yes I tried
You lied to me
Even though you knew I'd die for you
You lied to me
Yes, I cried, yes I cried

You know that I'll be back (Here I go)
So, I'm back up in the game (Hustling snow)
Running things to keep my swing (All night long)
Letting all the people know
That I'm back to run the show
'Cause what you did you know was wrong
And all the nasty things you've done (Oh, oh, oh)
So baby listen carefully
While I sing my comeback song

You lied to me
'Cause she said she'd never turn on me
You lied to me
But you did, but you did
You lied to me
All this pain you said I'd never feel
You lied to me
But I do, but I do, do, do

Return of the Mack (There it is)
Return of the Mack (Hold on)

DOO WOP

Yo, remember back on the Bully
When cats used to harmonize like
Yo, yo, my men and my women
Don't forget about the deen
Sirat al-Mustaqeem
Yo, it's about a thing, uh, yo, yo
If ya feel real good wave your hands in the air
And lick two shots in the atmosphere!
(Put them up, put them up)
(Put them up, put them up)
(Put them up, put them up)

It's been three weeks since you were looking for your friend
The one you let hit it and never called you again
'Member when he told you he was 'bout the Benjamins?
You act like you ain't hear him then give him a little trim
To begin, how you think you're really gon' pretend
Like you wasn't down and you called him again?
Plus, when you give it up so easy you ain't even foolin' him
If you did it then, then you'd probably fuck again
Talking out your neck, sayin' you're a Christian
A Muslim, sleeping with the jinn
Now that was the sin that did Jezebel in
Who you gon' tell when the repercussions spin?
Showing off your ass 'cause you're thinking it's a trend
Girlfriend, let me break it down for you again
You know I only say it 'cause I'm truly genuine
Don't be a hard rock when you really are a gem
Baby girl, respect is just a minimum
Niggas fucked up and you still defending 'em
Now, Lauryn is only human
Don't think I haven't been through the same predicament
Let it sit inside your head like a million women in Philly, Penn
It's silly when girls sell their souls because it's in
Look at where you be in, hair weaves like Europeans
Fake nails done by Koreans
Come again
(A win win, come again
A win win, come again)

Guys you know you'd better watch out
Some girls, some girls are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing

The second verse is dedicated to the men
More concerned with his rims and his Timbs than his women
Him and his men come in the club like hooligans
Don't care who they offend, poppin' yang (like you got yen!)
Let's stop pretend, the ones that pack pistols by they waist men
Cristal by the case men, still in they mother's basement
The pretty face men claiming that they did a bid men
Need to take care of they three or four kids
And they face a court case when the child support late
Money taking and heart breaking, now you wonder why women hate men
The sneaky, silent men
The punk, domestic violence men
Quick to shoot the semen, stop acting like boys and be men
How you gonna win when you ain't right within?
How you gonna win when you ain't right within?
How you gonna win when you ain't right within?
Come again, come again
Come again, come again
Watch out, watch out
Look out, look out
Watch out, watch out
Look out, look out
Watch out, watch out
Look out, look out
Watch out, watch out
Look out, look out

Girls, you know you'd better watch out
Some guys, some guys are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing
Guys, you know you'd better watch out
'Cause girls, some girls are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing

Class!
Hey, we’ve got some very intelligent women here, man
Do you think you’re too young to really love somebody?
(No! No, no, I don’t think so)
I say it for me, uh, I’m an adult I say, wait
“You’re too young to be in love, this is silly
You’re infatuated or whatever, you got nice jeans
You wear fancy Adidas”
I mean, it might be something I don’t know
(It's the difference from loving somebody and being in love with somebody)
Well, you tell me. What’s the difference?
(Okay, You can love anybody but when you’re in love with somebody you’re looking at it like this: You’re taking that person for what he or she is no matter what he or she look like or no matter what he or she do)
(You’re crazy! You fall in love, you can fall out of love)
(You might stop being in love but you are not gonna stop loving that person)
(Maybe they ain’t never been loved before or been in love before, they don’t know what the feeling is to be loved)
(She poetic)
She killed it, we could end that conversation with that, right?

Bitch, your hormones prolly switch inside your DNA
Problem is, all that sucker shit inside your DNA
Daddy prolly snitched, heritage inside your DNA
Backbone don't exist, born outside a jellyfish, I gauge
See, my pedigree most definitely don't tolerate the front
Shit I've been through prolly offend you, this is Paula's oldest son
I know murder, conviction
Burners, boosters, burglars, ballers, dead, redemption
Scholars, fathers dead with kids and
I wish I was fed forgiveness
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, soldier’s DNA (I’m a soldier's DNA)
Born inside the beast, my expertise checked out in second grade
When I was 9, on cell, motel, we didn’t have nowhere to stay
At 29, I've done so well, hit cartwheel in my estate
And I'm gon' shine like I’m supposed to, antisocial extrovert
And excellent mean the extra work
And absentness what the fuck you heard
And pessimists never struck my nerve
And Nazareth gonna plead his case
The reason my power's here on earth
Salute the truth, when the prophet say
I-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
This is why I say that hip hop has done more damage to young African Americans than racism in recent years
I-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a better life, I'm rollin' several dice, fuck your life
I-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a be-, fuck your life
5, 4, 3, 2, 1
This is my heritage, all I'm inheritin'
Money and power, the mecca of marriages
Tell me somethin'
You mothafuckas can't tell me nothin'
I'd rather die than to listen to you
My DNA not for imitation
Your DNA an abomination
This how it is when you in the Matrix
Dodgin' bullets, reapin' what you sow
And stackin' up the footage, livin' on the go
And sleepin' in a villa
Sippin' from a Grammy, walkin' in the buildin'
Diamond in the ceilin', marble on the floors
Beach inside the window, peekin' out the window
Baby in the pool, godfather goals
Only Lord knows I've been goin' hammer
Dodgin' paparazzi, freakin' through the cameras
Eat at Four Daughters, Brock wearin' sandals
Yoga on a Monday, stretchin' to Nirvana
Watchin' all the snakes, curvin' all the fakes
Phone never on, I don't conversate
I don't compromise, I just penetrate
Sex, money, murder—these are the breaks
These are the times, level number 9
Look up in the sky, 10 is on the way
Sentence on the way, killings on the way
Motherfucker, I got winners on the way
You ain't shit without a body on your belt
You ain't shit without a ticket on your plate
You ain't sick enough to pull it on yourself
You ain't rich enough to hit the lot and skate
Tell me when destruction gonna be my fate
Gonna be your fate, gonna be our faith
Peace to the world, let it rotate
Sex, money, murder—our DNA

FANTASY

Oh, when you walk by every night
Talking sweet and looking fine
I get kind of hectic inside
Mmm, baby, I'm so into you
Darling, if you only knew
All the things that flow through my mind

But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
When I close my eyes, you come and take me
On and on and on, it's so deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby (Fantasy)
(And I want you so bad)

Images of rapture
Creep into me slowly
As you're going to my head
And my heart beats faster
When you take me over
Time and time and time again

But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
When I close my eyes, you come and take me
On and on and on, it's so deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby (Fantasy)
Oh, oh, it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
When I close my eyes you come and take me
On and on and on, it's so deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby (Fantasy)
I'm in heaven
With my boyfriend, my laughing boyfriend
There's no beginning and there is no end
Feels like I'm dreaming, but I'm not sleeping

Oh, it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
When I close my eyes, you come and take me
On and on and on, it's so deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
Sweet, sweet fantasy, baby

Woo-hoo, that's for all the time
I look just like Buddy Holly
And you're Mary Tyler Moore
I don't care what they say about us anyway
I don't care 'bout that
I don't care 'bout that

Bang! Bang! Knock on the door
Another big bang, get down on the floor
Oh no! What do we do?
Don't look now but I lost my shoe
I can't run and I can't kick
What's a matter, babe, are you feelin' sick?
What's a matter, what's a matter, what's a matter you?
What's a matter, babe, are you feelin' blue? Oh-oh!


That's for all the time
That's for all the time

I look just like Buddy Holly
And you're Mary Tyler Moore
I don't care what they say about us anyway
I don't care 'bout that
I don't care 'bout that
I don't care 'bout that
I don't care 'bout that

RIGHT HERE

* Taje of SWV RAPS on this song

Lately, there's seem to be
Some insecurities
About the way I feel
Where I wanna be
But you know, it's with you
No one can do
The things you do
To me
Never to be mistaking
Long as it's love we're making
There'll be no hesitating
You and me
It always will be
And I won't leave
Your side
Cause you know (Love will be)

Right here
Be right here
Right here
Be right here
Don't you have
No fear (No fear)
Have no fear
No tears (No tears)
Love is here
True love, some don't believe in
That's what just I'm givin'
I'm gonna keep it strong
I'll be holding on
To you
No one can do
Me like you do
It's true
Sure as the sun is shining
Our love will keep on climbing
There's gonna be some rain
Gonna be some pain
But as long as I know
Boy, time will show
Our love will grow
And I know (Love will be)

Right here
Be right here (Be right here)
Right here
Be right here (you don't need to have)
No fear (No fear)
Have no fear
No tears
Love will be
Right here
Be right here
Right here
Be right here (you don't need to have no)
No fear (no fear)
Have no fear
No tears
Love is here

Won't let go
You should know
This thing is real
No questions
Just listen to your heart and
Love will be right

Baby, what's the problem, it seems like we're having trouble
You don't seem to understand
The life I lead ain't double
My heart belongs to you, and only you
And you know it's true
A phony imitation just won't do
Relax your mind, I'm not the kind who runs around and wastes no time
On the fine brothers that just don't compare
I'll be there, I swear, far and near, have no fear
I don't care
You can count on me, I'm right here
Right here
Be right here (Right here)
Right here
Be right here (you don't need to have no)
No fear (No fear)
Have no fear
No tears (No tears)
Love is here
Right here
Be right here
Right here
Be right here
No fear
Have no fear
No tears
Love will be

Love's gonna be
Love's gonna be
Love's gonna be
Love's gonna be (Right here)
Love's gonna be
Love's gonna be
Be right here
No fear
Love's gonna be
Love's gonna be
Love's gonna be
Love's gonna be (No tears)
Love is here
Love's gonna be
Love's gonna be
Love's gonna be
Love's gonna be
Love's gonna be
Love's gonna be

ONLY WANNA BE WITH YOU

You and me
We come from different worlds
You like to laugh at me when I look at other girls
Sometimes you're crazy
And you wonder why
I'm such a baby 'cause the Dolphins make me cry

Well there's nothing I can do
I've been looking for a girl like you

You look at me
You've got nothing left to say
I'll only pout at you until I get my way
I won't dance
You won't sing
I just want to love you but you want to wear my ring

Well there's nothing I can do
I only wanna be with you
You can call me your fool
I only wanna be with you
Put on a little Dylan
Sitting on a fence
I say that line is great
You ask me what it meant by
Said I shot a man named Gray
Took his wife to Italy
She inherited a million bucks
And when she died it came to me

I can't help it if I'm lucky
I only wanna be with you
Ain't Bobby so cool
I only wanna be with you

Yeah I'm tangled up in blue
I only wanna be with you
You can call me your fool
Only wanna be with you

Sometimes I wonder if it will ever end
You get so mad at me
When I go out with my friends
Sometimes you're crazy
And you wonder why
I'm such a baby, yeah
The Dolphins make me cry
Well there's nothing I can do
I only wanna be with you
You can call me your fool
I only wanna be with you

Yeah I'm tangled up in blue
I only wanna be with you
I only wanna be with you
I only wanna be with you
I only wanna be with you

PEOPLE EVERYDAY

See I was restin' at the park mindin' my own
Business as I kick up the treble tone
On my radio tape player box, right
Just loud enough so folks could hear it's hype, see?
Outta nowhere comes the woman I'm datin'
Investigation maybe she was demonstratin'
But nevertheless I was pleased
My day was goin' great and my soul was at ease
Until a group of brothers started buggin' out
Drinkin' the 40 oz, goin' the nigga route
Disrespectin' my black queen
Holdin' their crotches and bein' obscene
At first I ignored them 'cause see I know their type
They got drunk and got guns and they wanna fight
And they see a young couple having a time that's good
And their egos wanna test a brother's manhood
So they came to test Speech 'cause of my hair-do
And the loud bright colors that I wear (boom!)
I was a target 'cause I'm a fashion misfit
And the outfit that I'm wearin' brothers dissin' it
Well I stay calm and pray the niggas leave me be
But they're squeezin' parts of my date's anatomy
Why, Lord, do brothers have to drill me?
'Cause if I start to hit this man he'll have to kill me, see
I am everyday people
You see, I am everyday people

I told the niggas please let us pass, friend
I said please 'cause I don't like killin' Africans
But he wouldn't stop and I ain't Ice Cube
But I had to take the brother out for being rude
And like I said before I was mad by then
It took three or four cops to pull me off of him
But that's the story y'all of a black man
Actin' like a nigga and get stomped by an African
You see

I am everyday people
You see, I am everyday people

The moral of the story is
You better look very hard at who you're steppin' to
'Cause you might get killed or shot and it's not worth it
Africans need to be lovin' each other and unite
***************

I HAVE NOTHING

Share my life, take me for what I am
'Cause I'll never change all my colors for you
Take my love, I'll never ask for too much
Just all that you are and everything that you do

I don't really need to look very much further
I don't wanna have to go where you don't follow
I won't hold it back again, this passion inside
Can't run from myself, there's nowhere to hide

But don't make me close one more door
I don't wanna hurt anymore
Stay in my arms if you dare
Or must I imagine you there
Don't walk away from me
I have nothing, nothing, nothing
If I don't have you, you, you, you, you

You see through, right to the heart of me
You break down my walls with the strength of your love, mm
I never knew love like I've known it with you
Will a memory survive, one I can hold on to
I don't really need to look very much further
I don't wanna have to go where you don't follow
I won't hold it back again, this passion inside
I can't run from myself, there's nowhere to hide
Your love, I'll remember forever

But don't make me close one more door
I don't wanna hurt anymore
Stay in my arms if you dare
Or must I imagine you there
Don't walk away from me
I have nothing, nothing, nothing
Don't make me close one more door
I don't wanna hurt anymore
Stay in my arms if you dare
Or must I imagine you there
Don't walk away from me
Don't walk away from me

Don't you dare walk away from me
I have nothing, nothing, nothing
If I don't have you, you
If I don't have you, oh you

PUSH

(She said) I don't know if I've ever been good enough
I'm a little bit rusty, and I think my head is caving in
And I don't know if I've ever been really loved
By a hand that's touched me, well I feel like something's
Gonna give
And i'm a little bit angry, well
This ain't over, no not here, not while I still need you
Around
You don't owe me, we might change
Yeah we just might feel good
I wanna push you around, I will, I will
I wanna push you down, I will, I will
I wanna take you for granted, I wanna take you for granted
I will
(She said) I don't know why you ever would lie to me
Like I'm a little untrusting when I think that the truth is
Gonna hurt ya
And I don't know why you couldn't just stay with me
You couldn't stand to be near me
When my face don't seem to want to shine
'Cause it's a little bit dirty, well
Don't just stand there, say nice things to me
'Cause I've been cheated I've been wronged, and you
You don't know me, well I can't change
I won't do anything at all
I wanna push you around, I will, I will
I wanna push you down, I will, I will
I wanna take you for granted, I wanna take you for granted
I will
Oh but don't bowl me over
Just wait a minute well it kinda fell apart, things get so
Crazy, crazy
Don't rush this baby, don't rush this baby
I wanna push you around, I will, I will
I wanna push you down, I will, I will
I wanna take you for granted, i wanna take you for granted
I will
***************

ONE WEEK

It's been one week since you looked at me
Cocked your head to the side and said, "I'm angry"
Five days since you laughed at me, saying
"Get your act together, come back and see me"
Three days since the living room
I realized it's all my fault, but couldn't tell you
Yesterday, you'd forgiven me
But it'll still be two days 'til I say I'm sorry

Hold it now and watch the hoodwink
As I make you stop, think
You'll think you're looking at Aquaman
I summon fish to the dish, although I like the Chalet Swiss
I like the sushi 'cause it's never touched a frying pan
Hot like wasabi when I bust rhymes
Big like LeAnn Rimes, because I'm all about value
Bert Kaempfert's got the mad hits
You try to match wits, you try to hold me but I bust through
Gonna make a break and take a fake
I'd like a stinking aching shake
I like vanilla, it's the finest of the flavours
Gotta see the show, 'cause then you'll know
The vertigo is gonna grow
'Cause it's so dangerous, you'll have to sign a waiver
How can I help it if I think you're funny when you're mad?
Trying hard not to smile, though I feel bad
I'm the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral
Can't understand what I mean? Well, you soon will
I have a tendency to wear my mind on my sleeve
I have a history of taking off my shirt

It's been one week since you looked at me
Threw your arms in the air and said, "You're crazy"
Five days since you tackled me
I've still got the rug burns on both my knees
It's been three days since the afternoon
You realized it's not my fault not a moment too soon
Yesterday, you'd forgiven me
And now I sit back and wait 'til you say you're sorry

Chickity China, the Chinese chicken
You have a drumstick and your brain stops tickin'
Watching X-Files with no lights on
We're dans la maison
I hope the Smoking Man's in this one
Like Harrison Ford, I'm getting frantic
Like Sting, I'm tantric
Like Snickers, guaranteed to satisfy
Like Kurosawa, I make mad films, 'kay, I don't make films
But if I did they'd have a Samurai
Gonna get a set of better clubs
Gonna find the kind with tiny nubs
Just so my irons aren't always flying off the back-swing
Gotta get in tune with Sailor Moon
'Cause that cartoon has got the boom anime babes
That make me think the wrong thing
How can I help it if I think you're funny when you're mad?
Trying hard not to smile, though I feel bad
I'm the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral
Can't understand what I mean? You soon will
I have a tendency to wear my mind on my sleeve
I have a history of losing my shirt

It's been one week since you looked at me
Dropped your arms to the sides and said, "I'm sorry"
Five days since I laughed at you and said
"You just did just what I thought you were gonna do"
Three days since the living room
We realized we're both to blame but what could we do?
Yesterday, you just smiled at me
'Cause it'll still be two days 'til we say we're sorry

It'll still be two days 'til we say we're sorry
It'll still be two days 'til we say "Wasabi"
Birchmount Stadium, home of the Robbie

CREEP

When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here

I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
Oh, oh

She's running out the door
She's running out
She run, run, run, run
Run

Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here
***************

FADE INTO YOU

I wanna hold the hand inside you
I wanna take the breath that's true
I look to you and I see nothing
I look to you to see the truth
You live your life, you go in shadows
You'll come apart and you'll go blind
Some kind of light into your darkness
Colors your eyes with what's not there

Fade into you
Strange you never knew
Fade into you
I think it's strange you never knew


A stranger's light comes on slowly
A stranger's heart without a home
You put your hands into your head
A million smiles cover your heart

Fade into you
Strange you never knew
Fade into you
I think it's strange you never knew
Fade into you
Strange you never knew
Fade into you
I think it's strange you never knew
I think it's strange you never knew

HOW BIZARRE

Brother Pele's in the back, Sweet Zina's in the front
Cruisin' down the freeway in the hot, hot sun
Suddenly red-blue lights flash us from behind
Loud voice booming, "Please step out onto the line"
Pele preaches words of comfort, Zina just hides her eyes
Policeman taps his shades, "Is that a Chevy '69?"

How bizarre
How bizarre, how bizarre
Destination unknown as we pull in for some gas
A freshly pasted poster reveals a smile from the past
Elephants and acrobats, lions, snakes, monkey
Pele speaks "righteous," Sister Zina says "funky"

How bizarre
How bizarre, how bizarre

Ooh, baby (Ooh, baby)
It's making me crazy (It's making me crazy)
Every time I look around (Look around)
Every time I look around (Every time I look around)
Every time I look around
It's in my face
Ringmaster steps out and says "The elephants left town"
People jump and jive and the clowns have stuck around
TV news and cameras, there's choppers in the sky
Marines, police, reporters ask where, for and why
Pele yells, "We're outta here," Zina says, "Right on"
Making moves and starting grooves before they knew we were gone
Jumped into the Chevy and headed for big lights
Wanna know the rest? Hey, buy the rights

How bizarre
How bizarre, how bizarre

Ooh, baby (Ooh, baby)
It's making me crazy (It's making me crazy)
Every time I look around (Look around)
Every time I look around (Every time I look around)
Every time I look around
It's in my face
(It's in my face)
Ooh, baby (Ooh, baby)
It's making me crazy (It's making me crazy)
Every time I look around (Look around)
Every time I look around (Every time I look around)
Every time I look around
It's in my face
Ooh, baby (Ooh, baby)
It's making me crazy (It's making me crazy)
Every time I look around (Look around)
Every time I look around (Look around)
Every time I look around
It's in my face

BILLS, BILLS, BILLS

At first, we started out real cool
Takin' me places I ain't never been
But now, you're getting comfortable
Ain't doin' those things you did no more
You're slowly makin' me pay for things
Your money should be handling
And now you ask to use my car (Car)
Drive it all day and don't fill up the tank
And you have the audacity
To even come and step to me and
Ask to hold some money from me
Until you get yo' check next week

You triflin', good-for-nothing type of brother
Silly me, why haven't I found another?
A baller, when times get hard
I need someone to help me out
Instead of a scrub like you
Who don't know what a man's about

Can you pay my bills?

Do you pay my automo' bills?
If you did, then maybe we could chill
I don't think you do
So, you and me are through

Now you've been maxing out my card (Card)
Gave me bad credit, buyin' me gifts with my own ends
Haven't paid the first bill
But you're steady headin' to the mall
Goin' on shopping sprees, perpetratin'
To your friends like you be ballin'
And then you use my cellphone (Phone)
Callin' whoever that you thinks at home
And then, when the bill comes
All of a sudden, you be actin' dumb
Don't know where none of these calls come from
When your momma's number's here more than once

You triflin', good-for-nothing type of brother
Silly me, why haven't I found another?
A baller, when times get hard
I need someone to help me out
Instead of a scrub like you

I GOT 5 ON IT

Creep on in, on in, on in (Whoa)
See I'm ridin' high (Whoa)
Kinda broke this evening, y'all, so all I got's five, I got five

Player, give me some brew and I might just chill
But I'm the type that like to light another joint, like Cypress Hill
I steal doobies, spit loogies when I puff on it
I got some bucks on it, but it ain't enough on it
Go get the S, the T, I D-E-S
Nevertheless, I'm hella fresh, rollin' joints like a cigarette
So pass it 'cross the table like ping pong
I'm gone, beatin' my chest like King Kong
It's on, wrap my lips around the forty and when it comes to
Getting another stogie, fools all kick in like
Shinobi. No, he ain't my homie to begin with
It's too many heads to be poppin' to let my friend hit it
Bit unless you pull out the fat, crispy
Five-dollar bill, on the real, before it's history
‘Cause fools be havin' them vacuum lungs
And if you let 'em hit it for free, you hella dumb-da-dumb-dumb
I come to school with the Taylor on my earlobe
Avoiding all the thick teasers, skeezers, and weirdos
That be blowing off the land, like, "Where the bomb at?"
Give me two bucks, you take a puff, and pass my bomb back
Suck up that dank like a Slurpee, the serious
Bomb will make a niggy go delirious, like Eddie Murphy
I got more growing pains than Maggie
‘Cause homies nag me to take the dank out of the baggie
I got five on it (got it, good), grab your four, let's get keyed
I got five on it, messin' with that Indo weed
I got five on it (got it, good), it's got me stuck, and I'm tore back
I got five on it, partner, let's go half on a sack

I take sacks to the
Face whenever I can, don't need no crutch
I'm so keyed up till the joint be burning my hand
Next time I roll it in a hampa to burn
Slow, so the ashes won't be burning up my hand, bruh
Hoochies can hit, but they know they got to pitch in
Then I roll a joint that's longer than your extension (hahaha)
‘Cause I'll be damned if you get high off me for free
Hell no! You better bring your own spliff, chief
What's up? Don't babysit that, better pass the
Joint, stop hitting, ‘cause you know you got asthma
Crack a 40 open, homie, and guzzle it
‘Cause I know the weed in my system is gettin' lonely
I gotta take a whiz test to my P. O
I know I failed, ‘cause I done smoked major weed, bro
And every time we with Chris, that fool rollin' up a
Fatty, but the Tanqueray straight had me

I got five on it; grab your four, let's get keyed
I got five on it; messin' with that Indo weed
I got five on it; it's got me stuck, and I'm tore back
I got five on it; partner, let's go half on a sack
Ayy, make this right, mane, stop at the light, mane
My yester-night thing got me hung off the night train
You fade, I fade, so let's head to the East
Hit the stroll to 9-0, so we can roll big hashish
I wish I could fade the eighth, but I'm low budget
Still rollin' a two-door Cutlass, same old bucket
Foggy windows, soggy Indo
I'm in the 'land getting smoked with my kinfolk

I been smoked
Yuk'll spray ya, lay you down up in the O-A-K
The Town, homies don't play around, we down to blaze a pound
Then ease up, speed up through the E-S-O
Drink the V-S-O-P up, with a lemon squeeze up
And everybody's rolled up, I'm the roller
That's quick to fold a blunt out of a bunch of sticky doja
Hold up, suck up my weed is all you do
Kick in feed, ‘cause where I be we needs half, like Umfufu

I got five on it; grab your four, let's get keyed
I got five on it; messin' with that Indo weed
I got five on it; it's got me stuck, and I'm tore back
I got five on it; partner, let's go half on a sack

CALIFORNIA LOVE

California love
California knows how to party
California knows how to party
In the city of L.A
In the city of good ol' Watts
In the city, the city of Compton
We keep it rockin', we keep it rockin'

Now let me welcome everybody to the Wild Wild West
A state that's untouchable like Eliot Ness
The track hits your eardrum like a slug to your chest
Pack a vest for your Jimmy in the city of sex
We in that sunshine state where the bomb-ass hemp be
The state where you never find a dance floor empty
And pimps be on a mission for them greens
Lean mean money-making-machines servin' fiends
I been in the game for 10 years makin' rap tunes
Ever since honeys was wearin' Sassoon
Now it's '95 and they clock me and watch me
Diamonds shinin', lookin' like I robbed Liberace
It's all good, from Diego to the Bay
Your city is the bomb if your city makin' pay
Throw up a finger if you feel the same way
Dre puttin' it down for Californ-i-a
California knows how to party
California knows how to party (Yes, they do)
In the city of L.A
In the city of good ol' Watts
In the city, the city of Compton
We keep it rockin', we keep it rockin'

Shake, shake it, baby
Shake, shake it, mama
Shake it, Cali
Shake it, shake it, baby
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it
Out on bail, fresh out of jail, California dreamin'
Soon as I step on the scene, I'm hearin' hoochies screamin'
Fiendin' for money and alcohol, the life of a Westside player
Where cowards die and the strong ball
Only in Cali where we riot, not rally, to live and die
In L.A. we wearin' Chucks, not Ballys (yeah, that's right)
Dressed in Locs and Khaki suits, and ride is what we do
Flossin' but have caution: we collide with other crews
Famous because we throw grams
Worldwide, let them recognize from Long Beach to Rosecrans
Bumpin' and grindin' like a slow jam
It's Westside, so you know the Row won't bow down to no man
Say what you say, but give me that bomb beat from Dre
Let me serenade the streets of L.A
From Oakland to Sac-town, the Bay Area and back down
Cali is where they put their mack down; give me love!
California knows how to party
California knows how to party (Yes, they do)
In the city of L.A

ALRIGHT

We are young, we run green
Keep our teeth nice and clean
See our friends, see the sights
And feel alright

We wake up, we go out
Smoke a fag, put it out
See our friends, see the sights
And feel alright

Are we like you?
I can't be sure
Of the scene as she turns
We are strange in our worlds

But we are young, we get by
Can't go mad, ain't got time
Sleep around if we like
But we're alright

Got some cash, bought some wheels
Took it out 'cross the fields
Lost control, hit a wall
But we're alright
Are we like you?
I can't be sure
Of the scene as she turns
We are strange in our worlds

But we are young, we run green
Keep our teeth nice and clean
See our friends, see the sights
And feel alright

Are we like you?
I can't be sure
Of the scene as she turns
We are strange in our worlds

But we are young, we run green
Keep our teeth nice and clean
See our friends, see the sights
And feel alright...

NO DIGGITY

No diggity!
You know what
I like the playettes
No diggity, no doubt
Play on playette, play on playette
Yo Dre, drop the verse

It's going down, fade to Blackstreet
The homies got at me, collab' creations, bump like acne
No doubt, I put it down, never slouch
As long as my credit can vouch, a dog couldn't catch me ass out
Tell me who can stop when Dre makin' moves
Attracting honeys like a magnet
Giving 'em eargasms with my mellow accent
Still moving this flavor
With the homies Blackstreet and Teddy
The original rump shakers
Shorty get down, good Lord
Baby got 'em open all over town
Strictly biz, she don't play around
Cover much grounds, got game by the pound
Getting paid is her forte
Each and every day, true player way
I can't get her out of my mind (wow)
I think about the girl all the time (wow wow)
East side to the west side
Pushin' phat rides, it's no surprise
She got tricks in the stash, stacking up the cash
Fast when it comes to the gas
By no means average
She's on when she's got to have it
Baby, you're a perfect ten, I wanna get in
Can I get down so I can win?
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, bag it up
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, bag it up, girl
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, bag it up
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, get up

She's got class and style
Street knowledge by the pound
Baby never act wild, very low key on the profile
Catchin' feelings is a no
Let me tell you how it goes
Herb's the word, spin's the verb
Lovers it curves so freak what you heard
Rollin' with the phatness
You don't even know what the half is
You gotta pay to play
Just for shorty, bang-bang, to look your way
I like the way you work it
Trump tight all day, every day
You're blowing my mind, maybe in time
Baby, I can get you in my ride
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, bag it up
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, oh yeah
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, bag it up, babe
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, get up

Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo (Hey yo, that girl looks good)
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo (Play on, play on, play on)
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo (You're my kind of girl)
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo (Hey yo)

'Cause that's my peeps and we rolls deep
Flyin' first class from New York City to Blackstreet
What you know about me? Not a motherfuckin' thing
Cartier wooden frames sported by my shorty
As for me, icy gleaming pinkie diamond ring
We be's the baddest clique up on the scene
Ain't you getting bored with these fake-ass broads?
I shows and proves, no doubt, I been diggin' you so
Please excuse, if I come across rude, that's just me
And that's how the playette's got to be
Stay kickin' game with a capital G
Ask the peoples on my block, I'm as real as can be
Word is bond, faking moves never been my thing
So, Teddy, pass the word to your nigga Chauncy
I be sending the call, let's say around 3:30
Queen Pen and Blackstreet, it's no diggity
No diggity, no doubt baby
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Girl, you got it going on)
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Play on, play on, play on)
(Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo) I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Hey, ooh)
(Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo) I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Hell, yeah, babe)

Yeah, come on
Maggie in full effect
Lisa in full effect (right)
Biggie in full effect (uh huh)
Tamika in full effect (yeah)
Blaze in full effect (right)
Ain't nothin' goin' on but the rent (no doubt)
Yeah, play on, playette

'Cause I like it (right)
No diggity, no doubt

We out, we out (right)
We out, we out

THIS IS HOW WE DO IT

(Background chatter)
This is how we do it!
(This is how we do it!)
Sha la la la la la lo
Shabada lo lo lo, whoa
(This is how we do it!)
Lo lo lo low-oh-oh

This is how we do it
It's Friday night, and I feel alright
The party is here on the West Side
So I reach for my 40 and I turn it up
Designated driver, take the keys to my truck
Hit the 'shaw cause I'm faded
Honies in the street say, "Monty, yo, we made it!"
It feels so good in my hood tonight
The summertime skirts and the guys in Kani
All the gangbangers forgot about the drive-by
You gotta get your groove on, before you go get paid
So tip up your cup and throw your hands up
And let me hear the party say

I'm kinda buzzed and it's all because (This is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does (This is how we do it)
To all my neighbors, you got much flavor (This is how we do it)
Let's flip the track, bring the old school back (this is how we do it)
This is how we do it, all hands are in the air
And wave them from here to there
If you're an O.G. mack or a wannabe player
You see the hood's been good to me
Ever since I was a lower-case g
But now I'm a big G
The girls see I got the money
Hundred-dollar bills, y'all
If you were from where I'm from then you would know
That I gotta get mine in a big black truck
You can get yours in a '64
Whatever it is, the party's underway
So tip up your cup and throw your hands up
And let me hear the party say...

I'm kinda buzzed and it's all because (This is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does (This is how we do it)
To all my neighbors you got much flavor (This is how we do it)
Let's flip the track, bring the old school back (This is how we do it)
I'm kinda buzzed and it's all because (This is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does (This is how we do it)
Y?N-Vee, SCC (This is how we do it)
I'll never come wack on an old school track (This is how we do it)
Check it out!
Once upon a time in '94
Montell made no money and life sure was slow
All they said was 6' 8" he stood
And people thought the music that he made was good
There lived a D.J. and Paul was his name
He came up to Monty, this is what he said
You and Oji are gonna make some cash
Sell a million records and we're makin' tha dash

Ohh, I'm buzzin' because... (This is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does (This is how we do it)
To all my neighbors you got much flavor (This is how we do it)
I'll never come wack on an old school track (This is how we do it)
I'm kinda buzzed and it's all because (This is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does (This is how we do it)

Oh, it's party time! (This is how we do it)
Straight up comin' from the West Side (This is how we do it)
OG's got the flavor, yeah (This is how we do it)
And Monty does it like nobody does (This is how we do it)
C'mon now, Def Jam, you know what it is (This is how we do it)
Yo Montell, this Percy, man
The barber, your barber
Man I'm sitting up here listening to ya tape, dude
And this shit is on, man
You gon' make it, fool
Keep on doing what you doing, man
My phone number is area code
Nine oh nine, zero, eighty-
Gimme a call, man
We getting ready to step out to the Fox Hills Mall right now
But, uh
It's Monday morning, about a quarter to eleven, peace
***************

IT WASN'T ME

Yo, man
Yo
Open up, man
Yo, what you want, man?
My girl just caught me
You made her catch you?
I don't know how I let this happen
With who?
The girl next door, ya know?
Man...
I don't know what to do
Say it wasn't you
Alright

Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creepin' with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt naked
Bangin' on the bathroom floor
How could I forget that I had
Given her an extra key?
All this time she was standin' there
She never took her eyes off me

How ya fi give the woman access to your villa?
Trespasser and a witness all the hacklin' a yuh pillow
You better watch your back before she turn into a killa
Best review the situation that you caught up inna
To be a true player you haffi know how fi play
If she say, “a night”, convince her, say, “a day”
Never admit to a word when she say
And if she claim a yuh, tell her, “Baby, no way!”
But she caught me on the counter (Wasn't me)
Saw me bangin' on the sofa (Wasn't me)
I even had her in the shower (Wasn't me)
She even caught me on camera (Wasn't me)
She saw the marks on my shoulder (Wasn't me)
Heard the words that I told her (Wasn't me)
Heard the screams gettin' louder (Wasn't me)
She stayed until it was over

Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creepin' with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt naked
Bangin' on the bathroom floor
I had tried to keep her from what
She was about to see
Why should she believe me
When I told her it wasn't me?

Make she know say that she really no have right fi vex
A never you she see yah make the gigolo flex
A smaddy else weh favor you inna di complex
Seein' is believin', so you better change your specs
You know she a go bring a whole heap a things up from the past
All the likkle evidence, you betta know fi mask
Quick 'pon yuh answer, know how fi talk
But if she pack a gun, you know you betta run fast
But she caught me on the counter (Wasn't me)
Saw me bangin' on the sofa (Wasn't me)
I even had her in the shower (It wasn't me)
She even caught me on camera (Wa-wasn't me)
She saw the marks on my shoulder (Wasn't me)
Heard the words that I told her (Wasn't me)
Heard the screams gettin' louder (Wasn't me)
She stayed until it was over

Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creepin' with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt naked
Bangin' on the bathroom floor
How could I forget that I had
Given her an extra key?
All this time she was standin' there
She never took her eyes off me

Wanna tell her that I'm sorry
For the pain that I've caused
I've been listenin' to your reasonin'
It makes no sense at all
Need to tell her that I'm sorry
For the pain that I've caused
You may think that you're a player
But you're completely lost
That's why I sing
Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creepin' with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt naked
Bangin' on the bathroom floor
How could I forget that I had
Given her an extra key?
All this time she was standin' there
She never took her eyes off me

WATERFALLS

A lonely mother gazing out of the window
Staring at a son that she just can't touch
If at any time, he's in a jam, she'll be by his side
But he doesn't realize he hurts her so much
But all the praying just ain't helping at all
'Cause he can't seem to keep hisself out of trouble
So he goes out and he makes his money the best way he knows how
Another body laying cold in the gutter
Listen to me

Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast
Little precious has a natural obsession for temptation
But he just can't see
She gives him loving that his body can't handle
But all he can say is, "Baby, it's good to me"
One day, he goes and takes a glimpse in the mirror
But he doesn't recognize his own face
His health is fading, and he doesn't know why
Three letters took him to his final resting place
Y'all don't hear me
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
(Your way or no way)
But I think you're moving too fast

Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast

Come on!
I seen a rainbow yesterday, but too many storms
Have come and gone, leaving a trace of not one God-given ray
Is it because my life is ten shades of gray, I pray
All ten fade away, seldom praise Him for the sunny days
And like His promise is true, only my faith can undo
The many chances I blew to bring my life to anew
Clear blue and unconditional skies
Have dried the tears from my eyes, no more lonely cries
My only bleeding hope is for the folk who can't cope
With such an endurin' pain that it keeps 'em in the pourin' rain
Who's to blame for tooting 'caine into your own vein?
What a shame, you shoot and aim for someone else's brain
You claim the insane, and name this day in time
For falling prey to crime
I say the system's got you victim to your own mind
Dreams are hopeless aspirations in hopes of coming true
Believe in yourself, the rest is up to me and you
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast

Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're movin' too fast (Ooh, you're movin' too fast)

Don't go chasing waterfalls (Don't go, don't go)
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
(I know, I know, your way hey)
But I think you're moving too fast

EVERYTHING YOU WANT

Somewhere there's speaking
It's already coming in
Oh and it's rising at the back of your mind
You never could get it
Unless you were fed it
Now you're here and you don't know why
But under skinned knees and the skid marks
Past the places where you used to learn
You howl and listen
Listen and wait for the
Echoes of angels who won't return

He's everything you want
He's everything you need
He's everything inside of you
That you wish you could be
He says all the right things
At exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you
And you don't know why

You're waiting for someone
To put you together
You're waiting for someone to push you away
There's always another wound to discover
There's always something more you wish he'd say
He's everything you want
He's everything you need
He's everything inside of you
That you wish you could be
He says all the right things
At exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you
And you don't know why

But you'll just sit tight
And watch it unwind
It's only what you're asking for
And you'll be just fine
With all of your time
It's only what you're waiting for

Out of the island
Into the highway
Past the places where you might have turned
You never did notice
But you still hide away
The anger of angels who won't return
He's everything you want
He's everything you need
He's everything inside of you
That you wish you could be
He says all the right things
At exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you
And you don't know why

I am everything you want
I am everything you need
I am everything inside of you
That you wish you could be
I say all the right things
At exactly the right time
But I mean nothing to you and I don't know why
And I don't know why
Why
I don't know
***************

SLIDE

Could you whisper in my ear?
The things you wanna feel
I'd give you anything
To feel it comin'
Do you wake up on your own
And wonder where you are?
You live with all your faults

I wanna wake up where you are
I won't say anything at all
So why don't you slide?
Yeah, I'm gonna let it slide

Don't you love the life you killed?
The priest is on the phone
Your father hit the wall
Your ma disowned you
I don't suppose I'll ever know
What it means to be a man
Or something I can just change
I live around it

I wanna wake up where you are
I won't say anything at all
So why don't you slide
Ooh, slide
And I'll do anything you ever dreamed to be complete
Little pieces of the nothing that fall
Oh, May
Put your arms around me
What you feel is what you are
And what you are is beautiful
Oh, May
Do you wanna get married
Or run away?

Ooh, oohoo

And I'll do anything you ever dreamed to be complete
Little pieces of the nothin' that fall
Oh, May
Put your arms around me
What you feel is what you are
And what you are is beautiful
Oh, May
Do you wanna get married
Or run away?

I wanna wake up where you are
And I won't say anything
(Yeah, slide)
And I'll do anything you ever dreamed to be complete
(Yeah, slide)
Little pieces of the nothing that fall
Ohh, May
(Yeah, slide)

(Yeah, slide)
And I'll do anything you ever dreamed to be complete
(Yeah, slide)
Little pieces of the nothing that fall
Ohh ohh, oh May

Yeah, slide between the sheets
Of all them beds you never knew
(Yeah, slide)
Why don't you slide into my room
Just slide into my room
And ah we'll run away
Run away, run away

GOT 'TIL IT'S GONE

What’s, what’s the next song?
The one about me
Oh, yeah, I like this… like Joni says

Don’t it always seem to go
That you don’t know what you’ve got til it’s
Don’t it always seem to go
That you don’t know what you’ve got til it’s
Don’t it always seem to go
That you don’t know what you’ve got til it’s
That you don’t know what you’ve got til it’s gone

Have a feeling, now believing that you
Were the one I was meant to be with
Oh how I’m wishing, thinking, dreaming
Bout you, and the love
How’d I ever let you get away

Don’t it always seem
Don’t it always seem
Don’t it always seem
Don’t it always seem
Don’t it always seem to go
That you don’t know what you’ve got til it’s gone
Don’t it always seem to go
That you don’t know what you’ve got til it’s gone
Don’t it always seem to go
That you don’t know what you’ve got til it’s gone
Joni Mitchell never lies
That you don’t know what you’ve got til it’s gone

If I could turn back the hands of time
Make you, fall in love, in love with me again
So would you give me another chance to love
To love you, love you the right way, no games
Got until it's gone
Got until it's gone
Joni Mitchel never lies

Don’t it always seem to go
That you don’t know what you’ve got til it’s gone
Don’t it always seem to go
That you don’t know what you’ve got til it’s
Don’t it always seem to go
That you don’t know what you’ve got til...
One two, one two, yo
Let me just fuck with it for a minute, what
(that you don't what you've got til it's gone)
Now you realizing when them nights go long, right
Campaign for me to stay when you know that I’m gone, right
You act all wild, when I tell you to settle
I was working round the clock, but your girls want to meddle
Talk about I heard he swims with this chick on the beach
That was out with the tide but my love you impeach
Now you looking at the walls, head in hands, cold jonezin

Don’t it always seem to go

Don’t it always seem to go

Don’t it always seem to go
That you don’t know what you’ve got til it’s gone
Joni Mitchell never lies

Yo, do you feel that?

ALWAYS BE MY BABY

We were as one, babe
For a moment in time
And it seemed everlasting
That you would always be mine
Now you want to be free
So I'll let you fly
'Cause I know in my heart, babe
Our love will never die, no

You'll always be a part of me
I'm part of you indefinitely
Boy, don't you know you can't escape me?
Ooh, darling, 'cause you'll always be my baby
And we'll linger on
Time can't erase a feeling this strong
No way you're never gonna shake me
Ooh, darling, 'cause you'll always be my baby

I ain't gonna cry, no
And I won't beg you to stay
If you're determined to leave, boy
I will not stand in your way
But inevitably
You'll be back again
'Cause you know in your heart, babe
Our love will never end, no
You'll always be a part of me
I'm part of you indefinitely
Boy, don't you know you can't escape me?
Ooh, darling, 'cause you'll always be my baby
And we'll linger on
Time can't erase a feeling this strong
No way you're never gonna shake me
Ooh, darling, 'cause you'll always be my baby

I know that you'll be back, boy
When your days and your nights get a little bit colder, oh
I know that you'll be right back, baby
Oh, baby, believe me, it's only a matter of time, time

You'll always be a part of me
I'm part of you indefinitely
Boy, don't you know you can't escape me?

No way you're never going to shake me (you and I)
Ooh, darling, 'cause you'll always be my baby
You and I will always be
No way you're never gonna shake me
No way you're never gonna shake me
You and I will always be

KILLING ME SOFTLY WITH HIS SONG

Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song

(Ah!) Yooo! (Yeah! Yeah!)
This is Wyclef, Refugee Camp (L-Boogie up in here)
Pra'zrel, (Pra'zrel up in here! Ha! Ha!)
Lil' Base sits up there on the base (Refugees up in here)
While I'm on this... I got my girl L (Ah, ah)
One time (One time), one time, (One time)
Ayo, L, you know you got the lyrics

I heard he sang a good song
I heard he had a style
And so I came to see him
And listen for a while
And there he was
This young boy, stranger to my eyes

Strumming my pain with his fingers (One time, one time)
Singing my life with his words (Two times, two times)
Killing me softly with this song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
I felt all flushed with fever
Embarrassed by the crowd
I felt he found my letters
Then read each one out loud
I prayed that he would finish
But he just kept right on

Strumming my pain with his fingers (One time, one time)
Singing my life with his words (Two times, two times)
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song

Yo, L-Boog, take me to the bridge

Woah
Woah-oah-ah-ah-ah uh, uh
La-la-la, la, la, la
Woah, la
Woah, la (Ha, ha, ha, ha)
Laaaa
Strumming my pain with his fingers (Yes, he was singing)
Yes he was singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Strumming my pain, yeah (Strumming my pain)

Yo, put your hands together for L-Boogie from the Refugee Camp (Yeah, yeah)
(Singing my life)
Up in here, you know how we do, L-Boogie up in here
Wyclef, Pra'zrel, said L-Boogie up in here
Wyclef up in here
My man Lil' Base (Pra'zrel up in here)
Jerry one time (T Rocks up in here, we got Warren up in here)
This is how we— (Warren up, up in here, Outsiders up here)
Refugee Camp, Refugee Camp (We got Fallon up in here, Mulaney, Mulaney's up in here, we got Val' up in here)

Everybody got a breaking point, kid, and they'll rat on you
The family niggas'll rat on you
That's why we gotta be prepared to take out whoever we need to (Man, motherfucker, I told you I was gonna get you next)

PEACHES

Movin' to the country
I'm gonna eat a lot of peaches
Movin' to the country
I'm gonna eat me a lot of peaches
Movin' to the country
I'm gonna eat a lot of peaches
Movin' to the country
I'm gonna eat a lot of peaches

Peaches come from a can
They were put there by a man
In a factory downtown
If I had my little way
I'd eat peaches every day
Sun-soakin' bulges in the shade

Movin' to the country
I'm gonna eat a lot of peaches
Movin' to the country
I'm gonna eat me a lot of peaches
Movin' to the country
I'm gonna eat a lot of peaches
Movin' to the country
I'm gonna eat a lot of peaches
I took a little nap where the roots all twist
Squished a rotten peach in my fist
And dreamed about you, woman
I poked my finger down inside
Make a little room for an ant to hide
Nature's candy in my hand or can or a pie

Millions of peaches, peaches for me
Millions of peaches, peaches for free
Millions of peaches, peaches for me
Millions of peaches, peaches for free (Look out!)
Millions of peaches, peaches for me
Millions of peaches, peaches for free
Millions of peaches, peaches for me
Millions of peaches, peaches for free
Millions of peaches, peaches for me
Millions of peaches, peaches for free
Millions of peaches, peaches for me
Millions of peaches, peaches for free (Look out!)

1979

Shakedown 1979
Cool kids never have the time
On a live wire right up off the street
You and I should meet
Junebug skippin' like a stone
With the headlights pointed at the dawn
We were sure we'd never see an end
To it all

And I don't even care
To shake these zipper blues
And we don't know
Just where our bones will rest
To dust I guess
Forgotten and absorbed
Into the earth below

Double-cross the vacant and the bored
They're not sure just what we have in store
Morphine city slippin' dues
Down to see

That we don't even care
As restless as we are
We feel the pull
In the land of a thousand guilts
And poured cement
Lamented and assured
To the lights and towns below
Faster than the speed of sound
Faster than we thought we'd go
Beneath the sound of hope

Justine never knew the rules
Hung down with the freaks and ghouls
No apologies ever need be made
I know you better than you fake it
To see

That we don't even care
To shake these zipper blues
And we don't know
Just where our bones will rest
To dust I guess
Forgotten and absorbed
Into the earth below

The street heats the urgency of now
As you see there's no one around

CHANGES

Ooh, yeah (Ooh)
(Come on, come on)

I see no changes, wake up in the morning and I ask myself
Is life worth livin'? Should I blast myself?
I'm tired of bein' poor and, even worse, I'm black
My stomach hurts so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch
Cops give a damn about a negro
Pull the trigger, kill a nigga, he's a hero
"Give the crack to the kids, who the hell cares?
One less hungry mouth on the welfare"
First ship 'em dope and let 'em deal to brothers
Give 'em guns, step back, watch 'em kill each other
"It's time to fight back," that's what Huey said
Two shots in the dark, now Huey's dead
I got love for my brother
But we can never go nowhere unless we share with each other
We gotta start makin' changes
Learn to see me as a brother instead of two distant strangers
And that's how it's supposed to be
How can the Devil take a brother if he's close to me? Uh
I'd love to go back to when we played as kids
But things change, and that's the way it is
(Come on, come on)
That's just the way it is (Changes)
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is (That's the way it is, what?)
Aww, yeah-yeah (Hear me)
(Oh my, oh my, come on, come on)
That's just the way it is (That's just the way it is, the way it is)
Things'll never be the same
(Never be the same, yeah, yeah, yeah, aww, yeah)
That's just the way it is (Way it is)
Aww, yeah (Come on, come on)
I see no changes, all I see is racist faces
Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
We under, I wonder what it takes to make this
One better place, let's erase the wasted
Take the evil out the people, they'll be actin' right
'Cause both black and white are smokin' crack tonight
And the only time we chill is when we kill each other (Kill each other)
It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other
And although it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready to see a black president, uh (Oh-ooh)
It ain't a secret, don't conceal the fact
The penitentiary's packed and it's filled with blacks
But some things will never change (Never change)
Try to show another way, but you stayin' in the dope game (Ooh)
Now tell me, what's a mother to do?
Bein' real don't appeal to the brother in you (Yeah)
You gotta operate the easy way
"I made a G today," but you made it in a sleazy way
Sellin' crack to the kids (Oh-oh), "I gotta get paid" (Oh)
Well hey, well that's the way it is
(Come on, come on)
That's just the way it is (Changes)
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is (That's the way it is, what?)
Aww, yeah (Hear me)
(Oh my, oh my, come on, come on)
That's just the way it is (That's just the way it is, the way it is)
Things'll never be the same
(Never be the same, yeah, yeah, yeah, aww, yeah)
That's just the way it is (Way it is)
Aww, yeah (Aww, yeah, aww, yeah)

We gotta make a change
It's time for us as a people to start makin' some changes
Let's change the way we eat
Let's change the way we live
And let's change the way we treat each other
You see, the old way wasn't workin'
So it's on us to do what we gotta do to survive

And still I see no changes, can't a brother get a little peace?
It's war on the streets and the war in the Middle East (Ooh, yeah)
Instead of war on poverty
They got a war on drugs so the police can bother me
And I ain't never did a crime I ain't have to do
But now I'm back with the facts, givin' it back to you (Ooh)
Don't let 'em jack you up, back you up
Crack you up and pimp-smack you up
You gotta learn to hold your own
They get jealous when they see you with your mobile phone
But tell the cops they can't touch this
I don't trust this, when they try to rush, I bust this
That's the sound of my tool, you say it ain't cool
My mama didn't raise no fool (Oh)
And as long as I stay black, I gotta stay strapped
And I never get to lay back
'Cause I always got to worry 'bout the payback
Some buck that I roughed up way back
Comin' back after all these years
"Rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat," that's the way it is
(Uh)
That's just the way it is (Just the way it is, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Things'll never be the same (Yeah)
That's just the way it is (The way it is)
Aww, yeah (Some things will never change, oh my)
(I'm tryna make a change)
(You're my brother, you're my sister, yeah)
That's just the way it is (The way it is, the way it is)
Things'll never be the same (You're my brother, you're my sister)
That's just the way it is, aww, yeah
Some things'll never change

THERE SHE GOES

There she goes
There she goes again
Racing through my brain
And I just can't contain
This feeling that remains
There she goes
There she goes again
Pulsing through my veins
And I just can't contain
This feeling that remains
There she goes (there she goes again)
There she goes again (there she goes again)
Racing through my brain (there she goes again)
And I just can't contain
This feeling that remains

There she goes
There she goes again
She calls my name
Pulls my train
No one else could heal my pain
And I just can't contain
This feeling that remains
There she goes (she calls my name)
There she goes again (she calls my name)
Chasing down my lane (she calls my name)
And I just can't contain
This feeling that remains
There she goes (there she goes again)
There she goes (there she goes again)
There she goes

WHEN I COME AROUND

Well, I heard you crying loud
All the way across town
You've been searching for that someone and it's me out on the prowl
As you sit around feeling sorry for yourself
Well, don't get lonely now
And dry your whining eyes
I'm just roamin' for the moment, sleazin' my backyard, so don't get
So uptight, you've been thinking about ditching me

No time to search the world around
'Cause you know where I'll be found
When I come around

Oh, I heard it all before
So don't knock down my door
I'm a loser and a user, so I don't need no accuser
To try and slag me down because I know you're right
So go do what you like
Make sure you do it wise
You may find out that your self-doubt means nothing was ever there
You can't go forcing something if it's just not right

No time to search the world around
'Cause you know where I'll be found
When I come around

No time to search the world around
'Cause you know where I'll be found
When I come around
When I come around
When I come around
When I come around

Well, if you battle me, I will revile
People always saying my style is wild
You've got gall, you've got guile (guile)

Too sweet to be sour; too nice to be mean
Well, on the tough guy style, I'm not too keen
Trying to change the world, I will plot and scheme

WHAT'S MY AGE AGAIN?

I took her out, it was a Friday night
I wore cologne to get the feeling right
We started making out and she took off my pants
But then I turned on the TV

And that's about the time she walked away from me
Nobody likes you when you're twenty-three
And are still more amused by TV shows
What the hell is ADD?
My friends say I should act my age
What's my age again? What's my age again?

Then later on, on the drive home
I called her mom from a payphone
I said I was the cops and your husband's in jail
This state looks down on sodomy

And that's about the time that bitch hung up on me
Nobody likes you when you're twenty-three
And are still more amused by prank phone calls
What the hell is call ID?
My friends say I should act my age
What's my age again? What's my age again?

And that's about the time she walked away from me
Nobody likes you when you're twenty-three
And you still act like you're in freshman year
What the hell is wrong with me?
My friends say I should act my age
(What's my age again? What's my age again?)
That's about the time that she broke up with me (Please stay with me)
No one should take themselves so seriously (Please stay with me)
With many years ahead to fall in line (Please stay with me)
Why would you wish that on me?
(Please stay) I never wanna act my age
(With) What's my age again? (Me) What's my age again?

What's my age again?

Sometimes I feel like I don't have a partner
Sometimes I feel like my only friend
Is the city I live in, The City of Angels
Lonely as I am together we cry

I drive on her streets 'cause she's my companion
I walk through her hills 'cause she knows who I am
She sees my good deeds and she kisses me windy
Well, I never worry, now that is a lie

I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
But take me to the place I love, take me all the way
I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
But take me to the place I love take me all the way

Yeah, yeah yeah

It's hard to believe that there's nobody out there
It's hard to believe that I'm all alone

GOOD RIDDANCE

Another turning point, a fork stuck in the road
Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go
So make the best of this test and don't ask why
It's not a question, but a lesson learned in time

It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right
I hope you had the time of your life

So take the photographs and still frames in your mind
Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time
Tattoos of memories and dead skin on trial
For what it's worth it was worth all the while

It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right
I hope you had the time of your life

So make the best of this test and don't ask why
It's not a question but another lesson learned in time

It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right
I hope you had the time of your life

But then my chance to get to Heaven slipped
I used to worry about the future
But then I threw my caution to the wind
I had no reason to be carefree - no, no, no
'Til I took a trip to the other side of town - yeah, yeah, yeah
You know I heard that boogie rhythm
Hey! I had no choice but to get down, down, down, down

Dance!
Nothing left for me to do but dance
Off these bad times I'm going through, just dance
Got canned heat in my heels, tonight, baby

I feel the thunder, see the lightning
I know this anger's Heaven-sent
So I've got to hang out all my hang-ups
'Cause of the boogie, I feel so Hell-bent, hey, hey
It's just an instant gut reaction, that I got
I know I've never, ever felt like this before
I don't know what to do
But then that's nothing new
Stuck between Hell and high water, need a cure to make it through, hey!
Dance, yeah, nothing left for me to do but dance
Of these bad times I'm going through, just dance, hey
Got canned heat in my heels, tonight, baby
You know, know, know I'm gonna dance, yeah
Off the nasty things that people say, dance, yeah
But I'm gonna make it anyway
Dance, got canned heat in my heels tonight, baby
You know I got canned heat in my heels
You know this boogie is for real

Only the wind can know the answer
And she cries to me when I'm asleep
She says you know that you can go much faster
I know that people's talk can be so cheap, hey, hey
I've got this voodoo child in-veined on me
I'm gonna use my power to ascend
You know I've got these running heels to use
Sometimes there's no way I lose
I was born to run and built to last
You never see my feet 'cause they move so fast

Dance, yeah, nothing left for me to do but dance
Off these bad times I'm going through, just dance, hey
Got canned heat in my heels, tonight, baby
Hey, I've got to dance, yeah
Off the nasty things that people say, dance, yeah
But I'm gonna make it anyway
Dance, got canned heat in my heels tonight, baby
You know this boogie is for real
Got so much canned heat in my heels, yeah
Gonna dance, gonna dance my blues away tonight
You know I'm gonna dance my blues away
You know this boogie is for real
Got so much canned heat in my heels, yeah
Gonna dance, gonna dance my blues away tonight
Dance, come on! Got canned heat in my heels tonight
Dance! Canned heat in my heels tonight
Dance! (Alright) Canned heat in my heels tonight, baby
Hey, got so much
Dance!
Hey, DJ, let the music play (Let the music play, yeah)
I'm gonna live this party life (I wanna live this party life)
Hey, DJ, throw my cares away (Let the music play, yeah)
I'm gonna live this party life (I wanna live this party life)
Hey, DJ, let the music play (I wanna live this party life)
I'm gonna live this party life (I wanna live this party life)
Hey, DJ, let the music play (Party life, party life)
I'm gonna live this party life (I wanted, I wanted to go home)

You know that this boogie is for real (Dance!)
Got so much canned heat in my heels (Dance!)
Gonna dance, gonna dance my blues away tonight (Dance!)
You know, you know this boogie, this boogie is for real (Dance!)
Got so much canned heat, canned heat in my heels (Dance!)
You know, I'm gonna dance my blues away tonight (Dance!)

BULLET WITH BUTTERFLY WINGS

The world is a vampire
Sent to drain
Secret destroyers
Hold you up to the flames
And what do I get
For my pain?
Betrayed desires
And a piece of the game

Even though I know
I suppose I'll show
All my cool and cold
Like ol' Job
Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage
Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage
Someone will say, "What is lost can never be saved."
Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage

Now I'm naked
Nothing but an animal
But can you fake it
For just one more show?
And what do you want?
I wanna change
What do you got
When you feel the same?
Even though I know
I suppose I'll show
All my cool and cold
Like ol' Job

Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage
Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage
Then someone will say, "What is lost can never be saved."
Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage
Tell me I'm the only one
Tell me there's no other one
Jesus was an only son, yeah
Tell me I'm the chosen one
Jesus was an only son, for you

Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage
Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage
And someone will say, "What is lost can never be saved."
Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage!

Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a…
Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a…
Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage
Tell me I'm the only one
Tell me there's no other one
Jesus was an only son, for you

And I still believe that I cannot be saved
And I still believe that I cannot be saved
And I still believe that I cannot be saved
And I still believe that I cannot be saved

ALL STAR

Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
In the shape of an "L" on her forehead

Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the backstreets?
You'll never know if you don't go
You'll never shine if you don't glow

Hey now, you're an all star
Get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star
Get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold
It's a cool place, and they say it gets colder
You're bundled up now, wait 'til you get older
But the meteor men beg to differ
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
The water's getting warm so you might as well swim
My world's on fire, how 'bout yours?
That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored
Hey now, you're an all star
Get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star
Get the show on, get paid
All that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

Go for the moon
Go for the moon
Go for the moon
Go for the moon

Hey now, you're an all star
Get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star
Get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars
Somebody once asked, "could I spare some change for gas?
I need to get myself away from this place"
I said, "Yep, what a concept
I could use a little fuel myself and we could all use a little change"
Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the backstreets?
You'll never know if you don't go (Go!)
You'll never shine if you don't glow

Hey now, you're an all star
Get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star
Get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

And all that glitters is gold

LOSER

In the time of chimpanzees, I was a monkey
Butane in my veins and I'm out to cut the junkie
With the plastic eyeballs, spray-paint the vegetables
Dog food stalls with the beefcake pantyhose
Kill the headlights and put it in neutral
Stock car flaming with the loser in the cruise control
Baby's in Reno with the vitamin D
Got a couple of couches, sleep on the love-seat
Someone came in saying I'm insane to complain
About a shotgun wedding and a stain on my shirt
Don't believe everything that you breathe
You get a parking violation and a maggot on your sleeve
So shave your face with some mace in the dark
Saving all your food stamps and burning down the trailer park
Yo, cut it

Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me?
(Double barrel buckshot)
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me?

The forces of evil in a bozo nightmare
Ban all the music with the phony gas chamber
'Cause one's got a weasel and the other's got a flag
One's on the pole, shove the other in a bag
With the rerun shows and the cocaine nose-job
The daytime crap of the folksinger slob
He hung himself with a guitar string
A slab of turkey-neck and it's hanging from a pigeon wing
You can't write if you can't relate
Trade the cash for the beat for the body for the heat
And my time is a piece of wax falling on a termite
Who's choking on the splinters
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me?
(Get crazy with the cheese whiz)
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me?
(Drive-by body pierce)

(Yo, bring it on down)
I'm a driver, I'm a winner
Things are gonna change, I can feel it

Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me?
(I can't believe you)
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me?
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me?
(Sprechen Sie Deutsch, eh, baby?)
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me?
(Know what I'm sayin'?)

LUMP

Lump sat alone in a boggy marsh
Totally emotionless except for her heart
Mud flowed up into lump's pajamas
She totally confused all the passing piranhas

She's lump, she's lump
She's in my head
She's lump, she's lump, she's lump
She might be dead

Lump lingered last in line for brains
And the one she got was sorta rotten and insane
Small things so sad that birds could land
Is lump fast asleep or rockin' out with the band?

She's lump, she's lump
She's in my head
She's lump, she's lump, she's lump
She might be dead

Ba baw
Ba ba banana
Ba baw
Ba ba banana
Ba baw
Ba ba banana
Ba baw
Lump was limp and lonely and needed a shove
Lump slipped on a kiss and tumbled into love
She spent her twenties between the sheets
Life limped along at sub-sonic speeds

She's lump, she's lump
She's in my head
She's lump, she's lump, she's lump
She might be dead
Woo!

Is this lump outta my head?
I think so
Is this lump outta my head?
I think so
Is this lump outta my head?
I think so
Is this lump outta my head?

ALL THE SMALL THINGS

All the small things
True care, truth brings
I'll take one lift
Your ride, best trip
Always, I know
You'll be at my show
Watching, waiting
Commiserating

Say it ain't so, I will not go
Turn the lights off, carry me home

Na na, na na, na na, na na, na, na
Na na, na na, na na, na na, na, na
Na na, na na, na na, na na, na, na
Na na, na na, na na, na na, na, na

Late night, come home
Work sucks, I know
She left me roses by the stairs
Surprises let me know she cares
Just say it ain't so, I will not go
Turn the lights off, carry me home

Na na, na na, na na, na na, na, na
Na na, na na, na na, na na, na, na

Turn the lights off, carry me home
Keep your head still, I'll be your thrill
The night will go on, my little windmill

(Na na, na na, na na, na na, na, na)
Say it ain't so, I will not go

Turn the lights off, carry me home

THE KING OF WISHFUL THINKING

Uh
Uh
Let's Go

I think I'm leaving
I'm getting up outta here
No fucks given
Fresh up outta fear
Gone
Love me or leave me alone
Respected and protected
Always reppin' my home
I mean
Who rep harder than me?
Turn ya doubts to my dreams
Take them farther than me?
I'm a starter you dweebs
And I ain't got the time
To go and tip toe the lines
Never be a martyr for the
Nope
Fistful of dreams, glass full of Honey Jack
Visualizations sit back let the money stack
Where I'm from? I get plenty of hate
So it's no wonder why I had to plan the escape. I'm out

I think I'm leaving
I'm getting up outta here
No fucks given
Fresh up outta fear
I think I'm leaving
This time I gotta go
I'll be back one day you already know
I think I'm leaving
I'm getting up outta here
First time in awhile I'm seeing things clear
And if you can't respect that
Ya whole perspective is whack
Maybe they'll love me when I fade to black

Back home, everyone bout' to blow next
Fuck this
I'll take my talents and Go West
Yes, the 'king of wishful thinking'
Maybe get a job, a place, and try to stop drinking, syke!
Just pour another glass
Start tomorrow instead
Maybe take another pass
That's just me
You know
Tryna break free
Of feeling proud and annoyed
Simultaneously
Watch, listen
I been around like a sting
Dudes frontin' over nothing
Whats a pawn to a king?
Or what's a queen to a pawn
Tryna hold my yawns
Beantown state of mind
Where the trees are palm
They
Show you slugs before they show hugs
Never shown shit, now I gotta show love!?
Times changing
It's like I'm riding in Deloreans
I hope you fare well
Like a Valedictorian

Uh
Bargang
Young Kennedys
West Coast
Let's Go
Hear Em' ?

ICE ICE BABY

Yo VIP, let's kick it
Ice, ice, baby
Ice, ice, baby

Alright stop, collaborate and listen
Ice is back with a brand new invention
Something grabs a hold of me tightly
Flow like a harpoon daily and nightly
"Will it ever stop?" Yo, I don't know
Turn off the lights and I'll glow
To the extreme, I rock a mic like a vandal
Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle
Dance, rush the speaker that booms
I'm killing your brain like a poisonous mushroom
Deadly when I play a dope melody
Anything less than the best is a felony
Love it or leave it, you better gangway
You better hit the bullseye, the kid don't play
And if there was a problem, yo, I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it
Ice, ice, baby
Vanilla Ice, ice, baby
Vanilla Ice, ice, baby
Vanilla Ice, ice, baby
Now that the party is jumping
With the bass kicked in and the Vegas are pumping
Quick to the point to the point no faking
Cooking MCs like a pound of bacon
Burnin' them if you're not quick and nimble
I go crazy when I hear a cymbal
And a hi-hat with a souped up tempo
I'm on a roll, it's time to go solo
Rollin'
In my 5.0
With the rag-top down so my hair can blow
The girlies on standby waving just to say hi
“Did you stop?” No, I just drove by
Kept on pursuing to the next stop
I busted a left and I'm heading to the next block
The block was dead
Yo so I continued to A1A Beachfront Avenue
Girls were hot wearing less than bikinis
Rockman lovers driving Lamborghinis
Jealous 'cause I'm out getting mine
Shay with a gauge and Vanilla with a nine
Ready for the chumps on the wall
The chumps acting ill because they're full of eight ball
Gunshots raged out like a bell
I grabbed my nine all I heard were shells
Falling on the concrete real fast
Jumped in my car slammed on the gas
Bumper to bumper the avenue's packed
I'm trying to get away before the jackers jack
Police on the scene you know what I mean
They passed me up confronted all the dope fiends
If there was a problem yo I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it
Ice, ice, baby
Vanilla Ice, ice, baby
Vanilla Ice, ice, baby
Ice, ice, baby

Take heed 'cause I'm a lyrical poet
Miami's on the scene just in case you didn't know it
My town that created all the bass sound
Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground
'Cause my style's like a chemical spill
Feasible rhymes that you can vision and feel
Conducted and formed, this is a hell of a concept
We make it hype and you want to step
With this.  Shay plays on the fade
Slice like a ninja, cut like a razor blade
So fast, other DJs say, “Damn!”
If rhyme was a drug I'd sell it by the gram
Keep my composure when it's time to get loose
Magnetized by the mic while I kick my juice
If there was a problem yo I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it
Ice ice, baby
Vanilla Ice, ice, baby
Vanilla Ice, ice, baby
Ice ice, baby
Vanilla Ice
Yo man, let's get out of here
Word to your mother
Ice, ice, baby (Too cold)
Ice, ice, baby (Too cold)
Ice, ice, baby (Too cold)
Ice, ice, baby (Too cold, too cold)
Ice, ice, baby (Too cold, too cold)
Ice, ice, baby (Too cold, too cold)
Ice

YOU WERE MEANT FOR ME

I hear the clock, it's six A.M
I feel so far from where I've been
I got my eggs, I got my pancakes too
I got my maple syrup, everything but you
I break the yolks and make a smiley face
I kinda like it in my brand new place
Wipe the spots up off the mirror
Don't leave my keys in the door
I never put wet towels on the floor anymore 'cause

Dreams last so long
Even after you're gone
I know that you love me
And soon you will see
You were meant for me
And I was meant for you

I called my momma, she was out for a walk
Consoled a cup of coffee but it didn't wanna talk
So I picked up the paper, it was more bad news
More hearts being broken or people being used
Put on my coat in the pouring rain
I saw a movie and it just wasn't the same
'Cause it was happy or I was sad
And it made me miss you oh so bad 'cause
Dreams last for so long
Even after you're gone
And I know that you love me
And soon you will see
You were meant for me
And I was meant for you

I go about my business, I'm doing fine
Besides, what would I say if I had you on the line?
Same old story, not much to say
Hearts are broken, every day

I brush my teeth, I put the cap back on
I know you hate it when I leave the light on
I pick a book up and I turn the sheets down
And take a deep breath and a good look around
Put on my pj's and hop into bed
I'm half alive but I feel mostly dead
I try and tell myself it'll all be alright
I shouldn't think anymore tonight 'cause...

Dreams last so long
Even after you're gone
And I know that you love me
And soon you will see
You were meant for me
And I was meant for you
Yeah, you were meant for me
And I was meant for you

HIGH AND DRY

Two jumps in a week, I bet you
Think that's pretty clever, don't you, boy
Flying on your motorcycle
Watching all the ground beneath you drop
You'd kill yourself for recognition
Kill yourself to never, ever stop
You broke another mirror
You're turning into something you are not

Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry

Drying up in conversation
You will be the one who cannot talk
All your insides fall to pieces
You just sit there wishing you could still make love
They're the ones who'll hate you
When you think you've got the world all sussed out
They're the ones who'll spit at you
You will be the one screaming out
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry


Oh, it's the best thing that you've ever had
The best thing that you've ever, ever had
It's the best thing that you've ever had
The best thing you've had has gone away

So don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry

STILL D.R.E.

Yeah, nigga, we're still fuckin' wit' you
Still waters run deep
Still Snoop Dogg and D.R.E.
'99, nigga, guess who's back
Still, still doin' that shit, huh, Dre?
Oh for sho'
Yeah
Check me out
It's still Dre Day nigga, AK nigga
Though I've grown a lot, can't keep it home a lot
'Cause when I frequent the spots that I'm known to rock
You hear the bass from the truck when I'm on the block
Ladies they pay homage, but haters say Dre fell off
How? Nigga, my last album was The Chronic (Nigga)
They wanna know if he still got it
They say rap's changed, they wanna know how I feel about it
(If you ain't up on thangs)
Dr. Dre is the name, I'm ahead of my game
Still puffin' my leaves, still fuck with the beats
Still not lovin' police (Huh-uh)
Still rock my khakis with a cuff and a crease (For sho')
Still got love for the streets, reppin' 213 (For life)
Still the beats bang, still doin' my thang
Since I left ain't too much changed, still
I'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hittin' them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E.
I'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hittin' them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E.
Since the last time you heard from me I lost some friends
Well, hell, me and Snoop, we dippin' again
Kept my ear to the streets, signed Eminem
He's triple platinum, doin' 50 a week
Still, I stay close to the heat
And even when I was close to defeat, I rose to my feet
My life's like a soundtrack I wrote to the beat
Treat rap like Cali weed: I smoke 'til I'm 'sleep
Wake up in the A.M., compose a beat
I bring the fire 'til you're soakin' in your seat
It's not a fluke, it's been tried, I'm the truth
Since "Turn Out the Lights" from the World Class Wreckin Cru
I'm still at it, after mathematics
In the home of drive-bys and ak-matics
Swap meets, sticky green, and bad traffic
I dip through, then I give you (Still) D.R.E.
I'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hittin' them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E.
I'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hittin' them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E.
It ain't nothin' but more hot shit
Another classic CD for y'all to vibe with
Whether you're coolin' on the corner wit' your fly bitch (Biatch)
Laidback in the shack, play this track
I'm representin' for the gangstas all across the world
Still (Hittin' them corners in them low-lows, girl)
I'll break your neck, damn near put your face in your lap
Niggas try to be the king, but the ace is back
(So if you ain't up on thangs)
Dr. Dre be the name (What?), still runnin' the game
Still got it wrapped like a mummy
Still ain't trippin', love to see young blacks get money
Spend time out the hood, take they moms out the hood
Hit my boys off with jobs, no more livin' hard (Nah, nah)
Barbeques every day, drivin' fancy cars (Hey, hey)
Still gon' get mine regardless (Still)
I'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hittin' them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E.
I'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hittin' them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E.
I'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hittin' them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E.

Right back up in your mothafuckin' ass
9-5 plus four pennies, add that shit up
D.R.E. right back up on top of thangs
Smoke some wit' your Dogg
No stress, no seeds, no stems, no sticks!
Some of that real sticky-icky-icky
Ooh wee! Put it in the air!
Well, you's a fool, D-R, ha-ha

INSANE IN THE BRAIN

Who you trying to get crazy with ése?
Don't you know I'm loco?


To the one on the flamboyant tip
I'll just toss that ham in the frying pan
Like spam, get done when I come and slam
Damn, I feel like the Son of Sam
Don't make me wreck shit, hectic
Next get the chair got me going like General Electric
"Aaaant", the lights are blinking, I'm thinking
It's all over when I go out drinking
Ohh, making my mind slow
That's why I don't fuck with the big 4-O
Bro, I got to maintain
'Cause a nigga like me is going insane

Insane in the membrane
Insane in the brain!
Insane in the membrane
Insane in the brain!
Insane in the membrane
Crazy insane, got no brain!
Insane in the membrane
Insane in the brain!
Do my shit undercover, now it's time for the blubber
Blabber, to watch that belly get fatter
Fat boy on a diet, don't try it
I'll jack yo' ass like a looter in a riot
My shit's fat, like a sumo, slamming dat ass
Leavin your face in the grass
'Cause you know, I don't take a duro, lightly
Punks just jealous 'cause they can't outwrite me
Or kick that style, wicked, wild
Happy face nigga never seen me smile
Rip that mainframe, I'll explain
A nigga like me is going insane

Insane in the membrane
Insane in the brain!
Insane in the membrane
Insane in the brain!
Insane in the membrane
Crazy insane, got no brain!
Insane in the membrane
Insane in the brain!

Like Louie Armstrong, played the trumpet
I'll hit that bong and break you off something
Soon I got to get my props
Cops, come and try to snatch my crops
These pigs wanna blow my house down
Head underground to the next town
They get mad when they come to raid my pad
And I'm out in the nine-deuce Cad'
Yes I'm the pirate, pilot
Of this ship if I get with the ultraviolet dream
Hide from the red light beam
Now do you believe in the unseen?
Look, but don't make you eyes strain
A nigga like me is going insane

Insane in the membrane
Insane in the brain!
Insane in the membrane
Insane in the brain!
Insane in the membrane
Crazy insane, got no brain!
Insane in the membrane

BLACK HOLE SUN

In my eyes, indisposed
In disguises no one knows
Hides the face, lies the snake
In the sun in my disgrace
Boiling heat, summer stench
'Neath the black the sky looks dead
Call my name through the cream
And I'll hear you scream again

Black hole sun, won't you come
And wash away the rain?
Black hole sun, won't you come?
Won't you come? Won't you come?

Stuttering, cold and damp
Steal the warm wind, tired friend
Times are gone for honest men
And sometimes far too long for snakes
In my shoes, a walking sleep
And my youth I pray to keep
Heaven send Hell away
No one sings like you anymore
Black hole sun,  won't you come
And wash away the rain?
Black hole sun, won't you come?
Won't you come?
Black hole sun,  won't you come
And wash away the rain?
Black hole sun, won't you come?
Won't you come?

Black hole sun, black hole sun
Won't you come?
Black hole sun, black hole sun
Won't you come?
Black hole sun, black hole sun
Won't you come?
Black hole sun, black hole sun


Hang my head, drown my fear
'Til you all just disappear

Black hole sun,  won't you come
And wash away the rain?
Black hole sun, won't you come?
Won't you come?
Black hole sun,  won't you come
And wash away the rain?
Black hole sun, won't you come?
Won't you come?
Black hole sun, black hole sun
Won't you come?
Black hole sun, black hole sun
Won't you come?
Black hole sun, black hole sun
Won't you come?
Black hole sun, black hole sun
Won't you come?
Black hole sun, black hole sun
Won't you come?
Black hole sun, black hole sun

IRIS

And I'd give up forever to touch you
'Cause I know that you feel me somehow
You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be
And I don't wanna go home right now

And all I can taste is this moment
And all I can breathe is your life
And sooner or later, it's over
I just don't wanna miss you tonight

And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming
Or the moment of truth in your lies
When everything feels like the movies
Yeah, you bleed just to know you're alive

And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

DON'T LOOK BACK IN ANGER

Slip inside the eye of your mind
Don't you know you might find
A better place to play?
You said that you'd never been
But all the things that you've seen
Slowly fade away

So I start a revolution from my bed
'Cause you said the brains I had went to my head
Step outside, summertime's in bloom
Stand up beside the fireplace
Take that look from off your face
You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out

And so, Sally can wait
She knows it's too late as we're walking on by
Her soul slides away
But don't look back in anger, I heard you say

Take me to the place where you go
Where nobody knows if it's night or day
Please don't put your life in the hands
Of a rock 'n' roll band
Who'll throw it all away
I'm gonna start a revolution from my bed
'Cause you said the brains I had went to my head
Step outside, 'cause summertime's in bloom
Stand up beside the fireplace
Take that look from off your face
'Cause you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out

And so, Sally can wait
She knows it's too late as she's walking on by
My soul slides away
But don't look back in anger, I heard you say

"I'll always be there when you wake"
You know, I'd like to keep my cheeks dry today
So stay with me and I'll have it made (I'll have it made)

And I don't understand why I sleep all day
And I start to complain that there's no rain
And all I can do is read a book to stay awake
And it rips my life away, but it's a great escape
Escape

LOVEFOOL

Dear, I fear we're facing a problem
You love me no longer, I know and
Maybe there is nothing that I can do
To make you do
Mama tells me I shouldn't bother
That I ought just to stick to another man
A man that surely deserves me
But I think you do

So I cry, and I pray, and I beg

Love me, love me
Say that you love me
Fool me, fool me
Go on and fool me
Love me, love me
Pretend that you love me
Leave me, leave me
Just say that you need me
So I cry and I beg for you to
Love me, love me
Say that you love me
Leave me, leave me
Just say that you need me
I can't care about anything but you
Lately I have desperately pondered
Spent my nights awake and I wonder
What I could have done in another way
To make you stay
Reason will not lead to solution
I will end up lost in confusion
I don't care if you really care
As long as you don't go

So I cry, and I pray, and I beg

Love me, love me
Say that you love me
Fool me, fool me
Go on and fool me
Love me, love me
Pretend that you love me
Leave me, leave me
Just say that you need me
So I cry and I beg for you to
Love me, love me
Say that you love me

CALIFORNICATION

Psychic spies from China try to steal your mind's elation
An' little girls from Sweden
Dream of silver-screen quotation
And if you want these kind of dreams, it's Californication

It's the edge of the world and all of Western civilization
The Sun may rise in the east
At least it settled in a final location
It's understood that Hollywood sells Californication

Pay your surgeon very well
To break the spell of aging
Celebrity skin: is this your chin
Or is that war you're waging?
Firstborn unicorn
Hardcore soft porn

Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication

Marry me, girl; be my fairy to the world
Be my very own constellation
A teenage bride with a baby inside
Getting high on information
And buy me a star on the boulevard, it's Californication
Space may be the final frontier
But it's made in a Hollywood basement
And Cobain, can you hear the spheres singing songs off Station to Station?
And Alderaan's not far away, it's Californication

Born and raised by those who praise
Control of population
Well, everybody's been there
And I don't mean no vacation
First born unicorn

Destruction leads to a very rough road
But it also breeds creation
And earthquakes are to a girl's guitar
They're just another good vibration
And tidal waves couldn't save the world from Californication
Pay your surgeon very well
To break the spell of aging
Sicker than the rest, there is no test
But this is what you're craving

And he fills it only halfway and before I even argue
He is looking out the window at somebody coming in

I open up the paper, there's a story of an actor
Who had died while he was drinking, it was no one I had heard of
And I'm turning to the horoscope and looking for the funnies
When I'm feeling someone watching me and so I raise my head

There's a woman on the outside looking inside, does she see me?
No, she does not really see me 'cause she sees her own reflection
And I'm trying not to notice that she's hitching up her skirt
And while she's straightening her stockings, her hair has gotten wet

Miami the city that keeps the roof blazin
Party in the city where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn
Welcome to Miami
Bienvenidos a Miami
Bouncin in the club where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn
I'm goin to Miami
Welcome to Miami

Yo I heard the rainstorms ain't nothin to mess with
But I can't feel a drip on the strip, it's a trip
Ladies half-dressed, fully equipped
And they be screamin out, (Will we loved your last hit)
So I'm thinkin I'mma scoot me somethin hot
In this salsa- merengue melting pot
Hottest club in the city, and it's right on the beach
Temperature get to ya, it's about to reach
Five-hundred degrees
In the carribean seas
With the hot mamis screaming "¡Ay papi!"
Everytime I come to town, they be spottin me
In the drop Bentley, ain't no stoppin me
So, cash in your dough
And flow to this fashion show
Pound for pound anywhere you go
Yo, ain't no city in the world like this
An' if you ask how I know, I gots ta plead the fifth
Party in the city where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn
Welcome to Miami
Bienvenidos a Miami
Bouncin in the club where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn
I'm goin to Miami
Welcome to Miami

Don't get me wrong, Chi-town got it goin on
And New York is the city that we know don't sleep
And we all know that L.A. and Philly stay jiggy
But on the sneak, Miami bringin heat for real
Y'all don't understand
I never seen so many Dominican women with cinnimon tans
Mira, this is the plan
Take a walk on the beach, draw a heart in the sand
Gimmie your hand
Damn, you look sexy
Let's go to my yacht, in the West Keys
Ride my jetskis, loungin in the palm trees
Cause you gotta have cheese for the summerhouse piece on South Beach
Water so clear, you can see to the bottom
Hundred-thousand dollar cars, e'ybody got em
Ain't no surprise in the club to see Sly Stallone
Miami, my second home
Miami
Party in the city where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn
Welcome to Miami
Bienvenidos a Miami
Bouncin in the club where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn
I'm goin to Miami
Welcome to Miami
Party in the city where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn
Welcome to Miami
Bienvenidos a Miami
Bouncin in the club where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn
I'm goin to Miami
Welcome to Miami

Party in the city where the heat is on

BABY, I LOVE YOUR WAY

Ooo, baby, I love your way, everyday
Ooo, baby, I love your way, everyday
Shadows grow so long before my eyes
And they're moving across the page
Suddenly the day turns into night
Far away from the city
Well, don't hesitate
'Cause your love just won't wait
Ooo, baby, I love your way, everyday
Wanna tell you I love your way, everyday
Wanna be with you night and day
The moon appears to shine and light the skies
With the help of some fireflies
I wonder how they have the power to shine
I can see them under the pine
But don't hesitate
'Cause your love won't wait
Ooo, baby, I love your way, everyday
Wanna tell you I love your way, everyday
Wanna be with you night and day
I can see the sunset in your eyes
Brown and grey, blue besides
Clouds are stalking islands in the sun
I wish I could buy one out of season
But don't hesitate
'Cause your love won't wait, just won't wait
Ooo, baby, I love your way, everyday
Wanna tell you I love your way, everyday
Wanna be with you night and day
Ooo, baby, I love your way
Wanna tell you I love your way
Wanna be with you night and day
Ooo, baby, I love your way
Wanna tell you I love your way

BASKET CASE

Do you have the time
To listen to me whine
About nothing and everything all at once?
I am one of those
Melodramatic fools
Neurotic to the bone, no doubt about it

Sometimes, I give myself the creeps
Sometimes, my mind plays tricks on me

It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid?
Am I just stoned?

And I went to a shrink
To analyze my dreams
She says it's lack of sex that's bringing me down
And I went to a whore
He said my life's a bore
So quit my whining 'cause it's bringing her down
Sometimes, I give myself the creeps
Sometimes, my mind plays tricks on me

It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid?
Huh yeah, yeah, yeah (Ooh, ooh)

Grasping to control
So I better hold on

Sometimes, I give myself the creeps
Sometimes, my mind plays tricks on me

It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid?
Am I just stoned?

LULLABY

She grew up
With the children of the stars
In the Hollywood Hills and the boulevard
Her parents threw big parties
Everyone was there
They hung out with folks
Like Dennis Hopper and Bob Seger
And Sonny and Cher
She feels safe now in this bar on Fairfax
And from the stage
I can tell that
She can`t let go and she can`t relax
And just before
She hangs her head to cry
I sing to her a lullaby

Everything is gonna be all right
Rockabye
Rockabye
Everything is gonna be all right
Rockabye
Rockabye
Rockabye
She still lives with her mom outside the city
Down that street
About a half a mile
And all her friends tell her she`s so pretty
But she`d be a whole lot prettier
If she smiled once in a while
Cause even her smile looks like a frown
She`s seen her share of devils in this angel town

Everything is gonna be all right
Rockabye
Rockabye
Everything is gonna be all right
Rockabye
Rockabye
Rockabye

I told her
I ain`t so sure about this place
It`s hard to play a gig in this town
And keep a straight face
Seems like everybody`s got a plan
It`s kind of like Nashville with a tan
Everything is gonna be all right
Rockabye
Rockabye
Everything`s gonna be all right
Rockabye
Rockabye
Everything`s gonna be all right
Rockabye
Rockabye
Everything is gonna be all right
Rockabye
Rockabye
Everything is gonna be all right
Rockabye
Rockabye
Everything is gonna be all right
Rockabye
Rockabye
Rockabye
Bye, bye, bye, bye

REGULATE

Regulators. We regulate any stealin' of his property. We’re damn good too. But you can’t be any geek off the street. You gotta be handy with the steel, if you know what I mean. Earn your keep. Regulators, mount up!

It was a clear black night, a clear white moon
Warren G was on the streets tryin' to consume
Some skirts for the eve so I can get some phones
Rollin' in my ride, chillin' all alone

Just hit the east side of the LBC
On a mission tryin' to find Mr. Warren G
Seen a car full of girls, ain't no need to tweak
All you skirts know what's up with 213

So I hooks a left on 21 and Lewis
Some brothers shootin' dice, so I said "Let's do this!"
I jumped out the ride and said "What's up?"
Some brothers pulled some gats, so I said "I'm stuck!"

Since these girls peepin' me I'ma glide and swerve
These hookers lookin' so hard they straight hit the curb
Onto bigger, better things than some horny tricks
I see my homie and some suckas all in his mix
I'm gettin' jacked, I'm breakin' myself
I can't believe they takin' Warren's wealth
They took my rings, they took my Rolex
I looked at the brother, said "Damn, what's next?"

They got my homie hemmed up and they all around
Can't none of them see him if they goin' straight pound-for-pound
They wanna come up real quick before they start to clown
I best pull out my strap and lay them bustas down

They got guns to my head, I think I'm goin' down
I can't believe it's happenin' in my own town
If I had wings I would fly, let me contemplate
I glanced in the cut and I see my homie Nate

Sixteen in the clip and one in the hole
Nate Dogg is about to make some bodies turn cold
Now they droppin' and yellin', it's a tad bit late
Nate Dogg and Warren G had to regulate

I laid all them bustas down, I let my gat explode
Now I'm switchin' my mind back into freak mode
If you want skirts, sit back and observe
I just left a gang of hoes over there on the curb

Now, Nate got the freaks and that's a known fact
Before I got jacked I was on the same track
Back up, back up, ‘cause it's on
N-A-T-E and me, the Warren to the G

Just like I thought, they were in the same spot
In need of some desperate help
But Nate Dogg and the G child
Were in need of somethin' else
One of them dames was sexy as hell
I said "Ooh, I like your size!"
She said "My car's broke down and you seem real nice
Would you let me ride?"
I got a car full of girls and it's goin' real swell
The next stop is the Eastside Motel

I'm tweaking into a whole new era
G-funk, step to this, I dare ya
Funk on a whole new level

The rhythm is the bass and the bass is the treble

Chords, strings, we brings melody
G-funk, where rhythm is life and life is rhythm

If you know like I know
You don't wanna step to this
It's the G-funk era, funked out with a gangsta twist
If you smoke like I smoke
Then you're high like everyday
And if yo' ass is a busta, 213 will regulate

YOU MAKE ME WANNA...

This is what you do, this is what you do
This is what you do, this is what you do

You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me

Before anything began between us
You were like my best friend
The one I used to run and talk to when me and my girl was having problems
You used to say it would be okay
Suggest little nice things I should do
And when I'd go home at night and lay my head down
All I seemed to think about was you
And how...

You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me
Now, what's bad is you're the one that hooked us up
Knowing it should've been you
What's sad is I love her, but I'm falling for you
What should I do?
Should I, tell my baby bye-bye?
Should I, do exactly what I feel inside?
'Cause I, I don't wanna go, don't need to stay
But I really need to get it together

You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me

At this point, the situation's out of control
I never meant to hurt her, but I gotta let her go
And she may not understand it while all of this is going on
I tried, I tried to fight it, but the feeling's just too strong
You make, make, make me
You make me wanna...
You make me wanna...
You make me wanna...
You make me wanna...
You make me wanna...
You make me wanna...
You make me wanna...
You make me wanna...
Come along with
You're making me, you're making me

You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do

Never see Will attacking 'em
Rather play ball with Shaq and 'em, flatten 'em

BARELY BREATHING

I know what you're doing, I see it all too clear
I only taste the saline when I kiss away your tears
You really had me going, wishing on a star
But the black holes that surround you are heavier by far
I believed in your confusion, you were so completely torn
It must've been that yesterday was the day that I was born
There's not much to examine, there's nothing left to hide
You really can't be serious, you have to ask me why
I say goodbye

'Cause I am barely breathing and I can't find the air
Don't know who I'm kidding, imagining you care
And I could stand here waiting, a fool for another day
I don't suppose it's worth the price, you're worth the price, the price that I would pay

And everyone keeps asking, what's it all about?
I used to be so certain and I can't figure out
What is this attraction, I can only feel the pain
There's nothing left to reason and only you to blame
Will it ever change?

'Cause I am barely breathing and I can't find the air
Don't know who I'm kidding, imagining you care
And I could stand here waiting, a fool for another day
I don't suppose it's worth the price, you're worth the price, the price that I would pay
But I'm thinking it over anyway
I'm thinking it over anyway
I've come to find I may never know
Your changing mind, is it friend or foe
I rise above or sink below
With every time you come and go
Please don't come and go

'Cause I am barely breathing and I can't find the air
Don't know who I'm kidding, imagining you care
And I could stand here waiting, a fool for another day
I don't suppose it's worth the price, you're worth the price, the price that I would pay
But I'm thinking it over anyway
I'm thinking it over anyway

I know what you're doing, I see it all too clear
